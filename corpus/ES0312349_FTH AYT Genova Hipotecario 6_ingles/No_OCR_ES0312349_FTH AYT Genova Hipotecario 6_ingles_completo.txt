I.3. 
Name, address and rating of the auditors who may have verified the 
number, value and characteristics or attributes of the assets to be 
securitised in the Fund 
Annex IV of the Prospectus shows the audit report on the selected portfolio of 
mortgage loans granted by Barclays Bank, S.A., which will mostly be securitised. The 
securitised mortgage loans (the “Participated Mortgage Loans”) will be transferred 
to the Fund through the issue of mortgage shares (hereinafter, the “Mortgage 
Shares”). This audit report has been drawn up by PricewaterhouseCoopers Auditors, 
S.L. with ID number for tax purposes B-79031290, and registered office in Madrid, 
Paseo de la Castellana 43, a company registered with the Official Register of Account 
Auditors under number S-0242. 
The audit report informs on a series of attributes (characteristics), both quantitative 
and qualitative, of the portfolio of the Participated Mortgage Loans and, in particular, 
on the purpose of the loan, the borrower's identification, date of formalisation, 
maturity date, reference interest rate, spread, applied interest rate, initial amount of 
the loan, current balance of the loan, delays in payment, appraisal value, LTV ratio, 
location of the mortgaged property, mortgage guarantee and insurance against 
damages. 
If despite the Issuer’s confirmations and those made by the Auditors, it is detected 
during the life of the Mortgage Shares that any Participated Mortgage Loan underlying 
to them did not fully adhere on the Incorporation Date to the characteristics contained 
in paragraph IV.1.a) of the Prospectus, the Issuer undertakes, in accordance with the 
provisions set forth in paragraph IV.1.d) of the Prospectus, to substitute the 
 
 
20 


 
corresponding Mortgage Share immediately or to repay it, as the case may be. In 
accordance with paragraph IV.1.d), confirmation of the suitability of the replacement 
loan must be given by the  Auditors (or any replacement), prior to the substitution. 
I.4. 
Observations made by the Managing Company 
The Managing Company believes it is necessary to give notice of the unguaranteed 
nature of the principal amount of the Notes that will be paid on each Payment Date, 
because the main characteristic of the Notes resides in that their repayment is directly 
tied to the payments made by the debtors of the Participated Mortgage Loans, 
therefore being directly affected by the evolution, delays, anticipated payments or any 
other related incidents. 
The partial repayment of the Notes will depend on the speed of the repayment of the 
Mortgage Shares. Accordingly, there is no way to predetermine the amounts that will 
be applied to the repayment of the Notes on each Payment Date. 
The early repayment risk will be passed on to the Noteholders on a quarterly basis, on 
each Payment Date, through the partial repayment of the Notes. In any event, 
payments of principal on the Class A1 Notes rank ahead on a timing basis of 
payments of principal on the Class A2 Notes, which, in turn, rank ahead of Class B 
Notes, which, in turn, rank ahead of Class C Notes, and which, in turn, rank ahead of 
Class D Notes (except for the pro rata repayment of the principal amount of Classes 
A2, B, C and D, in accordance with paragraph II.11.3.2 below). 
It is important to note that constant annual rates of prepayment (CPR) have been 
used in the preparation of the Prospectus; these CPR are 5%, 10% and 15%, the 
range which the Managing Company, on behalf of the Fund, believes represents the 
minimum and maximum percentages of probable prepayment. However this range is 
not definitive. Please refer to paragraph II.12.b) of the Prospectus. 
It is also important to note that on the date of registration of this Prospectus the final 
spreads applicable for determination of the Nominal Interest Rate of each Class of 
Notes have not yet been determined. Consequently, the charts and examples included 
in this Prospectus which refer to (or otherwise use) the Nominal Interest Rate of the 
all Classes of Notes have been prepared (except otherwise indicated) by using the 
spreads which the Managing Company will determine on its own in the event that an 
agreement is not reached with the Entidad Directora and the Underwriting Entities on 
the final spreads applicable to each Class of Notes (0.05% for Class A1 Notes, 0.15% 
for Class A2 Notes, 0.26% for Class B Notes, 0.50% for Class C Notes and 1.75% for 
Class D Notes). 
The interest payment of all Classes is subject to the same uncertainty as described for 
the repayment of the principal, since it depends on the payments made by the 
debtors of the Participated Mortgage Loans. However, the payment of interest on the 
Class A1 and A2 Notes is less affected than the payment of interest on Class B Notes, 
which, in turn, is less affected than the payment of interest on Class C Notes, which, 
 
 
21 


 
in turn, is less affected than the payment of interest on Class D Notes, due to the 
subordinated nature of some Classes with respect to other Classes. 
It should be kept in mind that it is fundamental that the periodic information that the 
Managing Company will provide on a quarterly basis to the Noteholders and the CNMV 
is given at the times and in the forms set out in the Prospectus or as determined by 
the CNMV in the future. As a result of this information, containing actual figures rather 
than estimations, both the Noteholders and the CNMV will have a precise knowledge, 
with the abovementioned regularity, of both the evolution of the Mortgage Shares’ 
portfolio (and specifically about any delay in payment greater than ninety (90) days, 
prepayment rates, etc.) and the unpaid balances and percentages that these balances 
represent compared to the initial nominal amount of the Notes.

described in paragraph II.18.3 of the Prospectus), the Managing Company together 
with the Issuer will execute the public deed of incorporation of AyT Génova 
Hipotecario VI, Fondo de Titulización Hipotecaria, providing for the issue and 
subscription of the Mortgage Shares and issue of the  Notes (hereinafter, the 
"Incorporation Deed") in accordance with Law 19/1992 (hereinafter, June 9, 2005 
or the date of execution of the Incorporation Deed, the “Incorporation Date”). The 
Managing Company will send a copy of the Incorporation Deed to the CNMV for filing 
with the public registries prior to the commencement of the Subscription Period. 
 
The Managing Company warrants that the content of the Incorporation Deed will 
match the provisions set out in this Prospectus and the draft Incorporation Deed filed 
with the CNMV. 
In accordance with the provisions set forth in article 5.9 of Law 19/1992, the Notes 
will be exclusively represented through accounting records, and the Incorporation 
Deed will have the effects set forth in article 6 of Law 24/1988. In accordance with 
the aforesaid article, the Incorporation Deed will be the document providing for the 
representation of the Notes through accounting records and the required information 
for the identification of the Notes. 
II.1.2. Information on the requirements and prior resolutions necessary for listing 
on the Stock Exchange or in an organised secondary market 
 
In accordance with article 5.9 of Law 19/1992, immediately after the granting of the 
Incorporation Deed and once the disbursement of the Notes has been completed (as 
referred to in paragraph II.18.5), the Managing Company will request the listing of the 
Notes in the AIAF Fixed-Interest Securities Market (hereinafter, “AIAF”), which is an 
official secondary securities market recognised in the Sixth Temporary Disposition set 
forth in Law 37/1998 of 16 November amending the previous Law 24/1988. It is 
expected that actual listing will take place no later than thirty (30) days following the 
Disbursement Date (as defined in paragraph II.18.5). 
 
In the event that the listing of the Notes in the AIAF is not completed within the 
above period, the Managing Company will immediately inform the Noteholders and 
will specify the reasons, by means of an announcement published in a newspaper that 
is distributed nation-wide, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph III.5.3.b) 
and c).  Such actions shall be without prejudice to the contractual liability of the 
 
 
24 


 
Managing Company that could result from the listing of the Notes in the AIAF not 
being completed within the above period. 
 
Additionally, the Managing Company will request, on behalf of the Fund, the inclusion 
of the Notes in the Sociedad de Gestión de los Sistemas de Registro, Compensación y 
Liquidación de Valores, S.A. in order for the clearing and settlement of the Notes to be 
carried out in accordance with the Sociedad de Gestión de los Sistemas de Registro, 
Compensación y Liquidación de Valores, S.A. operating rules (existing as of the date 
hereof or which may be approved in the future) with respect to securities listed in the 
AIAF and represented by book entries. 
 
Furthermore, application will be made by the Financial Agent for the Notes to be 
accepted for clearing and settlement through Clearstream Banking Sociète Anonyme, 
Luxembourg. 
II.2. 
Administrative authorisations prior to the issue or offer. Warnings and 
considerations made by the Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores, in 
accordance with article 1, paragraph 9 of the Order of the Economy and Tax 
Ministry, of 12 July, 1993 
 
No prior administrative authorisation is required for the issue of Notes save for the 
prior registration of the Prospectus with the CNMV. 
 
The CNMV has not given any warning or opinion on the incorporation of the Fund and 
the issue of the Notes. 
II.3. 
Evaluation of the risk inherent in the securities issued by the Fund, carried 
out by a rating entity recognised by the Comisión Nacional del Mercado de 
Valores 
 
Law 19/1992 requires that the credit risk of the Notes issued by the Fund should be 
evaluated by a rating entity recognised by the CNMV. 
 
The Managing Company has entrusted the evaluation of the credit risk of the Notes to 
Standard & Poor’s España, S.A. (“S&P”), Moody’s Investors Service España, S.A. 
(“Moody’s”) and Fitch Ratings España, S.A. (“Fitch”) (together, hereinafter, the 
“Rating Agencies”), which are rating entities recognised by the CNMV for the 
purposes set forth in article 5.8 of Law 19/1992. 
 
Rating granted to the issue of the Notes 
 
Prior to the date of registration of this Prospectus, S&P assigned an AAA rating to the 
Class A1 and Class A2 Notes, an A rating to the Class B Notes, a BBB rating to the 
Class C Notes and a BB rating to the Class D Notes, all on a provisional basis. It is 
expected that the above ratings will be confirmed as final ratings by such Rating 
Agency prior to the commencement of the Subscription Period (referred to in 
paragraph II.18.3 of the Prospectus). 
 
 
25 


 
 
Prior to the date of registration of this Prospectus, Moody’s assigned an Aaa rating to 
the Class A1 and A2 Notes, an Aa3 rating to the Class B Notes, a Baa1 rating to the 
Class C Notes, and a Ba1 rating to Class D Notes, all on a provisional basis. It is 
expected that the above ratings will be confirmed as final ratings by such Rating 
Agency prior to the commencement of the Subscription Period (referred to in 
paragraph II.18.3 of the Prospectus). 
 
Prior to the date of registration of this Prospectus, Fitch assigned an AAA rating to the 
Class A1 and Class A2 Notes, an AA- rating to the Class B Notes, a BBB+ rating to the 
Class C Notes and a BB+ rating to the Class D Notes, all on a provisional basis. It is 
expected that the above ratings will be confirmed as final ratings by such Rating 
Agency prior to the commencement of the Subscription Period (referred to in 
paragraph II.18.3 of the Prospectus). 
 
Failure to confirm any of the above provisional ratings prior to the commencement of 
the Subscription Period would constitute a termination event in respect of the 
incorporation of the Fund and the issue of the Mortgage Shares and the Notes.  
The above will be immediately communicated to the CNMV and will be disclosed to 
the public as provided in paragraph III.5.3.b)2. 
 
A copy of the letters confirming the provisional ratings issued by S&P, Moody’s and 
Fitch with respect to the Notes is attached as Annex III.

The description of the meaning given by S&P to its long-term and short-term ratings 
referred to in this Prospectus is the following:  
 
S&P Long-term 
AAA 
An obligation rated “AAA” has the highest rating assigned by S&P. The 
obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is extremely 
strong. 
 
AA 
An obligation rated “AA” differs from the highest-rated obligations only in 
small degree. The obligor´s capacity to meet its financial commitment on the 
obligation is still strong. 
 
A 
An obligation rated “A” is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects 
of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higher rated 
 
 
27 


 
categories. However, the obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the 
obligation is still strong. 
 
BBB 
An obligation rated “BBB” exhibits adequate protection parametres. 
However, adverse economic conditions changing circumstances are more likely to lead 
to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the 
obligation. 
 
BB  
An obligation rated “BB” is less vulnerable to nonpayment than other 
speculative issues. However, it faces notorial ongoing uncertainties or exposure to 
adverse business, financial, or economic conditions, which could lead to the obligor´s 
inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. 
 
The ratings from “AA” to “CCC” may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus 
sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories.  
S&P Short-term 
A-1 
A short-term obligation rated “A-1” is rated in the highest category by S&P. 
The obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is strong. 
Within this category, certain obligations are designated with a plus sign (+). This 
indicates that the obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on these 
obligations is extremely strong.  
Additionally, the description of the meaning given by Moody’s to its long-term and 
short-term ratings referred to in this Prospectus is the following: 
Moody’s Long-term 
Aaa 
Notes which are rated “Aaa” are judged to be of the best quality. They carry 
the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as "gilt edged." 
Interest payments are protected by a large or by an exceptionally stable margin and 
principal is secure. 
Aa 
Notes which are rated “Aa” are judged to be of high quality by all standards. 
Together with the “Aaa” group they comprise what are generally known as high-grade 
bonds. They are rated lower than the best bonds because margins of protection may 
not be as large as in “Aaa” securities or fluctuation of protective elements may be of 
greater amplitude or there may be other elements present which make the long-term 
risk appear somewhat larger than the “Aaa” securities. 
A 
Notes which are rated “A” possess many favourable investment attributes 
and are to be considered as upper-medium-grade obligations. Factors giving security 
to principal and interest are considered adequate, but elements may be present which 
suggest a susceptibility to impairment some time in the future. 
 
 
28 


 
Baa 
Notes which are rated “Baa” are considered as medium-grade obligations. 
Interest payments and principal security appear adequate for the present but certain 
protective elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any 
great length of time. Such notes lack outstanding investment characteristics and in 
fact have speculative characteristics as well. 
Ba 
Notes which are rated “Ba” are judge to have speculative elements: their 
future cannot be considered as well-assured. Often the protection of interest and 
principal payments may be very moderate, and thereby not well safeguarded during 
both good and bad times over the future. Uncertainty of position characterizes bonds 
in this class. 
Moody’s applies numerical modifiers 1, 2, and 3 in each generic rating classification 
from “Aa” through “Caa”. The modifier 1 indicates that the obligation ranks in the 
higher end of its generic rating category; the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range 
ranking; and the modifier 3 indicates a ranking in the lower end of that generic rating 
category.  
Moody’s Short-term 
P-1 Superior ability for repayment of senior short-term debt obligations. 
P-2 
Strong ability for repayment of senior short-term debt obligations. 
Additionally, the description of the meaning given by Fitch to its long-term and short-
term ratings referred to in this Prospectus is the following: 
Fitch Long-term 
AAA  “AAA” rating assigned by Fitch denotes the highest credit quality. It is assigned 
only in case of exceptionally strong capacity to timely payment of principal and 
interest of the financial obligations. This capacity is highly unlikely to be adversely 
affected by foreseeable events. 
AA  
“AA” rating assigned by Fitch denotes a very high credit quality. It indicates a 
very strong capacity for timely payment of principal and interest. This capacity is not 
significantly vulnerable to foreseeable events.   
A  
“A” rating assigned by Fitch denotes a high credit quality. The capacity for 
timely repayment of principal and interest is strong. This capacity may, nevertheless, 
be more vulnerable to changes in circumstances or in economic conditions than in the 
case of higher ratings. 
BBB “BBB” rating assigned by Fitch indicates that there is currently a low 
expectation of credit risk. The capacity for timely payment of financial commitments is 
considered adequate, but adverse changes in circumstances and in economic 
 
 
29 


 
conditions are more likely to impair this capacity. This is the lowest investment-grade 
category. 
BB 
“BB” rating assigned by Fitch indicates that there is a possibility of credit risk 
developing, particularly as the result of economic change over the time; however, 
business or financial alternatives may be available to allow financial commitments to 
be met. Securities rated in this category are not investment grade.  
Fitch Short-term 
F1  
“F1” rating assigned by Fitch denotes the highest credit quality. It indicates the 
strongest capacity for timely payment of principal and interest. It may have and 
added “+” to denote any exceptionally strong credit feature.  
Notes to long-term and short-term ratings “+” or “-” may be added to a rating to 
denote relative status within major rating categories. Such suffixes are not added to 
the “AAA” long-term rating category, to categories below “CCC”, or to short-term 
ratings other than “F1”. 
The ratings assigned to each of the Classes of Notes by S&P measure the Fund´s 
ability to meet payments of interest as they fall due on each set Payment Date and 
repayment of the principal throughout the life of the transaction and, in any event, 
before the Final Maturity Date. 
The ratings assigned to each of the Classes of Notes by Moody´s measure the 
expected loss before the Final Maturity Date. In Moody´s opinion, the structure allows 
timely payment of interest and payment of principal during the life of the transaction 
and, in any event, before the Final Maturity Date. 
Finally, the ratings assigned to each of the Classes of Notes by Fitch measure the 
Fund´s ability to meet payments of interest as they fall due on each set Payment Date 
and repayment of the principal throughout the life of the transaction and, in any 
event, before the Final Maturity Date,, in accordance with the terms of this Prospectus 
for Classes of Notes and the rest of ancillary documentation, which provide for the 
deferral of payment of interest on Class B, C and D Notes in the event that some 
circumstances established in paragraph V.5.1.B)2 and the exceptional rules 
established in paragraph V.5.2 occur. This may imply that, while these circumstances 
resulting in the deferral of payment of interest on Class B, C and D Notes occur, 
interest may be unpaid on a given Payment Date if the Fund has not sufficient 
liquidity. Such unpaid interest will be paid on the following Payment Date on which 
the Fund has enough liquidity (paragraph II.10).  
The rating takes into account the structure of the Notes issued, their legal aspects and 
those of the Fund which has issued such Notes, the characteristics of the Participated 
Mortgage Loans and the cash flows of the structure. 
 
 
30 


 
The rating does not evaluate the probability that the mortgagors may carry out any 
early repayment of the principal amount or to what extent such early repayment may 
differ from what was originally expected. The rating does not consist, by any means, 
of a rating of the level of actual returns. 
The assigned rating, as well as any review or suspension of it: 
(i) 
is issued by the Rating Agencies on the basis of the large amount of 
information they receive and, since they do not guarantee the accuracy or 
completeness of such information,  the Rating Agencies cannot be considered in any 
way responsible for such information; and  
(ii) 
does not constitute and may under no circumstances be interpreted as an 
invitation, recommendation or inducement directed to the investors for them to carry 
out any type of operation regarding the Notes and particularly, to purchase, hold, 
encumber or sell such Notes. 
The ratings may be reviewed, suspended or withdrawn at any time by the Rating 
Agencies by reason of any information which may come to their notice. Such 
situations, which will not constitute a reason for early repayment of the Fund, will be 
immediately informed to both the CNMV and the Noteholders, in accordance with 
provisions set forth in paragraph III.5.3. 
To carry out the process of rating and follow up, the Rating Agencies rely on the 
accuracy and completeness of the information provided by the Managing Company, 
the auditors, the lawyers and other experts. 
The Managing Company undertakes, on behalf of the Fund, to provide the Rating 
Agencies with regular information on the situation of the Fund and the performance of 
the Mortgage Shares. Likewise it will provide such information when reasonably 
required to do so and always when there is a change in the conditions either of the 
Fund or the agreements entered into by the Fund through its Managing Company or 
the concerned parties. In any case, within thirty (30) days from each Payment Date, 
the Managing Company, in the name and on behalf of the Fund, shall provide to the 
Rating Agencies the information referred to in the form attached to this Prospectus as 
Annex VII.  
The Managing Company will use its best efforts to maintain the rating of the Notes at 
its initial level and, in the event that this rating drops, it will use its best efforts to 
recover it. 
II.4. 
Nature and name of the securities which are offered with an indication of 
the issue or tranche number 
The total amount of the issue of Notes amounts to a nominal amount of SEVEN 
HUNDRED MILLION EUROS (700,000,000 €) and is composed of SEVEN 
 
 
31 


 
THOUSAND (7,000) Notes. This nominal amount is divided into five Classes of 
Notes: 
(i) 
Senior notes which make up Class A1 (“Class A1 Notes”) for a total 
nominal amount of ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR MILLION EUROS 
(154,000,000 €), comprised of ONE THOUSAND, FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY 
(1,540) senior Notes having each a face value of ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
EUROS (100,000 €), represented through book entries. 
(ii) 
Senior notes which make up Class A2 (“Class A2 Notes”) for a total 
nominal amount of FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR MILLION EUROS 
(524,00,000 €), comprised of FIVE THOUSAND, TWO HUNDRED FORTY 
(5,240) senior Notes having each a face value of ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
EUROS (100,000 €), represented through book entries. 
(iii) 
Subordinated notes which make up Class B (“Class B Notes”) for a total 
nominal amount of SEVEN MILLION EUROS (7,000,000 €), comprised of 
SEVENTY (70) Notes having each a face value of ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
EUROS (100,000 €), represented through book entries. 
(iv) 
Subordinated notes which make up Class C (“Class C Notes”) for a total 
nominal amount of SEVEN MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND EUROS 
(7,700,000 €), comprised of SEVENTY SEVEN (77) Notes having each a face value 
of ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND EUROS (100,000 €), represented through book

(7,300,000 €), comprised of SEVENTY THREE (73) Notes having each a face value 
of ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND EUROS (100,000 €), represented through book 
entries. 
The repayment of the principal amount of Class A2 Notes are subordinated with 
regard to the Class A1 Notes, whereas the interest of both Series will be paid on a 
pro-rata basis. The repayment of the principal amount and payment of interest of 
Class B Notes are subordinated with regard to the Class A2 Notes, whereas the 
repayment of the principal amount and interest of the Class C Notes is subordinated 
with regard to the Class B Notes, and the repayment of the principal amount and 
interest of Class D Notes is subordinated with regard to the Class C Notes (except for 
the pro rata repayment of the principal amount of Classes A2, B, C and D in 
accordance with paragraph II.11.3.2), in accordance with the payment priority order 
contained in paragraph V.5.1.B)2 and the exceptional rules established in paragraph 
V.5.2. and the payment priority order in the event of liquidation of the Fund contained 
in paragraph V.6.1. and the exceptional rules established in paragraph V.6.2. 
 
 
32 


 
Subscription for or possession of the Notes of one Class does not entail the 
subscription for or possession of the Notes of the other Class. 
The Notes are governed by Law 19/1992, having the legal status of fixed income 
securities, homogeneous and standardised, eligible for trading in organised securities 
markets. Therefore, the Fund possesses a legal and different financial configuration to 
that of investment funds. 
II.4.1. Legal regime governing the securities, with specification of the procedures 
which guarantee the certainty and effectiveness of the rights of the first 
and subsequent holders. Implications that produce the mandatory 
connection between the timetable for payment of the principal amount  and 
interest of such securities and the flow of revenues and collections 
resulting from the assets that are securitised through the Fund, for the 
financial service of each issue of notes issued by the Fund 
The Notes are governed by Law 19/1992 of July 7, on the Regime applicable to 
Companies and Funds of Real Estate Investment and on Funds of Mortgage 
Securitisation. 
The Noteholders will be identified as such in accordance with the accounting records 
kept by the Sociedad de Gestión de los Sistemas de Registro, Compensación y 
Liquidación de Valores, S A., as provided in paragraph II.5. Ownership certificates 
may be issued at the Noteholder’s request and at its expense in accordance with the 
provisions set forth in the fourth section of Chapter 1 of Title I of Royal Decree 
116/1992, of 14 February on the representation of securities through book entries and 
clearing and settlement of stock market transactions (“Royal Decree 116/1992”). 
.
The Notes may be freely transferred by any means permitted by law. The ownership 
of each Note will be transferred through an accounting record transfer. The 
registration of the transfer in favour of the purchaser in the accounting record will 
produce the same effects as delivery of the security were title to the security capable 
of being transferred by delivery and from that moment on, the transfer will be 
effective vis-a-vis third parties. 
The Managing Company, acting on behalf of the Fund, will enter into a “Financial 
Services Agreement” with Barclays Bank, S.A. (hereinafter, and for these purposes, 
the "Financial Agent") whereby the Managing Company shall invest the amounts 
received on behalf of the Fund in a Cash Account opened with the Financial Agent in 
the name of the Fund. The balance of the Cash Account shall accrue interest at a 
monthly average of EONIA interest rate (Euro Overnight Interest Average), calculated 
by the European Central Bank and published by REUTERS in its page EONIA, 
corresponding to the previous month, whilst the credit rating of the non-subordinated 
and unsecured short-term debt of Barclays Bank PLC at any moment in time is not 
lower than A-1, P-1 or F1 (its current ratings being A-1+, P-1 and F1+), according to 
the rating scales for short-term risks of S&P, Moody’s and Fitch, respectively, and the 
 
 
33 


 
shareholding of Barclays Bank PLC in the Financial Agent is equal to or exceeds of 
51%. In the event that any of the above referred credit ratings is reduced or if the 
shareholding of Barclays Bank PLC in the Financial Agent falls below the above-
mentioned percentage, then the Financial Agent, within thirty (30) Business Days from 
the assignment of this lower rating or from the reduction of Barclays Bank PLC’s 
holding in the Financial Agent below the above mentioned percentage: 
(a) 
shall obtain from a credit entity with a short-term risk rating of at least A-1, 
P-1 and F1 (in accordance with S&P, Moody’s and Fitch short-term debt rating scales, 
respectively), a joint and several first demand guarantee as security for the amounts 
deposited in the Cash Account, or 
(b) 
shall transfer the Cash Account of the Fund to an entity with a non-
subordinated and unsecured short-term debt of at least A-1, P-1 and F1 ratings (in 
accordance with S&P, Moody’s and Fitch short-term debt rating scales, respectively), 
arranging for the best obtainable return of the balances of the Cash Account, or 
(c) 
if options a) and b) above are not possible, the Managing Company shall 
obtain from the Financial Agent or a third party collateral security in favour of the 
Fund on financial assets with a credit rating of not less than that of the Spanish State 
Government Debt (“Deuda Pública del Es ado Español”), in an amount sufficient to 
guarantee the commitments established in the Financial Services Agreement, or 
t
(d) 
if none of the above-mentioned measures may be achieved, the Managing 
Company will replace the Financial Agent with another credit entity with a short-term 
debt rating of at least A-1, P-1 and F1 (in accordance with S&P, Moody’s and Fitch 
short-term debt rating scales, respectively), obtaining the best obtainable return of 
the balances of the Cash Account. 
In event (b) above, the Managing Company will subsequently transfer the balances of 
the Cash Account back to the Financial Agent, provided that the non-subordinated and 
unsecured short-term debt of Barclays Bank PLC is assigned the aforementioned A-1, 
P-1 and F1 ratings and the stake held by Barclays Bank PLC in the Financial Agent is 
equal or higher than 51%.  
The substitution of the Financial Agent will in no event negatively affect the ratings of 
the Notes. 
Likewise, in the event that the ratings on the non-subordinated and unsecured short-
term debt of Barclays Bank PLC falls to A-1 (in accordance with S&P short-term debt 
rating scale), if the balance of the Cash Account exceeds 20% of the Unpaid Principal 
Balance of the Notes on a given Payment Date, the Managing Company will deposit 
the difference on an account (the “Excess Balance Account”) opened by the 
Managing Company in another credit entity whose short-term debt is assigned a 
minimum rating of A-1+ (in accordance the aforementioned rating scale), arranging 
for the best obtainable return of such balance. 
 
 
34 


 
Similarly, in the event that the non-subordinated and unsecured short-term debt of 
Barclays Bank PLC attains again the A-1+ rating (in accordance with S&P short-term 
debt rating scale), the Managing Company will subsequently transfer to the Cash 
Account opened with the Financial Agent the then balance of the Excess Balance 
Account.  
II.4.2. Other implications and risks that, due to the legal and economic nature of 
the assets which are grouped together in the Fund, might affect  the 
financial servicing of the securities issued by the Fund as a result of the 
securitisation of such assets 
a) 
Risk of non-payment of the Mortgage Shares 
In accordance with article 5.8 of Law 19/1992, the risk of non-payment of the 
Mortgage Shares shall be borne by the Noteholders.  
As a result, the Issuer will assume no responsibility for any default of payment by the 
mortgagors, whether of principal, interest or any other amounts which might be owed 
by such mortgagors under the Participated Mortgage Loans. It will also assume no 
responsibility for ensuring, directly or indirectly, the successful completion of the 
transaction nor will it grant any backing or guarantee, or enter into any repurchase 
agreement in connection with the Mortgage Shares, save for those which did not 
comply on the Incorporation Date with the conditions and characteristics contained in 
paragraph IV.1.a) of the Prospectus and in accordance with the provisions set forth 
therein. 
b) 
Risk of early repayment of the Mortgage Shares 
Through the issue of Mortgage Shares, the Issuer, in the terms described in  Chapter 
IV of the Prospectus, allows the Fund to participate in the principal and interest of the 
Participated Mortgage Loans granted by the Issuer. 
The Mortgage Shares contained in the Fund are open to early repayment when 
borrowers of the Participated Mortgage Loans prepay part of the capital pending 
amortisation, in the terms set out in each of the relevant loan deeds.  Similarly, the 
Mortgage Shares will be amortised entirely in the event the Issuer is substituted 
(subrogated) in the relevant Participated Mortgage Loans by other financial entities, 
subject to Law 2/1994, of March 30, on Subrogation and Amendment of Mortgage 
Loans, as amended, among others, by Royal Decree-Law 2/2003, of April 25 ("Law 
2/1994"). 
The risk of early repayment will be transferred on a quarterly basis, on each Payment 
Date, to the Noteholders through their partial repayment in accordance with the 
provisions set forth in paragraph II.11.3.2 of the Prospectus. 
c) 
Limited Protection  
 
 
35 


 
 
An investment in the Notes could be affected, among other things, by a deterioration 
in general economical conditions that shall produce a negative effect on the payments 
of the Participated Mortgage Loans which support the Issue of Notes by the Fund. In 
the event that there are significant levels of default defaults on payments of 
Participated Mortgage Loans, the limited protection against losses in the portfolio of 
Participated Mortgage Loans which results from the credit enhancement described in 
paragraph V.3 of the Prospectus may be reduced or even lost. Furthermore, the level 
of subordination in payments of interest and repayment of principal of some Classes 
of Notes with regard to other Classes of Notes allows more senior Classes to have 
greater protection than more junior Classes. 
 
d) 
Liquidity 
 
There is no assurance that the Notes will be traded on the market with a minimum 
frequency or volume. 
 
There is no commitment of any entity to trade in the secondary market in order to 
give liquidity to the Notes by offering a counterparty. 
 
In no case shall the Fund repurchase the Notes from the Noteholders, although the 
Notes may be early and totally repaid in the event of Early Liquidation of the Fund, as 
set out in paragraph III.8.1 of the Prospectus. 
 
e)  
Profitability 
 
The fulfilment of the repayment of the Participated Mortgage Loans is affected by a 
variety of geographical, economic and social factors such as seasonality, market 
interest rates, the economic and labour situation of the Debtors and the general 
economic circumstances, which avoid its foresee-ability. 
 
The calculation of the Internal Rate of Return, of the average life and maturity of the 
Notes included in the Prospectus is based on several hypothesis, such as early 
repayment rates and non-payment rates of the Participated Mortgage Loans which 
may not become true, as well as on future market interest rates, due to the fact that 
the nominal interest rate of each Class is variable. 
 
f)  
Lack of actions 
 
The Noteholders and the remaining creditors of the Fund shall have no action against 
the Debtors of the Participated Mortgage Loans that have not fulfilled their payment 
obligations, being the Managing Company, as representative of the Fund, the holder 
of such actions. 
 
 
 
36 


 
The Noteholders and the remaining creditors of the Fund shall have no action against 
the Fund or the Managing Company in the event of payment default of the Fund 
which arises from early repayment of non-payment of the Mortgage Shares, in the 
event of default of the counterparties of the transactions entered into in the name and 
on behalf of the Fund or because of non-sufficiency of the financial operations of 
coverage to comply with the payment obligations of the Notes of each Class. 
 
The Noteholders and the remaining creditors of the Fund shall not have other action 
against the issuer of the Mortgage Shares or the Managing Company, respectively, 
than those arising from non-fulfilment of their respective duties and, consequently, 
never as a result of non-payment or early repayment.  
 
II.5. 
Form of representation and name and address of the entity in charge of its 
accounting record 
The Notes will be represented by means of book entries in accordance with article 5.9 
of Law 19/1992 and will be incorporated as such by means of their registration in the 
relevant accounting record. The Incorporation Deed will have the effects set forth in

Interest rate clause 
II.10.1. Nominal interest rate 
All Classes of Notes will bear an annual nominal interest rate, which may be varied 
quarterly and is payable on a quarterly basis.  
 
 
39 


 
The annual nominal interest rate (hereinafter, the “Nominal Interest Rate”) will be 
paid on a quarterly basis on each Payment Date, on the Unpaid Principal Balance of 
the Notes of each Class (both concepts are described below, in paragraphs II.10.3 
and II.11.3.2.3, respectively) provided that the Fund has sufficient liquidity in 
accordance with the payment priority order set out in paragraph V.5.1.B)2 and the 
exceptional rules provided in paragraph V.5.2. and the payment priority order in the 
event of liquidation of the Fund contained in paragraph V.6.1. and the exceptional 
rules established in paragraph V.6.2. 
The withholdings, levies, duties and taxes already established or to be established in 
the future on capital, interest or returns of the Notes, will be solely borne by the 
Noteholders and their value will be calculated, as the case may be, by the Managing 
Company, in the name and on behalf of the Fund, in the manner established by law. 
a) 
Accrued interest 
The duration of the issue will be divided into successive “Interest Accrual Periods” 
which will include the effective days elapsed between each Payment Date, the initial 
Payment Date being included in each Interest Accrual Period and the final Payment 
Date being excluded, in accordance with the general regime and the exceptions set 
forth in paragraph II.10.3. Exceptionally, the first Interest Accrual Period will have a 
duration other than three months and equivalent to the time elapsed between the 
Disbursement Date (inclusive) and the first Payment Date (exclusive), being calculated 
on the basis of a year of 360 days in both cases. 
b) 
Nominal Interest rate 
The Nominal Interest Rate for each Interest Accrual Period will be that resulting from 
adding (i) the reference interest rate or, if required, its substitute, both described in 
paragraph c) below, and (ii) a spread for each Class: 
• Class A1: spread ranging between 0.02% and 0.10%, both inclusive. 
• Class A2: spread ranging between 0.10% and 0.20%, both inclusive. 
• Class B: spread ranging between 0.16% and 0.36%, both inclusive. 
• Class C: spread ranging between 0.30% and 0.70%, both inclusive. 
• Class D: spread ranging between 1.25% and 2.25%. both inclusive. 
The spread applicable to each Class of Notes, expressed as a percentage, shall be 
determined by the Managing Company, with, to the extent possible, the prior 
agreement of the Entidad Directora and the Underwriting Entities, before 11:00 hours 
(CET) of the day of commencement of the Subscription Period. 
The final spreads applicable to each Class of Notes shall be notified in written form by 
the Managing Company, before the commencement of the Subscription Period, to the 
 
 
40 


 
Entidad Directora and the Underwriting Entities, for notification to potential investors 
which may be interested in subscribing the Notes. The Managing Company shall also 
notify the CNMV as additional information to this Prospectus. 
The final spreads applicable to each Class of Notes shall be included in the notarial 
deed of disbursement of the Notes. 
In the event that an agreement is not reached with the Entidad Directora and the 
Underwriting Entities, the Managing Company will determine the following final 
spreads on its own: 
• Class A1: spread of 0.05%. 
• Class A2: spread of 0.15%. 
• Class B: spread of 0.26%. 
• Class C: spread of 0.50%. 
• Class D: spread of 1.75%. 
c) 
Calculation of the reference Euribor interest rate 
(i) 
The reference interest rate for the determination of the applicable interest 
rate of the Notes will be, for the first Interest Accrual Period, the interpolation of the 
four (4) month Euribor interest rate “Euro InterBank Offered Rate” and the five (5) 
month Euribor interest rate and, for all other Interest Accrual Periods, the three (3) 
months Euribor interest rate, in each case, calculated and distributed by the financial 
information system BRIDGE by order of the FBE ("Federation Bancaire de l’Union 
Europeene"), as determined at 11 hours in the morning (CET time, “Central European 
Time”) on the Interest Rate Fixing Date, described in paragraph d) below, which is 
presently published in the EURIBOR01 electronic pages, supplied by Reuters, and 248, 
supplied by Dow Jones Markets (Bridge Telerate), or any other substitute page which 
may provide these services in the future. 
The above mentioned interpolation shall take into account the number of days 
elapsed from (and including) the Disbursement Date (as defined in paragraph II.18.5 
below) to (but excluding) the first Payment Date. 
The calculation of the above referred interpolation shall be made as follows: 
TCa = (TL - TC) /( DL - DC) x (DCa - DC) + TC 
Where: 
TCa 
is the interest rate resulting from the interpolation, expressed in percentage; 
TL 
is the interest rate of the long period (5 months), expressed in percentage; 
 
 
41 


 
TC 
is the interest rate of the short period (4 months), expressed in percentage; 
DL 
is the number of days of the long period (150 days); 
DC 
is the number of days of the short period (120 days); and  
DCa 
is the number of days elapsed from the Disbursement Date (included) to the 
first Payment Date (excluded). 
The investor may find an example of the application of this interpolation method in 
paragraph II.12.a) below. 
The Euribor interest rate is currently the interest rate offered for interbanking deposits 
in euros, calculated on the basis of the daily average quotation supplied by a panel 
composed of 57 banks, which are among the most active banks in the Euro Zone. The 
interest rate is quoted on the basis of the number of real days up to the date of 
maturity and the year being composed for 360 days and is fixed at 11:00 hours in the 
morning (CET time) and expressed to three (3) decimal places. 
(ii) 
In the event that the interest rate set forth in the above paragraph (i) would 
be impossible to obtain or in the absence of this interest rate, the substitute reference 
interest rate will be the interest rate resulting from calculating the simple arithmetic 
mean of the interbanking interest rates offered for operations of non-transferable 
deposits in euros with three (3) months or, if in respect of the first Interest Accrual 
Period, between four (4) and five (5) months maturity, on the Interest Rate Fixing 
Date, which may be quoted by the banks listed below (the “Reference Banks”) upon 
request from the Managing Company through the Financial Agent. 
¾ 
Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, S.A. 
¾ 
Banco Santander Central Hispano, S.A. 
¾ 
Confederación Española de Cajas de Ahorros 
¾ 
Deutsche Bank AG 
In the event that the above substitutive reference interest rate was impossible to 
apply due to a continuous failure to supply the quotation statement by any of the 
above Reference Banks, the interest rate to be applied will be that resulting from 
applying the simple arithmetic mean of the interest rates stated by those Reference 
Banks offering interest rates provided that at least two (2) Reference Banks provide 
interest rates. 
iii) 
In case of absence or impossibility of obtaining the interest rates provided in 
paragraphs (i) and (ii) above, the interest rate to be applied will be the last reference 
interest rate applied to the last Interest Accrual Period and so on for the subsequent 
Interest Accrual Periods for as long as this situation continues. As for the first Interest 
Accrual Period, the above mentioned interpolation shall be made with the latest four 
(4) month Euribor interest rate and five (5) month Euribor interest rate available 
 
 
42 


 
immediately before 11:00 hours in the morning (CET time) on the Interest Rate Fixing 
Date calculated and distributed as described in paragraph (i) above. 
The Managing Company will keep the listings with the content of the EURIBOR01 of 
Reuters and 248 of Telerate screens or, as the case may be, the quotation statements 
of the Reference Banks, as documents evidencing the applied Euribor rate. 
d) 
Interest Rate Fixing Date 
Except for the first Interest Accrual Period, the Nominal Interest Rate applicable to all 
Classes of Notes for each Interest Accrual Period will be determined by the Managing 
Company, in the name and on behalf of the Fund, at 11:00 hours (CET) of the second 
Business Day preceding each Payment Date (hereinafter "Interest Rate Fixing 
Date").  This rate will be applicable to the next Interest Accrual Period. 
The reference interest rate for the first Interest Accrual Period will be determined at 
11:00 hours (CET) of the Incorporation Date, while the Nominal Interest Rate of all 
Classes of Notes for the first Interest Accrual Period will be determined before 11:00 
hours (CET) of the day of commencement of the Subscription Period (once the final 
spreads are fixed), and it will be notified in written form by the Managing Company, 
before the commencement of the Subscription Period, to the Entidad Directora and 
the Underwriting Entities, for notification to potential investors which may be 
interested in subscribing the Notes. Additionally, the Managing Company shall also 
notify, as additional information to this Prospectus, the CNMV, the governing authority 
of AIAF and the Sociedad de Gestión de los Sistemas de Registro, Compensación y 
Liquidación de Valores, S A. 
.
The Nominal Interest Rate determined for Notes of each Class for the subsequent 
Interest Accrual Periods shall be informed to the Noteholders as provided in 
paragraphs III.5.3 a) and c). 
For the purposes of the issue of the Notes and during their life, “Business Days” 
shall mean any day other than: 
¾ 
a Saturday, 
¾ 
a Sunday, 
¾ 
a day on which the Trans European Automated Real-Time Gross Settlement 
Express Transfer System (the TARGET System) in force is closed for 
business, which in 2005 are: January 1, Good Friday, Easter Monday, May 1, 
December 25 and December 26, 
¾ 
a day which is a public holiday in Madrid.

and eleventh (11th) place in the payment priority order in the event of liquidation of 
the Fund contained in paragraph V.6.1. and the exceptional rules established in 
paragraph V.6.2. 
II.10.3. Dates, place, entities and procedure for payment of interest 
The interest accrued by the all Classes of Notes will be paid on January 15, April 15, 
July 15 and October 15 of each year, the first Payment Date being October 17, 2005, 
until the Notes are fully repaid (each one of these dates subject as provided below, a 
"Payment Date") in accordance with the procedure set out in paragraph II.12 of the 
Prospectus.  
In the case that any of the dates set forth in the above paragraph are not Business 
Days, the Payment Date will be the next subsequent Business Day, with interest 
corresponding to the current Interest Accrual Period described in paragraph II.10.1.a), 
accruing up to the above mentioned next subsequent Business Date, not inclusive. 
The first Payment Date of interest for all Classes of Notes will be October 17, 2005, 
with interest accruing at the relevant Nominal Interest Rate from the Disbursement 
Date (provided in paragraph II.18.5), inclusive, up until but not including October 17, 
2005. 
Interest to be paid on each Payment Date for each Interest Accrual Period will be 
calculated in accordance with the following formula: 
I = P x R x d/360 
Being: 
 
I = Interest to be paid on a given Payment Date 
 
P = Unpaid Principal Balance of each Note on the Calculation Date 
corresponding to such Payment Date 
 
R = Nominal Interest Rate expressed in annual percentage 
 
d = Number of effective days which correspond to each Interest Accrual 
Period 
 
 
45 


 
Interest accrued in favour of the Noteholders of all Classes of Notes, calculated as 
provided above, and the amount of the accrued but unpaid interest, shall be 
communicated as described in paragraph III.5.3.a) of the Prospectus, at least one (1) 
calendar day in advance of each Payment Date. 
The payment of the accrued interest of the Notes shall take place on each Payment 
Date, provided that the Fund has sufficient liquidity for such purpose in accordance 
with the payment priority order provided in paragraph V.5.1.B)2 of the Prospectus and 
the exceptional rules set forth in paragraph V.5.2. and the payment priority order in 
the event of liquidation of the Fund contained in paragraph V.6.1. and the exceptional 
rules established in paragraph V.6.2. 
In the event that the Fund fails to provide for the total or partial payment of interest 
accrued on the Notes of either Class on a given Payment Date in accordance with the 
relevant payment priority order set forth in paragraph V.5.1.B)2 of the Prospectus and 
the exceptional rules set forth in paragraph V.5.2 and the payment priority order in 
the event of liquidation of the Fund contained in paragraph V.6.1. and the exceptional 
rules established in paragraph V.6.2., the amounts which the Noteholders have not 
received shall be paid on the next Payment Date. Any deferred amounts of interest 
will accrue, in favour of the Noteholders, at the same interest rate as that applied to 
the Unpaid Principal Balance of the Notes of their respective Class during the Interest 
Accrual Period/s until the Payment Date on which such deferred amounts of interest 
are paid, without accruing any interest for delayed payment and not involving any 
capitalisation of the debt. 
The Fund may not defer payment of interest of the Notes to a date later than January 
15, 2038 or, if this is a non-Business Day, the next Business Day (hereinafter, the 
“Final Maturity Date”). 
The financial servicing of the Notes will be carried out by the Financial Agent, who has 
entered into the Financial Services Agreement with the Managing Company, on behalf 
of the Fund. 
In order to better explain to the subscriber the calculation system used for fixing the 
applicable Nominal Interest Rate and the amount of interest which may correspond to 
each Note on each Payment Date, paragraph II.12 shows a practical example as well 
as theoretical charts in relation to the financial servicing of the loan. 
II.11. 
Repayment of securities 
II.11.1. Repayment price specifying the existence of any premiums, lots or any 
other financial benefits 
The repayment price for all Classes of Notes will be one hundred thousand (100,000) 
euros per Note, equivalent to 100% of their nominal amount, to be paid in 
instalments on each Payment Date. 
 
 
46 


 
All the Notes in the same Class will be repaid in equal amounts by reducing the 
nominal amount of each one of them. The amount to be reimbursed for the 
repayment of the Notes of each Class on each Payment Date will be determined in 
accordance with provisions set forth in paragraph II.11.3.

paragraph V.6.1. and the exceptional rules established in paragraph V.6.2. 
The payment of the principal of the Class C Notes occupies eleventh (11th) place in 
the payment priority order established in paragraph V.5.1.B)2 and the exceptional 
rules set out in paragraph V.5.2 and, in particular, in accordance with the rules under 
“Allocation of the Available Principal Funds for Repayment between the Notes of each 
of the Classes” that are established in paragraph II.11.3.2.1. and tenth (10th) place in 
the payment priority order in the event of liquidation of the Fund contained in 
paragraph V.6.1. and the exceptional rules established in paragraph V.6.2. 
The payment of the principal of the Class D Notes occupies twelfth (12th) place in the 
payment priority order established in paragraph V.5.1.B)2 and the exceptional rules

set out in paragraph V.5.2 and, in particular, in accordance with the rules under 
“Allocation of the Available Principal Funds for Repayment between the Notes of each 
of the Classes” that are established in paragraph II.11.3.2.1. and twelfth (12th) place 
in the payment priority order in the event of liquidation of the Fund contained in 
paragraph V.6.1. and the exceptional rules established in paragraph V.6.2. 
II.11.3. Modes of repayment, specifying their dates, place, entities, procedure and 
publicity 
II.11.3.1. Final Repayment 
The Final Maturity Date and date of final repayment for all Classes of Notes will be 
January 15, 2038 or, in the event this date is not a Business Day, the next Business 
Day, without prejudice to any early repayment of the Notes that the Managing 
Company may carry out in the name and on behalf of the Fund in accordance with 
paragraph II.11.3.3 below. In which case, the Payment Date when such early 
repayment takes place will be the final date of repayment of the Notes. 
II.11.3.2. Partial repayment 
Notwithstanding the aforesaid, the Fund will make, through its Managing Company, 
partial repayments of all Classes of Notes in the terms which are described below. 
1. 
Repayment dates  
The repayment dates will coincide with the Payment Dates for interest and 
accordingly will be January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year or, if 
applicable, the next Business Day, the first Payment Date being October 17, 2005, in 
accordance all as determined under paragraph II.10.3, up until their full repayment. 
Class A1 Notes 
The repayment of the Class A1 Notes will be carried out pro rata between them on 
each Payment Date, by reducing the nominal value of each Note until repayment is 
completed. 
The first Payment Date of the Class A1 Notes will be October 17, 2005, in accordance 
with the rules set forth in paragraph II.10.3. 
Class A2 Notes 
The repayment of the Class A2 Notes will be carried out pro rata between them on 
each Payment Date, by reducing the nominal value of each Note until repayment is 
completed. 
The first Payment Date of the Class A2 Notes will be the Payment Date on which Class 
A1 Notes are fully repaid.  
 
 
48 


 
Class B Notes 
The repayment of the Class B Notes will be carried out pro rata between them on 
each Payment Date, as the case may be, by reducing the nominal value of each Note 
until repayment is completed. 
Class C Notes 
The repayment of the Class C Notes will be carried out pro rata between them on 
each Payment Date, as the case may be, by reducing the nominal value of each Note 
until repayment is completed. 
Class D Notes 
The repayment of the Class D Notes will be carried out pro rata between them on 
each Payment Date, as the case may be, by reducing the nominal value of each Note 
until repayment is completed. 
Even if the Class A2 Notes have not been fully repaid, Class B Notes,  Class C Notes 
and Class D Notes may be partially repaid in accordance with the following rules of 
“Allocation of the Available Principal Funds for Repayment between the Notes of each 
of the Classes”: 
1st Available Principal Funds for Repayment shall be fully allocated for repayment of 
Class A1 Notes until the Payment Date on which Class A1 Notes have been fully 
repaid. 
2nd Once Class A1 Notes have been fully repaid and until the first Payment Date 
(included) on which the Unpaid Principal Balance of Class B, Class C and Class D 
Notes is, in comparison with the Unpaid Principal Balance of all Classes of Notes, 
equal or greater than 6.3%, the Available Principal Funds for Repayment shall be fully 
allocated for repayment of Class A2 Notes.  
3rd After the Payment Date on which the ratio between the Unpaid Principal Balance 
of Class B, Class C and Class D Notes and the Unpaid Principal Balance of all Classes 
of Notes, is equal or greater than 6.3%, the Available Principal Funds for Repayment 
shall be allocated for repayment of Class A2, B, C and D Notes, pro rata among them, 
in such a way that the ratio remains at 6.3% or the nearest higher percentage. 
This notwithstanding, pro rata repayment of Class A2, B, C and D Notes shall be 
interrupted and the Available Principal Funds for Repayment shall be allocated for 
repayment of the Classes on a sequential basis in accordance with their priority order 
on any Payment Date on which any of the following circumstances occurs: 
a) 
The Principal Balance of the Mortgage Shares with a delay in payment of overdue 
amounts greater than ninety (90) days is higher than 2% of the Principal Balance of 
 
 
49 


 
the Mortgage Shares on the Calculation Date corresponding to the current Payment 
Date. 
b) 
The amount of the Reserve Fund is lower than its Required Amount. 
Once the circumstances producing the interruption in the pro rata repayment of 
Classes A2, B, C and D have disappeared, the referred pro rata repayment will be 
carried out again.  
4th After the first Payment Date on which the amount of the Mortgage Shares 
pending repayment is lower than 10% of their initial amount, pro rata repayment of 
Classes A2, B, C and D Notes shall be interrupted and the Available Principal Funds for 
Repayment shall be allocated for repayment of the Classes on a sequential basis in 
accordance with their priority order until their repayment is completed. 
Any amounts that the Noteholders may not collect as a result of the existence of a 
Principal Deficiency will be paid on the next Payment Date on which it may be 
possible, such amounts providing no right to any additional or delayed payment 
interest whatsoever (since they will form part of the affected Unpaid Principal Balance 
of the Notes of the same Class on which the calculation of the payment of interest will 
be based as provided in paragraph II.10.3 above). 
The Managing Company will notify to the Noteholders as provided in paragraph 
III.5.3.a) the repayment amounts to be distributed, the Unpaid Principal Balances of 
the Notes, the Principal Deficiency, if any, as well as the actual rates of early 
repayment of the Participated Mortgage Loans and their remaining term estimated on 
the Calculation Date previous to each Payment Date. 
2. 
Calculation Dates and Periods   
"Calculation Dates" are those in which the Managing Company on behalf of the 
Fund, will carry out the required calculations to distribute or withhold the Funds 
Available on such dates, in accordance with the payment priority order set forth in 
paragraph V.5.1.B)2 and the exceptional rules set out in paragraph V.5.2. and the 
payment priority order in the event of liquidation of the Fund contained in paragraph 
V.6.1. and the exceptional rules established in paragraph V.6.2. 
The Calculation Date for each relevant period will be the fifth (5th) Business Day prior 
to each Payment Date and the periods comprised between two subsequent 
Calculation Dates will be called "Calculation Periods", with the initial Calculation 
Date being included in each Calculation Period and the final Calculation Date being 
excluded. 
As an exception, the first Calculation Period will be that comprised between the 
Incorporation Date (inclusive) and the first Calculation Date (exclusive). 
3. 
Unpaid Principal Balances of the Notes 
 
 
50 


 
“Unpaid Principal Balances of the Notes” will be the balances of the principal of 
the Notes pending amortisation, including the amounts of principal accrued on 
previous Payment Dates and not paid due to lack of Available Funds, as provided in 
paragraph 4 below, and in accordance with the payment priority order described in 
paragraph V.5.1.B)2 and the exceptional rules set out in paragraph V.5.2. and the 
payment priority order in the event of liquidation of the Fund contained in paragraph 
V.6.1. and the exceptional rules established in paragraph V.6.2. 
4. 
Principal Due for Repayment on each Payment Date 
The “Principal Due for Repayment” of all Classes of Notes, without distinguishing 
between them, will be equal to the difference between the Unpaid Principal Balance of 
the Notes and the Principal Balance of the Mortgage Shares, in accordance with the 
following paragraph, on the Calculation Date prior to each Payment Date, provided 
that such difference is positive. 
The “Principal Balance of the Mortgage Shares” will, for these purposes, be the 
sum of (i) the capital outstanding and (ii) the capital due but not paid to the Fund, on 
each of the Mortgage Shares, less in this latter case the capital of the Participated 
Mortgage Loans, whether due or not, with a delay in the payment of any principal or 
interest overdue amounts equal to or greater than eighteen (18) months. 
With the purpose of illustrating this concept, let us imagine the following practical 
case: 
 
 
Euros 
• 
Unpaid Principal Balance of the Notes of all Classes 
of Notes on a given Calculation Date  
 
500,000,000 
• 
Principal Balance of the Mortgage Shares on the 
same date 
 
480,000,000 
• 
Difference 
(Principal Due for Repayment of the Notes) 
 
20,000,000 
 
 
 
In this illustration, the Principal Due for Repayment of the Notes will be twenty million 
(20,000,000) euros. 
5. 
Resulting amount to be paid by reason of the repayment on each Payment 
Date and of any Principal Deficiency 
The amount to be allocated to repay the Notes (the “Available Principal Funds for 
Repayment”) on each Payment Date shall be lower of the following amounts: 
(i) 
the Principal Due for Repayment; and 
(ii) 
depending on the liquidity existing on such Payment Date, the Available 
Funds that are available for satisfaction of items number 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 in 
 
 
51 


 
accordance with the payment priority order set forth in paragraph V.5.1.B)2) and the 
exceptional rules set out in paragraph V.5.2 and in accordance with the allocation 
rules of the Available Principal Funds for Repayment of the principal of both Classes 
that are established in paragraph II.11., or for the satisfaction of items number 5, 6, 
8, 10, and 12 in accordance with the payment priority order in the event of liquidation 
of the Fund set forth in paragraph V.6.1., in the light of the exceptional rules set out 
in paragraph V.6.2. 
 
The “Principal Deficiency” will be the positive difference, if any, between the 
Principal Due for Repayment of the Notes and the Available Principal Funds for 
Repayment on any given date. 
 
 
Continuing with our previous example: 
Euros 
• 
Principal Due for Repayment of the Notes 
 
20,000,000 
• 
Due to the Fund not having enough liquidity, 
Available Principal Funds for Repayment to pay 
the Principal Due for Repayment of the Notes 
 
18,000,000 
• 
Principal Deficiency 
2,000,000 
In this example a Principal Deficiency would exist for an amount of two million 
(2,000,000) euros. 
 
II.11.3.3.  Early Repayment 
Without prejudice to the obligation of the Fund, through the Managing Company, to 
repay the Notes on the Final Maturity Date or partially on each Payment Date, the 
Managing Company will be empowered, subject to prior communication to the CNMV, 
to liquidate the Fund on a Payment Date, if the amount of Mortgage Shares pending 
repayment is less than 10% of the initial balance of the Mortgage Shares portfolio in 
accordance with Article 5.3 of Law 19/1992. This faculty will be subject to the 
condition that the early repayment of the Mortgage Shares plus the existing balance 
of the Cash Account and, if appropriate, of the Excess Balance Account, allows a total 
cancellation of the obligations due to the Noteholders (in the manner established in 
paragraph III.8.1), after fulfilling the payment priority order as described in paragraph 
V.6.1 and the exceptional rules set out in paragraph V.6.2. 
Article 5.6 of Law 19/1992 requires that the flows of principal and interests 
corresponding to the Notes issued by the Fund coincide with the cash flows generated 
by the Mortgage Shares contained in the Fund, without any temporary lags other than 
those which derive from the fees and the administrative and management expenses, 
insurance premiums or other applicable items. If by reason of any event or 
exceptional circumstance not expected on the date the Incorporation Deed was 
 
 
52 


 
executed, the financial balance of the Fund required by Law 19/1992 is permanently 
and negatively affected for reasons not attributable to the operation of the Fund, such 
as a new legal regime or additional legal regulations, withholdings or other situations 
that could affect this balance permanently, the Managing Company may be entitled to 
repay the Notes in advance, in the name and on behalf of the Fund. For the avoidance 
of doubt, the possible existence of a Principal Deficiency shall not in itself be 
considered as causing a deterioration of the financial balance of the Fund to the 
extent this arises in the ordinary course of the Fund’s business. 
The Managing Company, in the name and on behalf of the Fund, may also early 
liquidate the Fund in the event that: (i) the Mortgage Shares are fully repaid, (ii) a 
relevant breach of payment exists or it is foreseen that there will be one, and such 
breach produces a significant permanent unbalance related to any of the Notes 
issued, or (iii) the Notes are fully repaid (no later than the Final Maturity Date).  
In addition, the early liquidation of the Fund and the repayment of the Notes will take 
place in the event that the Managing Company is declared to be in liquidation or 
insolvency (“concurso”) in case its authorisation has been revoked and a new 
Managing Company has not been designated within a term of four months in 
accordance with paragraph III.3.1. 
The early repayment as a consequence of the occurrence of the above events will be 
implemented as per the terms and conditions established in paragraph III.8.1. 
II.12. 
Table of the financial servicing of the loan, including both the payments of 
interest and the repayment of principal for each one of the Classes of Notes 
of Mortgage Securitisation to be issued by the Fund 
The financial servicing of the Notes shall be provided by Barclays Bank, S.A. as the 
Financial Agent. The payment of interest and repayments of principal shall be 
communicated to the Noteholders as provided for in paragraph III.5.3.a). The 
payment of interest and repayments of principal shall be made to the Noteholders by 
the relevant participant entities and the latter, in turn, shall receive said payments 
from the Sociedad de Gestión de los Sistemas de Registro, Compensación y 
Liquidación de Valores, S.A. (or any other entity that could substitute it in the future), 
as entity in charge of the accounting record as indicated in paragraph II.5. 
a) 
Practical example of the calculation of the Nominal Interest rate 
In accordance with paragraph II.10.3 and in order to make it easier for the 
Noteholder to understand the calculation system used for the Nominal Interest Rate 
and the amount of interest to be received per Class A1 Note on each Payment Date, 
the example given below shows the calculation for this Class.  
¾ 
3 month Euribor Rate: 2.126% 
¾ 
Spread: 0.05% 
¾ 
Amount of interest per Note:  
 
 
 
53 


 
Period of interest for each Note:  
 
90 days 
Unpaid Principal Balance of the Note:   
100,000 Euros 
Calculation of accrued interest per Note: 
100,000 x 2.176% x 90/360 = 544 euros 
The amount of interest to be received for each Class A1 Note would be 546.5 Euros 
on an Unpaid Balance of Principal of the Note of 100,000 Euros. The example would 
be identical for the Class B, C and D Notes, substituting the spread of 0.05% of the 
Class A1 Notes in the example, by the spread of the relevant Class. 
With respect to the first Interest Accrual Period, an example of the calculation of the 
reference interest rate resulting from the interpolation follows: 
¾ 
4 month Euribor:  2.135% 
 
120 days 
¾ 
5 month Euribor:  2.141% 
 
150 days 
150 - 120 = 30 days 
2.141% - 2.135% = 0.006% 
If we divide 0.006% by 30: = 0.0002% 
If we want to calculate the reference interest rate for 125 days (from June 14, 2005 
(Disbursement Date), included, to October 17, 2005 (first Payment Date), excluded): 
(125 - 120) x 0.0002% = 0.001% 
Finally: 
2.135% + 0.001% = 2.136% 
Note that in this example the resulting percentage has been added from the 4 month 
Euribor because the slope of the curve is positive (that is, the 4 month Euribor is 
lower than the 5 month Euribor). 
Once the reference interest rate resulting from the interpolation has been fixed, the 
amount of interest to be received shall be calculated as described above for any 
Interest Accrual Period. 
b) 
Table of the financial service of the loan 
The main characteristic of mortgage securitisation bonds is their periodic repayment. 
As a result, their average life and duration depend fundamentally on the speed at 
which mortgagors repay their loans. 
The anticipated repayments that the debtors decide to make, subject to continuing 
changes and estimated in the Prospectus through the use of the constant annual rate 
 
 
54 


 
of early repayment or future prepayment (hereinafter, "CPR"), will affect the speed of 
repayment of the Participated Mortgage Loans and the average life and duration of 
the Notes directly. 
Other variables exist and are also subject to continuing changes, which affect the 
average life and duration of the Notes. The variables and their hypothetical values 
assumed in all the charts provided in this section are the following: 
¾ 
interest rate of the Mortgage Shares portfolio: 2.743 (average nominal interest rate 
weighted at May 16, 2005);   
¾ 
proportion of the Mortgage Shares portfolio in arrears: 0%;   
¾ 
proportion of the Mortgage Shares portfolio in default: 0%;   
¾ 
rate of early repayment: constant throughout the lifetime of the Notes;   
¾ 
Disbursement Date of the Notes: June 14, 2005; 
¾ 
Amount of Principal Deficiency: none. 
The actual adjusted duration of the Notes shall also depend on their floating interest 
rates, and on all the charts provided in this section the rate is assumed as constant at  
2.176% for the Class A1 Notes, 2.276% for the Class A2 Notes, 2.386% the Class B 
Notes, 2.626% for the Class C Notes and 3.876% for the Class D Notes, except for 
the first Interest Accrual Period, in which the sum of the reference interest rate 
resulting from the interpolation and the relevant spread of each Class results in a rate 
of 2.186% for Class A1 Notes, 2.286 for Class A2 Notes, 2.396% for Class B Notes, 
2.636% for Class C Notes and 3.886% for Class D Notes. 
Assuming that the Fund exercises the early repayment option, set out in the first 
paragraph of paragraph II.11.3.3 (amount of the Mortgage Shares pending repayment 
 
 
55 


 
lower than 10% of its initial amount), the average life and duration of the Notes with 
different CPR set out in the chart below would be the following:

i = Internal rate of return (IRR). 
The Managing Company stated, on behalf of the Fund, that the tables of the financial 
servicing of the loan shown herein are merely theoretical and illustrative, and imply no 
payment obligation whatsoever, noting that: 
¾ 
the CPR are assumed to be constant at 5%, 10% and 15% respectively throughout 
the life of the loan, while the real early repayment changes continuously. 
 
 
56 


 
¾ 
the Unpaid Principal Balance of the Notes on each Payment Date and the interest 
to be paid on each of such dates will depend on the real rate of early repayment 
which may exist in the Mortgage Shares portfolio. 
¾ 
the interest rates of the Notes are assumed to be constant at 2.176% for the Class 
A1 Notes, 2.276% for the Class A2 Notes, 2.386% the Class B Notes, 2.626% for the 
Class C Notes and 3.876% for Class D Notes, except for the first Interest Accrual 
Period, in which the sum of the reference interest rate resulting from the interpolation 
and the relevant spread of each Class results in a rate of 2.186% for the Class A1 
Notes, 2.286% for the Class A2 Notes, 2.396% the Class B Notes, 2.636% for the 
Class C Notes and 3.886% for Class D Notes, while the interest rate of  all Classes will 
be floating during the life of the Notes. 
¾ 
the hypothetical values mentioned at the beginning of this paragraph are assumed 
in all cases. 
¾ 
it is assumed that the Managing Company, on behalf of the Fund, will exercise the 
option of early repayment provided in the first part of paragraph II.11.3.3. 
¾ 
the amounts expressed in the charts are denominated in Euros. It is assumed that 
interest accrued by the Notes is not subject to withholding.

Effective interest estimated for the noteholder, in accordance with the 
characteristics of the issue, specifying the calculation method used and the 
expected expenses by items relevant to their real nature. 
 
II.13.1. Effective interest for the noteholder 
If the annual Nominal Interest Rates applicable to all Classes of Notes, floating 
quarterly, remained constant throughout the life of each Class of Notes at the interest 
rates of 2.176% for the Class A1 Notes, 2.276% for the Class A2 Notes, 2.386% the 
Class B Notes, 2.626% for the Class C Notes and 3.876% for Class D Notes 
(calculations of rates based on the 3 month Euribor fixed and published on May 16, 
2005: 2.126%), except for the first Interest Accrual Period, in which the sum of the 
reference interest rate resulting from the interpolation and the relevant spread of 
each Class results in a rate of 2.186% for the Class A1 Notes, 2.286% for the Class A2 
Notes, 2.396% the Class B Notes, 2.636% for the Class C Notes and 3.886% for Class 
D Notes, such interest rates would represent internal rates of return ("IRR") for the 
Noteholder of 2.226% for the Class A1 Notes, 2.328% for the Class A2 Notes, 2.441% 
the Class B Notes, 2.689% for the Class C Notes and 3.988% for Class D Notes (for a 
CPR of 5%), of 2.227% for the Class A1 Notes, 2.328% for the Class A2 Notes, 
 
 
62 


 
 
 
 
 
2.441% the Class B Notes, 2.689% for the Class C Notes and 3.988% for Class D 
Notes (for a CPR of 10%) and of 2.228% for the Class A1 Notes, 2.328% for the Class 
A2 Notes, 2.442% the Class B Notes, 2.690% for the Class C Notes and 3.988% for 
Class D Notes (for a CPR of 15%), as shown in the chart included in paragraph 
II.12.b), due to the effect produced by the quarterly payment of interest, in all cases 
calculated as internal rate of return without considering the fiscal effect and assuming 
in any case the values and hypothesis shown in the aforementioned paragraph. 
The IRR was calculated by using the following formula: 
Where: 
r = IRR expressed in annual rate. 
 
Ai = Total amounts of repayment and interest which will be received by noteholders.  
(A1......AN) 
 
nd = Number of days elapsed between the Disbursement Date of the issue and January 
15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year, inclusive.

Effective interest estimated for the Fund at the time when the securities are 
issued, taking into account all expenses incurred in design and placement, 
and specifying the method of calculation 
If the Nominal Interest Rate of the Notes remained constant throughout the life of 
each Class of Notes at a rate of 2.176% for the Class A1 Notes, 2.276% for the Class 
A2 Notes, 2.386% the Class B Notes, 2.626% for the Class C Notes and 3.876% for 
Class D Notes , except for the first Interest Accrual Period, in which the sum of the 
reference interest rate resulting from the interpolation and the relevant spread of 
each Class results in a rate of 2.186% for the Class A1 Notes, 2.286% for the Class A2 
Notes, 2.396% the Class B Notes, 2.636% for the Class C Notes and 3.886% for Class 
D Notes, such rates would represent internal rates of return (IRR) of 2.392% for a 5% 
CPR, 2.406% for a 10% CPR and 2.421% for a 15% CPR, calculated and assuming 
the hypothesis mentioned in paragraph II.12.b) as the liquid amount of the issue, 
after deduction of the expenses of the Fund, with the values updated to the  
Incorporation Date of all the payments for interest, repayments and cancellation 
expenses.

There are no special guarantees given in respect of the Mortgage Shares or the Notes, 
except the following undertakings that the Issuer assumes while the Mortgage Shares 
are in force: 
(1) 
to substitute each and all Mortgage Shares derived from Participated 
Mortgage Loans which did not conform, as of the Incorporation Date, to the 
statements contained in paragraph IV.1.a), with other Mortgage Shares with 
homogeneous characteristics of maturity, interest rate, unpaid capital balance and 
credit quality which may be grouped together in a Mortgage Securitisation Fund, in 
accordance with paragraph IV.1.d). If it is not possible, the Issuer undertakes to 
repay the affected Mortgage Shares, reimbursing in cash the unpaid capital balance, 
the unpaid accrued interest, as well as any amount that could be due to the Fund until 
that date, in accordance with paragraph IV.1.d); 
(2) 
likewise, without prejudice to paragraph IV.1.a), the Issuer undertakes that 
if any mortgagor has any credit claim against the Issuer and decides to exercise it by 
setting-off this credit against the debt derived from a Participated Mortgage Loan, the 
Issuer will communicate it to the Managing Company and will pay to the Fund, in the 
bank account that the Managing Company may indicate or open for this purpose, an 
amount equal to the set-off amount which would otherwise have been due to the 
Fund. 
Both (i) the amounts that the Issuer may receive from the mortgagors as principal, 
ordinary interest and arrears interest applicable to each relevant Participated 
Mortgage Loan, and (ii) all the amounts that may be paid to the Issuer as designated 
beneficiary of the insurance policies which have been subscribed by the mortgagors of 
the Participated Mortgage Loans (or any other insurance policy which may grant an 
equivalent cover) and have been assigned by the Issuer to the Fund, will be delivered 
by the Issuer to the Fund through the Managing Company. 
None of the previous undertakings of the Issuer shall be understood as a payment 
guarantee in case of default of the mortgagors. 
II.16. 
Law governing the transfer of the securities, indicating, in particular, any 
restrictions on their free transferability or mentioning that they exist 
The Notes are subject to no particular restriction on their free transferability, which

reasons for choosing them

this purpose, institutional or qualified investors shall be those mentioned in Article 7.1, 
paragraph a) of Royal Decree 291/1992 of March 27, on issues and public offerings

and others described in EU Directive 2003/71/CE. 
II.18.2. Legal suitability of the Notes 
The following legal considerations are applicable to the Notes, for the purposes of 
being subscribed by certain investors: 
(i) 
In accordance with the Ministerial Order of December 30, 1992, on solvency 
regulations of Credit Entities and the Ministerial Order of December 29, 1992, on 
equity and supervision on a consolidated base of securities companies and agencies

66 


 
 
 
t
should maintain, provided that their credit quality, in the opinion of CNMV, is at least, 
the same as that of the underlying mortgage credits. 
The CNMV, on the date of registration of the Prospectus, has granted the weighting 
value mentioned in the preceding paragraph to the Class A1 and Class A2 Notes, as a 
result of the following factors: (i) that the Participated Mortgage Loans have been 
granted with first mortgage guarantee over residential property located in Spain; (ii) 
that the Participated Mortgage Loans and the Mortgage Shares comply with the 
requirements of the regulations in force in the mortgage market; (iii) that the principal 
of each of the Participated Mortgage Loans does not exceed 80% of the appraisal 
value of the corresponding property mortgaged in guarantee; (iv) that the statements 
made by the Issuer provided in the Chapter IV are correct; and (v) that the ratings 
granted by the Rating Agencies, as an assessment of the financial risk of the Notes 
are as provided in paragraph II.3. 
The Class B, the Class C and the Class D Notes do not have the 50% weighting value 
for the solvency ratio of Credit Entities and securities companies and agencies referred 
to in the above mentioned regulations. 
(ii) 
The Notes are eligible for investment by Insurance Entities and their 
technical provisions, in accordance with Article 50.5 of the Regulation on Ordination 
and Supervision of the Private Insurance, approved by Royal Decree 2486/1998, of 
November 20, as amended by Royal Decree 297/2004, of February 20, among others.

accordance with the common rules established in Article 23 and with the particular 
rules established for each one of them in Articles 30 (Financial Collective Investment

regulations come into force and provided that they do not oppose the said Law, in 
accordance with Royal Decree 1393/1990, of November 2, as amended by Royal 
Decree 91/2001, of February 2, among others, and with the Order of May 28, 1999 
which partially amends the Order of June 7, 1990, on Collaboration Agreements

The Underwriting Entities will receive an underwriting fee of 0.10% over the total 
nominal amount of Notes effectively underwritten by that entity by virtue of the 
Underwriting Agreement referred in paragraph V.4.2. The payment of this fee will be 
charged to the Fund on the Disbursement Date by means of the deduction of the 
payable fee from the amount effectively underwritten that the relevant Underwriting 
Entity will pay to the Financial Agent in the account opened with the Bank of Spain in 
the name of Barclays Bank, S.A., as provided in the Underwriting Agreement. 
The underwriting commitment contained herein is provisional and subject to the 
Managing Company, the Entidad Directora and the Underwriting Entities reaching an 
agreement on the final spreads applicable to all Classes of Notes before the 
commencement of the Subscription Period. If an agreement is not reached (or in the 
event that the Underwriting Entities invoke any of the conditions for termination 
established below), the Underwriting Entities which do not accept the final spreads (or 
who have invoked any of the conditions for termination established below) shall be 
free from their commitments and the Managing Company will be entitled to determine 
the final spreads on its own. In this case, Barclays Bank, S.A. undertakes to fully 
assume the underwriting commitments of those Underwriting Entities which do not 
accept the final spreads or who have invoked any of the conditions for termination 
established below and will be entitled to receive in turn an underwriting fee of 0.10% 
over the total nominal amount of Notes underwritten by it. In this case, the Managing 
Company shall communicate to the CNMV that Barclays Bank, S.A. will finally act as 
Underwriting Entity by virtue of this underwriting commitment. 
The Underwriting Agreement includes conditions for termination which may be 
invoked by the Underwriting Entities and that would imply the undertaking by Barclays 
Bank, S.A. of underwriting commitments. Those conditions refer, in addition to the 
above referred disagreement on the final spreads, to the following matters: (i) there 
having been no material adverse change or development involving a prospective 
material adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Fund, the 
Participated Mortgage Loans or the Mortgage Shares since the date of execution of 
the Underwriting Agreement, and no event making some of the representations and 
 
 
70 


 
warranties contained therein untrue or incorrect in any material respect on the 
Disbursement Date, and (ii) if, in the opinion of Barclays Bank PLC, acting through its 
investment banking division Barclays Capital, on behalf of all the Underwriting Entities, 
there shall have been such a change in national or international financial, political or 
economic conditions or currency exchange rates or exchange controls as would be 
likely to prejudice materially the success of the offering and distribution of the Notes 
or dealings in the Notes in the secondary market. 
II.19.2. Arranger of the Issue

omit data or significant facts that could be relevant for the investor." 
Barclays Bank, S.A., as Entidad Directora, will receive an arrangement fee of 0.01% 
on the total nominal amount of all Classes of Notes. The payment of this fee will be 
charged to the Fund on the Disbursement Date, and will be deducted from full 
amount received from the Underwriting Entities which the Financial Agent will pay to 
the Fund in the Cash Account.

of their relation or Underwriting Agreement, guarantees required from the 
issuer or offeror, types of risks assumed, type of compensation which the

an underwriting agreement of the placement of the Notes with the Underwriting 
Entities (the “Underwriting Agreement”), whereby the Underwriting Entities will 
freely assign the Notes to third parties in the amounts set out for each one, and once

most relevant information on the same and does not omit any information which may 
affect the contents of this Prospectus. 
The Underwriting Entities assume the obligations provided in the Underwriting 
Agreement, which are basically as follows: 1) undertaking to subscribe for the Notes 
which have not been subscribed once the Subscription Period is closed, up to the 
amounts set out for each of them; 2) payment into the bank account opened by the 
Financial Agent (Barclays Bank, S.A.) at the Bank of Spain, of the underwriting 
commitment by each Underwriting Entity, for same-day value, before 11:00 hours 
a.m. (Madrid time) on the Disbursement Date, after deduction of the agreed 
underwriting fee; and 3) delivery of a subscription supporting document to 
subscribers.  
In accordance with paragraph II.19.1 above, the underwriting commitments are 
subject to the Managing Company, the Entidad Directora and the Underwriting Entities 
reaching an agreement on the final spreads applicable to all Classes of Notes before 
the commencement of the Subscription Period. If an agreement is not reached (or in 
the event that the Underwriting Entities invoke any of the conditions for termination of 
the Underwriting Agreement established therein -vid. paragraph II.19.1-), the 
Underwriting Entities which do not accept the final spreads (or who have invoked any 
of the conditions for termination established in the Underwriting Agreement) shall be 
free from their commitments and the Managing Company will be entitled to determine 
the final spreads on its own. In this case, Barclays Bank, S.A. undertakes to fully

Spanish legislation under which the securities are created and indication of 
the competent court should there be any litigation 
The incorporation of the Fund and the issue of the Notes are subject to the Spanish 
legislation in accordance with the provisions set forth in Law 19/1992, of July 7, on 
Regime applicable to Companies and Funds of Real Estate Investment and Funds of 
Mortgage Securitisation; Law 24/1988, dated July 28 on Securities Market, amended 
by Law 37/1998, dated November 16, Law 44/2002 dated November 22, and Royal 
Decree Law 5/2005, among others; and in accordance with the provisions set forth in 
Royal Decree 291/1992, dated March 27, on Issues and Public Offerings of Sale of 
Securities, amended by Royal Decree 2590/1998 dated December 7, on amendment 
of the legal regime of the securities markets; as well as in the Order of July 12, 1993 
on Information Prospectus and other developments of Royal Decree 291/1992 of 
March 27, and the CNMV Circular 2/1994 of March 16 and the CNMV Circular 2/1999 
of April 22, whereby certain pro-forma prospectuses to be used in issues or public 
offerings of securities were approved. 
The Underwriting Agreement is subject to English law. The underwriting subject to 
conditions precedent and arrangement agreement by virtue of which Barclays Bank, 
S.A. would act as Underwriting Entity in the circumstances described in paragraph 
II.19.1 and, regardless of the occurrence of such circumstances, as Entidad Directora, 
will be subject to Spanish law. 
All matters, discrepancies, disputes and claims which may derive from the 
incorporation, management and legal representation by the Managing Company of the 
Fund and the Notes, will be exclusively submitted to and settled by the Courts and 
Tribunals of the City of Madrid, Spain. 
The Incorporation Deed will be governed by and construed in accordance with 
Spanish law. 
II.22. 
Taxation of income derived from the Notes 
The following is a summary of the tax regime applicable to the investments derived 
from the offer. This summary is based on laws which are currently in force in Spain.  
 
73 


 
Investors must take into account both their particular tax circumstances and the rules 
of territorial application and the legislation in force at the time the income is obtained. 
Since the Notes are registered in book-entry form and a request will be made for their 
listing in a Spanish official secondary market, and considering that such circumstances 
are significant when determining the taxes to be paid, it has been assumed that both 
conditions will be complied with. Likewise, it has been considered that the Notes will 
be regarded, at the time of their issuance, as financial assets with an explicit return 
whenever such circumstance may prove significant for taxation purposes. 
Any withholdings, payments on account and taxes already established or which may 
be established in the future on the principal, interest or earnings of the Notes will be 
borne by their holders and their amount will be deducted by the Managing Company, 
if applicable, following the procedures established by law. 
Throughout the life of the Notes, the Fund will be subject to tax in accordance with 
the legislation currently in force at the time. 
This summary does not address all the tax considerations that may be relevant to all 
categories of potential investors, some of whom (such as financial institutions, collective 
investment institutions or “look-through” entities) may be subject to special rules.  
II.22.1. Spanish resident investors 
a) 
Individual Income Tax 
Interest and income arising from the transfer, reimbursement or redemption of the 
Notes obtained by Noteholders who may be regarded as taxpayers under the 
Individual Income Tax (IIT), will be deemed income from movable property in 
accordance with the terms provided for in Article 23.2 of Royal Legislative Decree 
3/2004 of March 5 on Individual Income Tax. 
In this regard, income derived from the coupon payments will be equal to the gross 
amount of the coupon, including the amount withheld, if any, in accordance with the 
IIT Regulations. 
In the event of transfer, reimbursement or redemption of the Notes, income will be 
equal to the difference between their transfer, reimbursement or redemption value 
(deducting the additional expenses incurred in the transfer, provided they are duly 
justified) and their acquisition or subscription value (adding the additional expenses 
incurred in the acquisition, provided they are duly justified). 
Losses derived from the transfer of the Notes, when the taxpayer had acquired other 
Notes within the two months prior or subsequent to such transfer, shall be included in 
its taxable base when the remaining Notes are transferred. 
The resulting net taxable income shall be determined by deducting the management 
and deposit expenses from the gross income, excluding those pertaining to 
discretionary and individualized portfolio management. If the income was generated 
 
 
74 


 
after a two-year holding period, the individual taxpayer will benefit from a 40% 
reduction on the taxable income. 
Interest received by the Noteholders will be subject to a withholding tax on account of 
the investor’s final IIT liability (currently, at a 15% rate), in accordance with the 
provisions set forth in Royal Decree 1775/2004 of July 30, on IIT Regulations.  
On the contrary, income arising on the transfer or reimbursement of the Notes will not 
be subject to withholding tax at source, given that the Notes (i) will be registered in 
book-entry form and (ii) listed in a Spanish official secondary market. 
Notwithstanding the above, a withholding tax will be applied on the part of the price 
corresponding to the accrued interest (currently, at a 15% rate) when the transfer of 
the Notes takes place within the thirty (30) days period prior to the moment in which 
such interest is due, provided that (i) the acquiror is a person or entity that is not 
resident in Spain for tax purposes or is a taxpayer under the Corporate Income Tax 
Law, and (ii) the acquiror is not subject to withholding tax at source on interest 
arising from the acquired Notes. 
b) 
Corporate Income Tax 
Interest and income arising on the transfer, redemption or reimbursement of the 
Notes, obtained by entities that are resident in Spain for tax purposes will be taxed 
under the rules contained in Section IV of Royal Legislative Decree 4/2004 of March 5 
on Corporate Income Tax (CIT). 
Said income will not be subject to any withholding tax at source due to the fact that 
the Notes (i) will be registered in book-entry form and (ii) listed in a Spanish official 
secondary market. 
Pursuant to article 59.q) of Royal Decree 1777/2004 of July 30, said income will not 
be subject to any withholding tax at source provided that the Notes (i) will be 
registered in book-entry form and (ii) listed in a Spanish official secondary market. 
In this regard, pursuant to Order of December 22, 1999, the procedure to apply such 
withholding tax exemption with regard to interest paid to taxpayers shall be carried 
out as follows: 
1. The Managing Company, in the name and on behalf of the Fund as issuer, shall pay 
to the depositary entities, through the Financial Agent, the net amount resulting 
from the application of the general withholding rate in force (currently, 15%) to the 
gross amount of interest. 
 
2. Before the 10th day following the end of the month following that month in which 
each interest coupon was due, the depositary entities shall submit to the Managing 
Company or the Financial Agent a list of CIT taxpayers including their identity, the 
 
 
75 


 
ISIN code of the Notes, the number of Notes owned by each investor on the 
maturity date of each coupon, the gross income obtained and the amount withheld. 
 
3. The Noteholders, CIT taxpayers, shall provide evidence of ownership of the Notes to 
the depositary entities before the 10th day following the end of the month in which 
the interest coupon was due, so that the depositary entities may produce the list 
referred to in paragraph 2 above. 
 
4. As soon as it receives the referred list, the Managing Company shall immediately 
pay, through the Financial Agent, to the depositary entities the amount withheld 
from those investors that are CIT taxpayers. 
 
5. The depositary entities shall immediately pay the amount withheld to those 
Noteholders regarded as CIT taxpayers. 
In order to evidence their status as CIT taxpayers, the Noteholders may use any 
means of proof available under the law. In this regard, documents provided as 
evidence must be in possession of the depositary entity of the Notes and at the 
Issuer's disposal (the Managing Company representing the Fund) for verification 
purposes. The State Treasury must also be allowed access to this information. A 
photocopy of the Tax Identification Number will be sufficient for this purpose. 
II.22.2. Non-Spanish resident investors 
Interest and other income arising from the transfer, reimbursement or redemption of 
the Notes obtained by Noteholders that are not resident in Spain for tax purposes, 
either through a permanent establishment located in Spain or otherwise, will be 
considered Spanish sourced income and, therefore, subject to taxation in Spain under 
the terms of Article 12 of Royal Legislative Decree 5/2004 of March 5, on Non-
Residents Income Tax (NRIT). 
a) 
Income obtained through a permanent establishment located in Spain 
Income deriving from the Notes obtained through a permanent establishment in Spain 
will be taxed in accordance with the rules provided by Chapter III of the 
aforementioned Royal Legislative Decree 5/2004, of March 5, notwithstanding the 
applicable Conventions for the avoidance of  Double Taxation entered into by Spain. 
The withholding rules applicable to CIT taxpayers will be applicable to NRIT taxpayers 
who obtain income through a permanent establishment in Spain. 
Thus, such income will not be subject to withholding tax at source given that the 
Notes will be registered in book-entry form and listed in a Spanish official secondary 
market. 
The procedure to apply this withholding tax exemption with respect to interest 
payments is established by the Order of December 22, 1999. 
 
 
76 


 
b) 
Income not obtained through a permanent establishment located in Spain 
Interest as well as income arising from the transfer, reimbursement or redemption of 
the Notes obtained by individuals and entities non-resident in Spain for tax purposes 
and not acting in Spain with respect to the Notes through a permanent establishment 
located in Spain will be subject to tax in accordance with the rules set forth in Chapter 
IV of the aforementioned Royal Legislative Decree 5/2005, of March 5. The following 
is a summary of these rules, without prejudice to the provisions established by the 
Conventions for the avoidance of  Double Taxation (CDT) entered into by Spain that 
may determine exemption from the relevant income or, as the case may be, 
application of reduced tax rates: 
¾ The taxable base will be equal to the gross amount obtained, calculated in 
accordance with the rules set forth in Individual Income Tax Law, without applying 
the reductions provided under the said Law. 
¾ In the event of transfer, reimbursement or redemption of the Notes, the taxable 
income will be calculated taking into account the additional expenses incurred in the 
acquisition and transfer of such Notes, provided that they are appropriately 
evidenced. Taxpayers will be taxed separately for each total or partial accrual of 
income subject to taxation, without the possibility of setting off such accruals 
against each other. 
¾ Income obtained from the Notes by individuals or entities non-resident in Spain and 
that do not act through a permanent establishment located in Spain will be exempt 
from taxation in Spain when obtained by residents in another EU Member State or 
by a permanent establishment of the said residents in another EU Member State, 
provided that the relevant certificate of residence issued by the tax authorities of the 
country in which the investor resides is furnished. Said certificate will be valid for a 
term of one year from the date of issuance. 
¾ Likewise, income deriving from the transfer of these securities in a Spanish official 
secondary market will be exempt, if obtained by individuals or entities that are 
residents of a State that has entered into a CDT with Spain that includes an 
exchange of information. For this purpose, a certificate of tax residence issued by 
the tax authorities of the country in which the investor resides must be furnished 
(expressly stating that the investor is resident within the meaning of the relevant 
CDT), or, where appropriate, a specific form provided in the Order Regulation which 
further regulates the relevant CDT. Said certificate will be valid for a term of one 
year from the date of issuance. 
¾ The exemptions described in the preceding paragraphs shall in no event be 
applicable when the income is obtained through countries or territories regarded as 
tax havens, as provided in Royal Decree 1080/1991, of July 5. 
 
 
77 


 
¾ The tax quota will be calculated by applying the tax rate of 15% to the above 
taxable base, unless an internal exemption or a reduced tax rate provided by a CDT 
is applicable. In the latter event, the application of the reduced tax rate established 
in the CDT will require the submission of a certificate of tax residence in the terms 
established above. Such certificate must expressly state that the investor is resident 
within the meaning of the relevant CDT. 
¾ Income obtained by the non-Spanish resident Noteholders may be subject to 
withholding on account of NRIT, according to the following rules: 
¾ The payment of interest on the Notes will be subject to withholding tax on 
account of NRIT, except for the cases where the payment of the tax or the 
applicability of an exemption is evidenced. The withholding, if applicable, will be 
equal to the final tax quota, calculated according to the rules described above. 
¾ However, no withholding tax will be due on income deriving from the transfer or 
reimbursement of the Notes, since they will be registered in book-entry form and 
listed in a Spanish official secondary market. 
¾ In such cases in which financial entities domiciled, resident or represented in 
Spain take part in the payment procedure of the interest derived from the Notes 
as depositary or collection manager of the income derived from such securities, 
the withholding procedure shall be carried out in accordance with the procedure 
established by the Order of April 13, 2000, as follows: 
1. 
The Fund shall transfer to the depositary entities, directly or through its 
Financial Agent, on each coupon payment date, the net amount resulting 
from the application of the general withholding general rate in force on such 
date (currently, 15%) to the gross amount of interest.  
2. 
The depositary entities shall submit to the Managing Company or the 
Financial Agent, before the 10th day following the end of the month in which 
the interest coupon was due, a list of the non-Spanish resident Noteholders, 
including information relating to the class and maturity date of the Notes, 
identification and residence of the Noteholders, the number of Notes held by 
each investor on the maturity date of each coupon, the relevant gross 
income obtained and the amount to be withheld.  
3. 
Non-Spanish residents shall, on their part, have evidenced before the 
depositary entities their residence for tax purposes by means of a certificate 
of residence issued by the tax authorities of their country of residence, 
where it must be expressly stated, in the event that a withholding exemption 
or a reduced tax rate applies in accordance with a CDT, that such investor is 
resident in such country within the meaning of the relevant CDT. This 
certificate is valid for a period of one (1) year as of the date of issuance. 
Nevertheless, if a reduced tax rate provided by a CDT is applicable and such 
 
 
78 


 
CDT has been developed through and Order that requires the use of a 
specific form, the tax residence shall be evidenced through the filing of such 
form. 
4. 
The Fund, as soon as it receives the list referred to in the preceding 
paragraph, shall immediately transfer, directly or through its Financial Agent, 
to the depositary entities the amount withheld from the investors who are 
entitled to apply the withholding exemption or the amount withheld in 
excess of the reduced tax rate provided by the relevant CDT. 
5. 
The depositary entities shall immediately pay to the investors on account of 
the Fund, the amount withheld or, as the case may be, the amount withheld 
in excess of the CDT reduced rate. 
In the event that the Noteholder could not properly evidence its tax residence for 
this purpose, income derived from the Notes shall be subject to the general 
taxation regime explained above. However, the affected investors may request a 
refund of the amount withheld from the Spanish Tax Authorities following the 
standard refund procedure set forth by the Spanish regulations. 
II.22.3. Indirect taxation on the subscription, acquisition and transfer of the Notes 
Subscription, acquisition and transfer of the Notes will be exempt from Transfer Tax 
and Value Added Tax. Additionally, no Stamp Duty will be levied on such transfers. 
II.22.4. Net Wealth Tax 
Spanish resident individuals who hold Notes on the last day of any year and who must  
file the corresponding return, will be subject to the general rules of the Spanish Net 
Wealth Tax on the average market value of such Notes during the last quarter of such 
year, published on an annual basis by the Spanish Ministerial Department of Economy 
and Finance. 
Non-Spanish resident individuals who hold Notes on the last day of each year will also 
be subject to the Net Wealth Tax, unless an applicable CDT entered into by Spain 
states otherwise. However, Noteholders that are resident in an EU Member State will 
be exempted with regard to the Notes whose income is exempt from NRIT in the 
terms set forth above. 
II.22.5. Inheritance and Gift Tax 
Transfers of the Notes upon death or by gift (inter vivos) in favour of individuals will be 
subject to the general rules of the Spanish Inheritance and Gift Tax, unless an 
applicable CDT states otherwise. For the cases in which the beneficiary is a corporation, 
the income obtained will be subject to CIT or NRIT, as the case may be, without 
prejudice to the provisions of the CDT that may be applicable. 
 
 
79 


 
II.23.

II.23.1. Allocation of the net amount of the issue 
The net proceeds of the issue of the Notes will be allocated entirely for the payment 
of the price for the acquisition of the Mortgage Shares issued by the Issuer.

Management and representation of the Fund and of the holders of the 
securities issued by the Fund 
III.3.1. Description of the duties and responsibilities assumed by the Managing 
Company in the management and legal representation of the Fund and of 
the holders of the securities issued by the Fund 
 
In accordance with Article 5.2 of Law 19/1992, the management and legal 
representation of the Fund corresponds to the Managing Company, in the terms set 
out in Law 19/1992 and other applicable regulations, without prejudice to that set out 
in the Incorporation Deed. The incorporation of the Managing Company was 
authorised by the Ministry of Economy and Tax on July 16, 1993 and it is registered 
with the Special Registries of CNMV under number 5. The information on the 
Managing Company is provided in Chapter VI of this Prospectus. 
 
The resignation and substitution of the Managing Company will be governed by 
Articles 18 and 19 of Royal Decree 926/1998, of May 14, on regulation of Asset 
Securitisation Funds and on Securitisation Funds Managing Companies or by the laws 
in force at any time. The Managing Company will be entitled to request its substitution

CNMV, in which the appointment of the replacement managing company will be 
included. A written communication by the new managing company of securitisation 
funds, duly authorized and registered with the Special Registries of the CNMV will also 
be attached. In this communication, the replacing managing company will declare that 
it is willing to accept such function. The resignation of the Managing Company and the 
appointment of a new managing company must be approved by the CNMV. The 
Managing Company will not be entitled to discontinue its duties until all the 
requirements and steps for the appointment of the substituting managing company 
have been completed. All the expenses that may be generated as a consequence of 
this substitution will be borne by the Managing Company and under no circumstance 
shall they be charged to the Fund. 
If the Managing Company was declared in liquidation or insolvency (“concurso”) or if 
its authorisation is revoked, it shall find a Managing Company to replace it, and the 
management and representation of the Fund will be carried out by the new managing 
company, in compliance with Articles 18 and 19 of the Royal Decree 926/1998 of May 
14 referred to. 
If after four (4) months (such period being established in Article 19.2 of the 
mentioned Royal Decree) after the event giving rise to the replacement occurred, a 
new managing company has not been appointed, an event of early termination of the 
 
 
84 


 
Fund and repayment of the Notes will exist and the actions set out in paragraph III.8 
will be carried out. 
The replacement of the Managing Company and the appointment of the new 
managing company, once approved by the CNMV, will be communicated to the Rating 
Agencies. 
The Noteholders will not take any action against the Managing Company for any 
reason other than the breach of its duties or for the non-compliance with the 
provisions of the Incorporation Deed. 
Particularly, the Managing Company, in its management duties, will carry out the 
following activities: 
(i) 
It will open, on behalf of the Fund, a bank account (hereinafter, the “Cash 
Account” referred to in paragraph V.3.1) with the Financial Agent and, as the case 
may be, the Excess Balance Account. 
The balance of this account will accrue interest at a monthly average of EONIA 
interest rate (Euro Overnight Interest Average) calculated by the European Central 
Bank and published by REUTERS in its page EONIA, corresponding to the previous 
month. This interest will be settled monthly. 
(ii) 
It will adopt the appropriate measures in order that the amounts received in 
respect of principal and interest and for any other respect that are due to the Fund, 
are deposited in the Cash Account. 
(iii) 
It will ensure that the amounts deposited in the Cash Account earn the 
profitability set forth in the Financial Services Agreement and that the amounts 
deposited, as the case may be, in the Excess Balance Account earn the profitability 
arranged for such balance.  
(iv) 
It will calculate, on each Interest Rate Fixing Date, with regard to the next 
Interest Accrual Period, the Nominal Interest Rate applicable to all Classes of Notes 
resulting from the calculation made according with paragraph II.10, and will publish it 
as set forth in paragraph III.5.3.a). 
(v) 
It will calculate, on each Calculation Date, the principal to be repaid for all 
Classes of Notes, and together with the accrued interest in accordance with paragraph 
II.11.3.2, it will publish them as set forth in paragraph III.5.3.a). 
(vi) 
It will allocate the Available Funds (referred in paragraph V.5.1.B), as well as 
any other amount available in the Cash Account and, as the case may be, in the 
Excess Balance Account, on each date, to the fulfilment of the payment or withholding 
obligations of the Fund in the terms and in the payment priority order provided for 
paragraph V.5.1.B)2 and the exceptional rules provided in paragraph V.5.2. or in the 
 
 
85 


 
payment priority order in the event of liquidation of the Fund contained in paragraph 
V.6.1. and the exceptional rules established in paragraph V.6.2. 
If, at any time during the life of the Fund, the ratings of Barclays Bank PLC or its stake 
in Barclays Bank, S.A. fall below the thresholds indicated in paragraph II.4.1 above, 
Barclays Bank, S.A. will be substituted as Financial Agent by another credit entity 
whose short-term debt has a rating of at least A-1 in accordance with S&P short term 
risk scale, P-1 in accordance with Moody’s short term risk scale and F1 in accordance 
with Fitch short term risk scale (in which case, the Managing Company will transfer to 
this entity the Cash Account and will arrange for the best obtainable return of its 
balances), unless the Financial Agent (i) obtains from a credit entity with the 
mentioned minimum ratings, within thirty (30) Business Days from the assignment of 
this lower rating or from the reduction of Barclays Bank PLC’s holding in the Financial 
Agent below the above mentioned percentage, a first demand guarantee that 
guarantees to the Fund the amounts deposited in the Cash Account, or (ii) transfer 
the Cash Account of the Fund to an entity with a non-subordinated and unsecured 
short-term debt of at least A-1, P-1 and F1 ratings (in accordance with S&P, Moody’s 
and Fitch short-term debt rating scales, respectively), arranging for the best 
obtainable return of the balances of the Cash Account, or (iii) if options a) and b) 
above are not possible, the Managing Company obtains from the Financial Agent or a 
third party collateral security in favour of the Fund on financial assets with a credit 
rating of not less than that of the Spanish State Government Debt (“Deuda Pública del 
Estado Español”) in an amount sufficient to guarantee the commitments established in 
the Financial Services Agreement. In event (ii) above, the Managing Company will 
subsequently transfer the balances of the Cash Account back to the Financial Agent, 
provided that the non-subordinated and unsecured short-term debt of Barclays Bank 
PLC is assigned the aforementioned A-1, P-1 and F1 ratings and the stake held by 
Barclays Bank PLC in the Financial Agent is equal or higher than 51%. The 
substitution of the Financial Agent will in no event negatively affect the ratings of the 
Notes. Likewise, in the event that the credit rating of the non-subordinated and 
unsecured short-term debt of Barclays Bank PLC falls to A-1 (according to the rating 
scales for short-term risks of S&P), if the balance of the Cash Account exceeds 20% of 
the Unpaid Principal Balance of the Notes on a given Payment Date, the Managing 
Company will deposit the difference on the Excess Balance Account opened by the 
Managing Company in another credit entity whose short-term debt is assigned a 
minimum rating of A-1+ (in accordance the aforementioned rating scale), agreeing for 
the best obtainable return of such balance. Similarly, in the event that the non-
subordinated and unsecured short-term debt of Barclays Bank PLC attains again the 
A-1+ rating (in accordance with S&P short-term debt rating scale), the Managing 
Company will subsequently transfer to the Cash Account opened with the Financial 
Agent the then balance of the Excess Balance Account.  
(viii) 
It shall appoint the auditors of the Fund. 
 
 
86 


 
(ix) 
It shall manage the Fund with the objective of maintaining the net value of 
the Fund at zero at all times. 
(x) 
In accordance with the Prospectus and the Incorporation Deed, it shall 
adopt the appropriate resolutions with regard to the liquidation of the Fund, including 
the resolution for the early liquidation of the Fund. 
(xi) 
It shall perform its activity due diligently, as prescribed by Royal Decree 
926/1998, of May 14, representing the Fund and defending the interests of the 
holders of the Notes and of the Fund’s other ordinary creditors as if they were its own 
interests, stepping up the standards of diligence, reporting and defence of their 
interests and avoiding situations which might result in conflicts of interest, giving the 
interests of the holders of the Notes and all other ordinary creditors of the Fund 
priority over third-party and its own interests. In this regard, and without prejudice to

III.3.2. Remuneration of the Managing Company for performing its duties 
The Managing Company, in accordance with Law 19/1992, will incorporate, represent 
and manage the Fund. For these duties, the Fund will pay the Managing Company a 
Management Fee which includes an Initial Fee and a Periodic Fee. 
The Incorporation Deed will provide that the Managing Company will be entitled to an 
Initial Management Fee payable on the Disbursement Date in one lump sum 
amounting to 90,000 euros. 
The Incorporation Deed will also provide that the Managing Company will be entitled 
on each Payment Date to a Management Periodic Fee of an annual 0.02% of the sum 
of the amount of Mortgage Shares pending repayment on the previous Calculation 
Date, subject to a minimum amount of 30,050 euros and a maximum amount of 
150,000 euros per year. 
The calculation of the fee that will be paid on a given Payment Date, will be made by 
means of the following formula: 
C = B x 0.02% x d/365 
Being: 
C = Fee payable on a given Payment Date.   
B = Principal Balance of the amount of Mortgage Shares pending repayment on the 
previous Calculation Date.   
d = Number of days elapsed during the relevant accrual period (except for the first 
accrual period, where the days elapsed from the Incorporation Date until the first 
Payment Date will be considered). 
If during the life of the Fund, the Consumer Price Index published by the National 
Institute of Statistics corresponding to every calendar year rises, the annual minimum 
amount shall be adjusted cumulatively in the same proportion (the adjustment of the 
minimum amount being made according to the variation experienced by the 
Consumer Price Index of the previous year), starting from the year 2006 inclusive and 
effective from January 1 of every year. 
The fees referred to in the previous paragraphs are ranked first (1st) in the payment 
priority order established in paragraph V.5.1.B)2 and the exceptional rules set out in 
paragraph V.5.2. and are ranked first (1st) in the payment priority order in the event 
 
 
88 


 
of liquidation of the Fund contained in paragraph V.6.1. and the exceptional rules 
established in paragraph V.6.2. 
If, on a Payment Date, the Fund should not have enough liquidity to satisfy the 
Management Periodic Fee, the amount due will accrue interest equal to the addition of 
(i) the reference interest rate of the Notes (3 Month-EURIBOR calculated in 
accordance with paragraph II.10 of this Prospectus or the reference interest rate 
resulting from the interpolation provided for the first Interest Accrual Period) 
applicable in the relevant period and (ii) the final spread of Class D Notes payable on 
the following Payment Date, provided that the Fund has enough liquidity, in 
accordance with the payment priority order established in paragraph V.5.1.B)2 and 
the exceptional rules set out in paragraph V.5.2. and the payment priority order in the 
event of liquidation of the Fund contained in paragraph V.6.1. and the exceptional 
rules established in paragraph V.6.2. 
All payments to third parties in respect of ordinary expenses (such as annual audits of 
the Fund, publications and other) and extraordinary expenses related to the 
management of the Fund, will be satisfied by the Managing Company, in the name 
and on behalf of the Fund, represented by the Managing Company, whenever the 
Fund has enough liquidity for it, in accordance with the payment ranking established

unpaid interest until the early repayment date, reduced, as the case may be, by 
the relevant withholding tax; all these amounts will be considered on that date and

entities. As from the date the Managing Company notifies the conditions under

payment delays for a term not greater than two (2) years. To establish the 
market value, the Managing Company may be entitled to obtain the reports that 
it may find appropriate. The Issuer will have a pre-emptive right, in such a way 
that it may acquire the said assets that belong to the Fund before any third 
party. The Managing Company, in the name and on behalf of the Fund, shall 
send to the Issuer a list of the assets and offers received from third parties, and 
the Issuer will be able to make use of the aforementioned right regarding all the 
assets offered by the Managing Company within the thirty (30) days following the 
 
 
100 


 
receipt of the communication and whenever its offers are equivalent, at least, to 
the best third party offer. 
The Managing Company, once the reserve referred in paragraph III.8.2 has been 
accounted for, shall allocate all the amounts obtained from the transfer of assets 
which belong to the Fund to the payment of the different items, in the manner,

of the Fund, such as a new legal regime or additional legal regulations, 
withholdings or other situations that could affect this balance permanently 
(paragraph II.11.3.3); 
(v) in the event that a relevant breach of payment exists or it is foreseen that there 
will be one, and such breach produces a significant permanent unbalance related 
to any of the Notes issued (paragraph II.11.3.3); 
(vi)  in the case of full repayment of the Notes (no later than the Final Maturity Date)

exceptional rules set out in  paragraph V.6.2, there are any amounts remaining, they 
shall be paid to the Issuer. In the event that the remaining amount was not liquid

proceedings initiated as a consequence of the default of the debtor in the payment of 
the Participated Mortgage Loan, in accordance with paragraph IV.2.11, both its 
continuance, and the result of the court decision will be in favour of the Issuer.

deed that will be sent to the CNMV and the Rating Agencies, declaring: (i) the 
extinguishment of the Fund and the reasons that gave rise to it; (ii) the procedure 
used to inform the Noteholders and the CNMV; and (iii) the distribution of the 
Available Funds following the payment priority order in the event of liquidation of the 
Fund established in paragraph V.6.1. and the exceptional rules set out in paragraph 
V.6.2. The Managing Company will publish said statements in a newspaper of national

25, Royal Decree 685/1982, of March 17 as amended by Royal Decree 1289/1991, of 
August 2, so that the Managing Company groups them in the Fund in accordance with 
Law 19/1992 and other applicable regulations. Given the corporate investor nature of 
the Fund, the issue of the Mortgage Shares will not be recorded with a marginal note 
in each recording of the mortgages with the Land Registry. 
The total face value of the Mortgage Shares issue will be at least equal to the initial 
total nominal amount of the Notes issued. Each Mortgage Share represents 100% of 
the principal and of the interest pending amortisation and payment, respectively, as 
well as of the arrears interest of each one of the Participated Mortgage Loans to which 
it corresponds, all in accordance with paragraph IV.1.c). 
The Participated Mortgage Loans are part of a selection of mortgage loans whose

b)

Incorporation Date will have a total capital value at least equal to the total nominal 
amount of the Notes, that is, Euro 700,000,000.   
The issue price of the Mortgage Shares will be the par value. The price that the Fund

sum of the nominal amount of each Mortgage Share. 
The payment of the issue price of the Mortgage Shares will be made on the 
Disbursement Date of the Notes (referred in paragraph II.18.5) together with the 
accrued interest at the reference interest rate applicable to the first Interest Accrual 
Period between the date of granting of the Incorporation Deed (included) and the

Additionally, the Issuer will be entitled to receive an amount equal to the ordinary 
interest accrued by the Participated Mortgage Loans from the last date of settlement 
of interest of each one of them until the Incorporation Date and to the arrears interest 
which the Participated Mortgage Loans may have accrued from the relevant non-
payment date until the Incorporation Date (the “Accrued Interest”) that will be

c) 
Rights of Mortgage Share holders over the loans that guarantee said 
Mortgage Shares 
The Mortgage Shares refer to a participation of 100% in the principal and in the 
interest, (including ordinary and arrears interest), of each Participated Mortgage Loan. 
The Issuer, in accordance with Article 5.8 of Law 19/1992, is not subject to the risk of 
default in payment of the Mortgage Shares and, therefore, does not assume any 
liability for the default of the mortgagors, either of principal, of interest or of any 
other amount that they could owe by virtue of the Participated Mortgage Loans. The 
participation in the Participated Mortgage Loans will be for the remaining term until 
the final maturity of the Participated Mortgage Loans. The Issuer will assume no 
responsibility in warranting directly or indirectly the appropriate completion of the 
transaction, neither shall it grant guarantees or backings, or enter into repurchasing 
agreements of the Mortgage Shares, except as provided in paragraph IV.1.d) and 
IV.1.e). 
 
 
107 


 
The Mortgage Shares confer the following rights in relation to the Participated 
Mortgage Loans: 
a) 
to receive all amounts accrued for the repayment of the principal of the 
Participated Mortgage Loans; 
b) 
to receive all amounts accrued for the ordinary interest of the Participated 
Mortgage Loans; 
c) 
to receive all amounts accrued for arrears interest of the Participated Mortgage 
Loans; 
d) 
to receive any other amounts, assets or rights in payment of principal, interest or 
expenses of the Participated Mortgage Loans, both for the auction price or the 
amount determined by a judicial decision or notarial procedure when enforcing 
the mortgage guarantees, for the transfer or operation of the assigned properties 
or as a consequence of the mentioned enforcements, in management and interim 
possession of the properties in an enforcement procedure; and 
e) 
to receive all possible rights or compensation that may arise in favour of the 
Issuer, including, not only those deriving from the insurance policies related to 
the loans, which are also assigned by the Issuer to the Fund, but also those 
deriving from any accessory right to the Participated Mortgage Loan, and 
excluding the fees established in each one of the Participated Mortgage Loans, 
which will remain for the account of the Issuer as part of the price in accordance 
with paragraph IV.1.b). 
All the aforementioned rights will accrue in favour of the Fund from the date of 
granting of the Incorporation Deed and issue of the Mortgage Shares, except for the 
ordinary interest and the arrears interest, which will accrue from the last interest 
liquidation date of each of the Participated Mortgage Loans and from the non-
payment date, as the case may be, of the relevant Participated Mortgage Loans, 
respectively, both dates being prior to or equal to the Incorporation Date. This 
notwithstanding, an amount equal to the ordinary interest accrued from the last 
coupon payment date to the Incorporation Date and to the arrears interest which the 
Participated Mortgage Loans may have accrued from the relevant non-payment date 
to the Incorporation Date shall be paid to the Issuer in accordance with paragraph 
IV.1.b).  
The rights of the Fund resulting from the Mortgage Shares are tied to the payments 
made by the debtors of the Participated Mortgage Loans and, therefore, they are 
directly affected by the evolution, delays, cash advances or any other issue affecting 
them. 
Until the granting of the Incorporation Deed, the Issuer will be beneficiary of the 
insurance policies against damages subscribed by the mortgagors with regard to the 
 
 
108 


 
mortgaged properties, in guarantee of the Participated Mortgage Loans, up to the 
secured amount, with each one of the Participated Mortgage Loan deeds authorising 
that, in the event of default of payment of the corresponding insurance premium by 
the debtor (policyholder), the Issuer, as mortgage creditor, may satisfy at the expense 
of the debtor, the amount that corresponds to the premium. By means of the 
Incorporation Deed of the Fund, the Issuer will formalise the assignment of the rights 
corresponding to it as beneficiary of these insurance policies against damages 
subscribed by the mortgagors or any other insurance policy which may grant an 
equivalent cover. All the amounts that should be collected by the Issuer regarding this 
item shall be accrued due, therefore, to the Fund, as holder of the Mortgage Shares. 
The payments made to the Fund as interest of the Mortgage Shares will not be 
subject to withholding as established in Article 59.k) of Royal Decree 1777/2004, of 
July 30, by means of which the Corporate Tax Regulation is approved. 
d) 
Rules foreseen for the substitution of Mortgage Shares in the event of early 
repayment of those initially contained in the Fund 
In the event of early repayment of the Mortgage Shares following the anticipated 
reimbursement of the principal of the Participated Mortgage Loans, the substitution of 
the affected Mortgage Shares will not be carried out. 
If, while the Mortgage Shares are in force, it is detected that any of them did not 
conform on the Incorporation Date to the conditions and characteristics described in 
paragraph IV.1.a), the Issuer undertakes, subject to the Managing Company’s 
consent, to immediately substitute or, as the case may be, repay the relevant 
Mortgage Share, subject to the following rules: 
1. 
The substitution by the Issuer, which, in any event, shall be carried out at a value 
equivalent to the face value (capital outstanding and capital due but not paid to 
the Fund, on each of the Mortgage Shares) plus accrued and unpaid interest, shall 
be performed by issuing Mortgage Shares from loans of its portfolio which may be 
grouped together in a Mortgage Securitisation Fund, provided that such new loan 
bears characteristics which are homogeneous to those of the underlying 
Participated Mortgage Loan of the replaced Mortgage Share in relation to its 
amount, term (not exceeding the deadline for maturity of the Participated 
Mortgage Loans), interest rate, characteristics of the debtor or characteristics of 
the mortgaged property, as well as credit quality in terms of the relationship 
between the Principal Balance of the Mortgage Share and the appraisal value of 
the property which is the subject of the guarantee of the underlying loan. 
Should there be no loans in the Issuer portfolio of similar characteristics to the 
Participated Mortgage Loan underlying the substituted Mortgage Share within the 
term of 15 calendar days as from the communication referred to in paragraph 2.1 
below, the Issuer undertakes to repay the affected Mortgage Shares, immediately 
reimbursing in cash the pending capital, the accrued and unpaid interest, as well 
 
 
109 


 
as any amount that may be accrued due to the Fund until that date as provided in 
the corresponding Mortgage Share. 
2. 
The substitution will be carried out in the following way: 
2.1. The Issuer shall communicate to the Managing Company the existence of the 
affected or unsuitable Mortgage Share and the Managing Company will provide its 
prior consent to the replacement (as described in paragraph II.15). Subsequently, 
the Issuer will immediately cancel this Mortgage Share and will issue another 
Mortgage Share of similar characteristics of residual term, interest rate, pending 
principal value and credit quality in terms of the relationship existing between the 
pending principal of the Mortgage Share and the appraisal value of the property 
which is the object of the guarantee of the underlying Participated Mortgage Loan. 
Prior to the substitution, a confirmation of the suitability of the loan substituting 
the former must been given by an external auditing firm, in accordance with 
paragraph I.3, that the financial structure of the Fund is not affected by the 
substitution. 
2.2. The issue of the Mortgage Share by the Issuer and the substitution by the 
Managing Company, in the name and on behalf of the Fund, will be made by 
means of the execution of a notarial deed including the data related to the 
Mortgage Share that should be substituted and to its underlying Participated 
Mortgage Loan, and the data related to the newly issued Mortgage Share, with the 
data of the Participated Mortgage Loan, as well as the reason for the substitution 
and the variables that determine the homogeneous nature of both Mortgage 
Shares, according to that described previously. Such deed shall be executed within 
the term of 30 calendar days as from the communication referred to in paragraph 
2.1 above. A copy of this deed shall be sent to the CNMV, to the Sociedad de 
Gestión de los Sistemas de Registro, Compensación y Liquidación de Valores, S.A. 
and to AIAF and it shall be communicated to the Rating Agencies. Furthermore, 
the Managing Company will deliver to the Issuer the multiple share certificate and 
the Issuer will issue a new multiple title representing the Mortgage Shares 
(excluding the substituted Mortgage Share and including the new Mortgage Share). 
e) 
Other conditions established in the issue of said Mortgage Shares and in the 
subscription by the Fund and the applicable provisions, as the case may be, 
for the transfer of the Mortgage Shares 
The Managing Company, in the name and on behalf of the Fund, will fully subscribe 
the Mortgage Shares issued by the Issuer in the same act as the Fund is incorporated 
and the Incorporation Deed is granted. The total price that the Fund, acting through 
the Managing Company, will pay for the subscription of the Mortgage Shares will be 
the nominal amount of the issued Mortgage Shares, plus the interest corresponding to 
the payment deferral of such nominal amount from the Incorporation Date to the 
Disbursement Date. The price that the Managing Company, in the name and on behalf 
of the Fund, will pay to the Issuer will be paid before 17:00 hours of the same 
 
 
110 


 
Business Day when the Notes issue is entirely disbursed according to paragraph 
II.18.5. 
The subscriber is the Fund AyT Génova Hipotecario VI, FTH which is subject to Law 
19/1992. The Fund will constitute a separate and closed estate, without a separate 
and independent legal status. As regard its assets, by the Mortgage Shares and the 
Reserve Fund referred to in paragraph V.3.4 and, as for its liabilities, by the Notes and 
the Subordinated Loans described in paragraphs V.3.2 and V.3.3, in such a way that 
the net value of the Fund will be zero. 
The Mortgage Shares and the Notes to be issued will be described in the 
Incorporation Deed. The Incorporation Deed may not be amended (except in 
exceptional circumstances, and under the conditions that will be described in future 
regulation developments of Law 19/1992) and, therefore, no additional issues of 
securities may be carried out. 
As established in the Royal Decree 685/1982 of the Mortgage Market Regulation, 
modified by Royal Decree 1289/91, the Mortgage Shares will be transferable by 
means of a statement included in the title and, in general, by any means permitted by 
law. The transfer of the participation and the address of the new holder will be 
notified by the transferee to the Issuer. 
The Mortgage Shares may be transferred only to institutional or qualified investors 
and specialised professionals. They may not be transferred to the non-specialised 
public. 
The transferor shall not be responsible for the solvency of the Issuer or of the debtor 
of the Participated Mortgage Loan, nor for the mortgage that warrants it being 
sufficient. 
The Issuer shall keep a special book to note the Mortgage Shares issued from each 
Participated Mortgage Loan, as well as any transfers of the same that may be notified 
to it. The provisions on registered titles of Article 53 of the aforementioned Royal 
Decree shall apply to the Mortgage Shares. Any changes of domicile notified to the 
Issuer by the Mortgage Share holders shall be registered by the Issuer in the book. 
In this book, the Issuer shall also record the following data:   
a) 
Date of execution and maturity of the Participated Mortgage Loan, its initial 
amount and liquidation terms.   
b) 
Registration data of the mortgage. 
f) 
Representation of the Mortgage Shares and receiver entities or entities in 
charge of the maintenance of their accounting record in the event of book 
entry 
 
 
111 


 
The Mortgage Shares shall be represented by means of a multiple title issued by the 
Issuer that will contain the minimum mentions that are provided in Article 64 of Royal 
Decree 685/1982, of March 17, modified by Royal Decree 1289/91, of August 2 as 
well as the registration data of the properties that guarantee the Participated 
Mortgage Loans. 
The multiple title representing the Mortgage Shares shall be deposited in the Financial 
Agent, the relationship between the Fund and the Financial Agent being regulated by 
the Financial Services Agreement signed by the Financial Agent and the Managing 
Company, in the name and on behalf of the Fund. The deposit shall be constituted for 
the benefit of the Fund so that the Financial Agent will custody the deposited multiple 
title representative of the Mortgage Shares following the instructions of the Managing 
Company. 
g) 
Remuneration system of the Issuer for the management and custody duties 
related to the Participated Mortgage Loans to which paragraph IV.2 below 
refers 
In consideration for the management and custody of the Participated Mortgage Loans, 
the Issuer (or the entity that may replace it in carrying out its duties, if appropriate in 
accordance with the provisions of the Prospectus) shall be entitled to receive, on each 
one of the Payment Dates and while the Management Agreement is in force, a 
subordinated management fee equal to 0.01% per year which shall be accrued and 
paid on a quarterly basis on each Payment Date over the amount of Mortgage Shares 
pending repayment on the referred Payment Date, VAT included. 
The calculation of the fee that will be paid on a given Payment Date, will be made by 
means of the following formula: 
C = B x 0.01% x d/365 
Being: 
C = Fee payable on a given Payment Date.   
B = Amount of Mortgage Shares pending repayment on such Payment Date.   
d = Number of days elapsed during the relevant accrual period (except for the first 
accrual period, where the days elapsed from the Incorporation Date until the first 
Payment Date will be considered). 
Any ordinary expenses incurred by reason of the collection of payments  (including, 
without limitation, telephone or postal expenses) shall be included in the management 
fee. 
The Managing Company will be empowered to agree on a different management fee 
percentage in favour of the replacement entity (even in excess of 0.10% per year), if 
 
 
112 


 
the replacement entity is not a company within Barclays Group, which shall be 
accrued and paid on a quarterly basis on each Payment Date over the amount of 
Mortgage Shares pending repayment on the referred Payment Date, VAT included, if 
the Issuer is removed from its management and custody services, provided that such 
removal is legally possible and appropriate having regards to circumstances which 
might obstruct or make more difficult the proper performance of the above-mentioned 
management duties. 
In the event that Barclays Bank, S.A. is replaced as Manager of the Participated 
Mortgage Loans in any moment during the life of the Fund, the payment of the new 
management fee to the new manager of the Participated Mortgage Loans will rank 3rd 
in the payment priority order established in paragraph V.5.1.B)2 (and 3rd in the 
payment priority order in the event of liquidation of the Fund established in paragraph 
V.6.1), before the payment of the amounts resulting from the settlement of the 
Interest Swap Agreement, if the new manager is not a company within Barclays 
Group. 
In addition, as remuneration or compensation for the financial intermediation 
performed, the Issuer shall be entitled to receive a subordinated, floating amount to 
be settled on a quarterly basis on each Payment Date, which shall accrue on a 
quarterly basis. This amount will be equal to the positive difference, if any, between 
the income and expenses accrued quarterly in accordance with the accounting of the 
Fund, so that the resulting quarterly financial margin is calculated (the "Financial 
Intermediation Margin"). The Financial Intermediation Margin will be paid on each 
Payment Date provided that on such Payment Date there is enough liquidity in 
accordance with paragraph V.5.1.B)2 and the exceptional rules set out in paragraph 
V.5.2 and the payment priority order in the event of liquidation of the Fund of 
paragraph V.6.1. and the exceptional rules set out in paragraph V.6.2. If there is not 
enough liquidity to pay the Financial Intermediation Margin, the Issuer will lose any 
right to such Financial Intermediation Margin. 
This amount will not have the character of a fee or return due by reason of the 
delivery of a good or the rendering of a service to the Fund, but rather will be 
considered remuneration of the financial intermediation process performed by the 
Issuer by means of the issue of Mortgage Shares grouped in the Fund. 
If the Fund, through its Managing Company, due to a lack of liquidity in accordance 
with the payment priority order set out in paragraph V.5.1.B)2 and the exceptional 
rules set out in paragraph V.5.2, does not pay on a Payment Date the entirety of the 
management fee, the unpaid amounts shall be accumulated without penalisation and 
will be paid, if possible, on the following Payment Date, except for the case of 
maintenance of the lack of liquidity. In such a case, the unpaid amounts will be 
postponed to the Payment Date on which the lack of liquidity no longer exists. 
In addition, the Issuer, on each Payment Date, shall be entitled to the reimbursement 
of all expenses of an exceptional nature in which it may have incurred, such as those 
 
 
113 


 
incurred in connection with the enforcement of the mortgage, sale of properties, 
payment of residential properties damage insurance premiums not paid by the 
mortgagors, etc., and prior evidence of them in connection with the management of 
the Participated Mortgage Loans. These expenses will be paid whenever the Fund has 
enough liquidity and in accordance with provisions set forth in paragraphs V.5.1.B)2 
and V.6.1. 
IV.2. 
Succinct and summarised description of the regime and ordinary 
administrative and custody procedures of the Participated Mortgage Loans, 
with special attention given to the procedures established in relation to 
delays and default in payment of principal or interest, early repayments, 
mortgage enforcement and, as the case may be, amendment or 
renegotiation of the loans 
The Issuer, in accordance with article 61.3 of the Royal Decree 685/1982, is under the 
obligation to exercise the custody and management of the Participated Mortgage 
Loans, the relationship between the Issuer and the Fund being regulated by the 
Management Agreement of Participated Mortgage Loans (hereinafter referred to as 
the "Management Agreement") that will be signed by the Issuer (hereinafter and 
with respect to this agreement referred to as "Manager") and the Managing 
Company, in the name and on behalf of the Fund. 
The description of the agreements referred to in this Prospectus present fairly the 
most relevant information on the same and does not omit any information which may 
affect the contents of this Prospectus. 
The Manager will continue managing the Participated Mortgage Loans, dedicating the 
same time and attention to them, and managing them with the same level of care and 
diligence as would be exercised in the management of Participated Mortgage Loans 
with respect to which Mortgage Shares have not been issued and, in any case, it will 
exercise an appropriate level of care and diligence in the rendering of the services set 
out in the Management Agreement. 
The Manager renounces, in any case, the privileges and powers that the Law confers 
upon it as manager of the collection of amounts corresponding to the Fund and as 
Manager of the Participated Mortgage Loans and, in particular, those privileges and 
powers provided in the articles 1730 and 1780 of the Civil Code and 276 of Mercantile 
Code. 
The succinct and summarised description of the ordinary procedures for the 
management  and custody (hereinafter, the "Services") of the Participated Mortgage 
Loans regulated by the Management Agreement is the following: 
1. 
Management 
The Manager will maintain the custody and management of the Participated Mortgage 
Loans and will receive, as manager of their collection, on behalf of the Fund, all 
 
 
114 


 
amounts paid by the mortgagors under the Participated Mortgage Loans, immediately 
depositing the amounts corresponding to the Fund in the bank account that the Fund 
maintains in the name of its Manager (the Cash Account). 
2. 
Duration 
The Manager will render the Services until all the Participated Mortgage Loans have 
been fully amortised and all the obligations assumed by the said Manager in 
connection with the Mortgage Shares have been extinguished. 
In the event of insolvency (“concurso”) or liquidation of the Manager, the Managing 
Company shall, if legally possible, designate a new manager of the Participated 
Mortgage Loans who shall accept the obligations set out in the Management 
Agreement. The Rating Agencies shall be duly informed prior to the designation of the 
new manager and shall be furnished with details of the replacement manager and any 
cost associated with the replacement. To avoid damages to the Fund and/or the 
Noteholders, in the event that the Manager is replaced in the management of the 
Participated Mortgage Loans as indicated in this paragraph, the Manager will continue 
performing its duties until the replacement referred to takes place. 
The Manager, once the referred replacement takes place, shall put at the disposal of 
the new manager the documents and computer registrations necessary for the 
performance of the Services. 
In the event that the unsubordinated and unsecured short-term debt of Barclays Bank 
PLC has, at any time, a credit rating lower than A-1 according to the rating scale of 
S&P for short-term risks, or in the case that the holding of Barclays Bank PLC in the 
share capital of the Manager is less than 51% at any time, the Managing Company 
will take whatever action necessary to maintain the then current rating of the Notes. 
The Manager undertakes to assume the measures adopted by the Managing Company 
in the exercise of the faculty established herein. 
3. 
Subcontracting 
The Manager may subcontract, having obtained prior authorisation from the Managing 
Company, any of the Services that it has committed to render, except for those that 
may not be delegated in accordance with the legislation in force, by means of a 
private services agreement. The Manager shall at all times bear the ultimate 
responsibility for the correct management as set out in Law 2/1981, of March 25 on 
the Regulations of the Mortgage Market and in the Royal Decree 685/1982, of March 
17, modified by the Royal Decree 1289/1991, of August 2. The subcontracting will not 
presuppose a revision of the Incorporation Deed or an increase in the price that the 
Fund, through the Managing Company, should pay to the Manager for the rendering 
of the Services. Subcontracting shall be communicated to the Rating Agencies. 
4. 
Responsibility of the Manager 
 
 
115 


 
The Manager commits to act with due diligence in the custody and management of 
the Participated Mortgage Loans and will be accountable to the Fund, through its 
Managing Company, for any harm caused by his negligence. 
5. 
Indemnity of the Manager 
The Manager will indemnify the Fund against any damage, loss or expense incurred 
by reason of the breach by the Manager of its obligations of custody, management 
and information in connection with the Participated Mortgage Loans.   
The Manager does not assume any responsibility by directly or indirectly guaranteeing 
the success of the operation and shall not provide any guarantee or backing, neither 
will it enter into repurchase agreements of the Mortgage Shares, except for those that 
on the Incorporation Date are not in accordance with the conditions and 
characteristics referred to above. 
6. 
Deposit of documents 
The Manager will act as depositary of the deeds of formalisation of the Participated 
Mortgage Loans and all other relevant documents, including, without limitation, 
insurance policies and computer registrations. 
The Manager waives the privileges conferred upon him by law as manager of the 
collections of the Fund and as depositary of the Participated Mortgage Loans and, in 
particular, those contained in articles 1730 and 1780 of the Civil Code (retention as 
pledge of deposited thing) and 276 of the Mercantile Code (a guarantee similar to the 
retention as pledge of deposited thing). 
The Managing Company, in the name and on behalf of the Fund, will be able to 
examine and the Manager shall provide, the original of the deeds of formalisation of 
the Participated Mortgage Loans, as well as the remaining above mentioned relevant 
documents, deposited with the Manager, whenever the Managing Company deems it 
appropriate, and shall request a copy of any of the above mentioned documents, free 
of charges for a period of no longer than forty eight (48) hours. The Manager shall act 
in the same manner in the case of requests for information by the auditors of the 
Fund. 
7. 
Management of collections 
The Manager, as manager of collections, will receive on behalf of the Managing 
Company, in the name and on behalf of the Fund, all the amounts paid by the 
mortgagors derived from the Participated Mortgage Loans, both as principal and 
interest, and for any other concept, including the insurance agreements assigned to 
the Managing Company in the name and on behalf of the Fund, owed by virtue of the 
Participated Mortgage Loans, and will deposit the amounts that correspond to the 
Fund, with value of that date, in the Cash Account. 
 
 
116 


 
The Manager will also pay, into the Cash Account and within the same term, any 
amounts received from the mortgagors in early repayment of the Participated 
Mortgage Loans and that are due to the Fund. On the contrary, the Manager will not 
pay the fees received from the mortgagors, as the case may be, as a result of the 
early termination of the Participated Mortgage Loans, as such fees are due to the 
Issuer of the Mortgage Shares. 
In this regard and in accordance with article 1,527 of the Spanish Civil Code, it must 
be noted that the debtor who pays to the former creditor (that is, the Issuer), 
provided that he still does not know that the assignment has been carried out, will be 
free of his obligation. 
8. 
Establishment of Interest Rate 
The Manager will calculate the floating interest rate of the Participated Mortgage 
Loans, in accordance with the provisions set forth in the loan agreements, and will 
communicate to the mortgagors, in the terms set out in these agreements, the 
applicable nominal rate of interest for the following period. 
The Manager will send information regarding the interest rate set, to the debtors 
requesting it and to the Managing Company. 
9. 
Advance of Funds; residential properties damage insurance 
The Manager shall not advance, in any case, any amount that it has not previously 
received from the mortgagors in the form of principal, interest, prepayment or any 
other amount derived from the Participated Mortgage Loans. 
The Manager shall not take or fail to take any action resulting in the cancellation of 
any residential property damage insurance policy or reducing the amount payable in 
any claim thereunder. The Manager shall act diligently and in any event use the rights 
conferred under the insurance policies or the Participated Mortgage Loans deeds in 
order to keep those policies (or any other policy granting equivalent cover) in full 
force and effect in relation to the residential properties mortgaged as security of the 
Participated Mortgage Loans.  
The Manager, except otherwise indicated by the Managing Company, shall be bound 
to anticipate the payment of policy premiums not paid by the mortgagors as soon as it 
becomes aware of this circumstance, without prejudice to its right to be reimbursed 
by the Fund for amounts so paid.  
In the event of a claim, the Manager shall coordinate actions for collecting 
compensations derived from the residential properties damage insurance policies in 
accordance with the terms of the Participated Mortgage Loans deeds and the policies. 
Amounts so received, if any, shall be paid to the Fund. 
10. Forbidden operations; mortgage extension cases 
 
 
117 


 
The Manager shall not i) voluntarily cancel the mortgages corresponding to the 
Mortgage Shares on grounds other than the repayment of the Participated Mortgage 
Loan, ii) waive or enter into a settlement on them, iii) remit the Participated Mortgage 
Loans, wholly or partly, nor extend them, iv) in general, perform any act that may 
decrease the rank, the legal enforceability or the economic value of the mortgage or 
the Participated Mortgage Loans. Notwithstanding this, the Manager may comply with 
the requests of the mortgagors with the same diligence and formality as would be 
exercised with respect to the rest of its loans. 
Nevertheless, in exceptional circumstances and in order to avoid the costs and 
uncertainties inherent in all mortgage enforcement processes and to maintain the 
financial balance of the Fund, and always having regard to the interests of the 
Noteholders, as manager of third parties’ business, the Managing Company shall give 
instructions to the Manager or give it prior authorisation to enter into an agreement 
with a debtor, under the terms and conditions they consider appropriate and pursuant 
to Law 2/1994 on Subrogation and Revision of Mortgage Loans, a novation which 
modifies the Participated Mortgage Loans. In particular, having obtained the prior 
authorisation of the Managing Company (which can only be refused with reasonable 
cause), the Issuer shall agree novations of the Participated Mortgage Loans which 
may imply an increase or a decrease in the remaining term of the relevant 
Participated Mortgage Loan (either for increase or decrease of the repayment term or 
for revision of the repayment method), in all cases subject to the limitations and 
conditions established in the applicable Law and this Prospectus and, in particular, to 
the deadline of the maturity date of the Participated Mortgage Loans (October 29, 
2034), which shall not be exceeded as a result of these novations. 
The Manager will not be entitled under any circumstances (not even at the request of 
the Managing Company) to enter into renegotiations of the interest rate that may 
result in a decrease in the interest rate applicable to a Participated Mortgage Loan. 
The Manager will be authorised to permit subrogations in the position of the 
mortgagor under the Participated Mortgage Loan agreements, exclusively where the 
characteristics of the new mortgagor are similar to those of the former mortgagor and 
those characteristics observe the criteria for granting mortgage loans, the description 
of which will be attached to the Incorporation Deed as an Annex, and provided that 
the expenses derived from that change are fully borne by the mortgagors. The 
Managing Company may fully or partially limit this authority of the Manager or lay 
down conditions therefor. 
Any other renegotiation entered into by the Manager will take place only with the prior 
written consent of the Managing Company. The Manager will request this consent 
from the above mentioned Managing Company as soon as it has knowledge that a 
mortgagor is requesting a renegotiation. 
The Managing Company at any moment during the term of the Management 
Agreement, in the name and on behalf of the Fund, and having given notification to 
 
 
118 


 
the Issuer with reasonable notice and justifiable reasons related to the preservation of 
the financial balance of the Fund, may cancel, suspend or modify the requirements for 
renegotiation by the Manager.   
In the event of any renegotiation of the Mortgage Loan(s), the Manager will 
immediately communicate to the Managing Company the resulting conditions of each 
renegotiation. This communication will be made through the computer file established 
for the update of the conditions of the Participated Mortgage Loans. Both the public 
deeds and the private agreements corresponding to the novation of conditions of the 
Participated Mortgage Loans, will be kept by the Manager, pursuant to paragraph 
IV.2.2. 
In the event of renegotiation of the Participated Mortgage Loans, their maturities, or 
any other condition by the Managing Company in the name and on behalf of the 
Fund, the revision of the conditions will affect the Fund. 
If the Manager had actual knowledge that the value of the property mortgaged in 
security of a Participated Mortgage Loan had decreased by more than the legally 
permitted percentage, he shall immediately inform the Managing Company and, upon 
its request, shall request the borrower to extend the mortgage to other goods in order 
to cover the mandatory relationship between the value of the goods and the secured 
credit, in accordance with articles 26 and 29 of Royal Decree 685/1982. 
If, after the extension has been requested, it is rejected by the mortgagor, he shall 
refund that part of the Participated Mortgage Loan exceeding the amount resulting 
from applying a 80% or that lower percentage determined in the deed of granting of 
the Participated Mortgage Loan to the up-to-date value. The Manager will be under 
the obligation to deposit the amounts he receives from the debtor in favour of the 
Managing Company in this respect in the name and on behalf of the Fund, in the Cash 
Account opened by the Managing Company on behalf of the Fund, described in the 
paragraph following V.3.1. 
If, within two (2) months of this request being made, the mortgagor has not 
performed the extension or returned the part of the corresponding Participated 
Mortgage Loan, it will be understood that that he has opted for the repayment of the 
Participated Mortgage Loan, which will be immediately requested by the Manager. 
Once the amount corresponding to the Participated Mortgage Loan has been received, 
the Manager will immediately deposit, in the name and on behalf of the Fund, the 
relevant part in favour of the Managing Company. 
The debtors may apply for subrogation of a new creditor to the Manager of the 
Participated Mortgage Loans pursuant to Law 2/1994 on Subrogation and Revision of 
Mortgage Loans. Subrogation of a new creditor under the Participated Mortgage Loan 
and the subsequent payment of the amount due will result in the early repayment of 
the Participated Mortgage Loan and of the relevant Mortgage Share. 
 
 
119 


 
Amendments of the Participated Mortgage Loans shall in no event result in an 
alteration of the periodicity of repayment of the principal amount of the Participated 
Mortgage Loans.  
11. Abilities of the holder of the Mortgage Shares in the event of breach of 
their obligations by the mortgagor 
Enforcement action against the mortgagors 
The Manager will use the same diligence and procedures for the reclamation of sums 
of the Participated Mortgage Loans owed and unpaid as with the rest of its loans and, 
especially, it will take the appropriate executive action if its internal processes for 
obtaining satisfaction of the interest of the Fund have not achieved the desired effect 
or if the Managing Company, after analysis of the specific circumstances, considers it 
appropriate, in accordance with the Manager. 
In the event of non-payment by any mortgagor, the Fund, through its Managing 
Company, will have the following abilities pursuant to the provisions set forth in article 
66 of the Royal Decree 685/1982 of March 17, as modified by Royal Decree 1289/91, 
of August 2: 
(a) to compel the Manager to seek the enforcement of the mortgage; 
(b) to take part equally in the rights exercised by the Manager, in its enforcement 
against the debtor, appearing in any enforcement procedure initiated by it, and 
to have a stake in the proceeds of the auction, in proportion to its percentage in 
the enforced loan; 
(c) if the Manager does not begin the procedure within sixty (60) calendar days 
following the notarial diligence of requesting the payment of the debt, the 
Managing Company, in the name and on behalf of the Fund, will be entitled 
subsidiarily to exercise the enforcement action of the Participated Mortgage Loan 
for the amount corresponding to the percentage of its share, both for principal 
and for interest; and 
(d) in the event that the Manager brings an end to the procedure, the Fund, 
represented by the Managing Company, may subrogate the position of such 
Manager and continue the enforcement procedure without the need for the 
above-mentioned term to have expired. 
In the cases set out in paragraphs (c) and (d), the Managing Company, in the name 
and on behalf of the Fund, may request from the relevant judge the opening of 
proceedings or the continuation of the relevant mortgage enforcement procedure, 
attaching to such formal request the original title of the Mortgage Share, detaching 
the duly attested summons mentioned in paragraph (c) above and the certificate of 
registration and subsistence of the mortgage. 
 
 
120 


 
In the event that the law so requires, and according to Articles 581.2 and 686.2 of 
Law 1/2000, on Civil Prosecution of January 7, the Manager will grant in the 
Incorporation Deed an irrevocable power, as broad and sufficient as required by law 
in favour of the Managing Company, so that it, acting in name and on behalf of the 
Manager, may summon the mortgage debtor of any of the Participated Mortgage 
Loans and demand payment of his debt. 
The Fund, in its capacity as holder of the Mortgage Share and through the Managing 
Company, may also take part in the enforcement procedure with rights equal to those 
of the Manager and may demand, in accordance with Articles 691 et seq. of the Civil 
Prosecution Law, the vesting of the real estate property mortgaged as payment of its 
credit. The Managing Company shall sell the real estate properties assigned as soon 
as it is possible under market conditions. 
Additionally, the Manager must inform the Managing Company about the bad debts, 
early repayments, revisions of interest rates, payment requirements, judicial actions or 
any material circumstance affecting the Participated Mortgage Loans. Likewise, the 
Manager will provide the Managing Company with all documentation required by such 
Manager in connection with such Loans and especially the documentation necessary 
for the filing of judicial actions by the Managing Company, as the case may be. 
Enforcement action against the Issuer 
If the non-payment of the principal amount or interest is not attributable to the non 
payment of the Participated Mortgage Loans’ debtors, the Managing Company, in the 
name and on behalf of the Fund, shall be entitled to an enforcement action against 
the Issuer for the settlement of the maturities of the Mortgage Shares with respect to 
principal and interest. 
Upon the extinguishing of the Participated Mortgage Loans, the Fund, through its 
Managing Company, will reserve the right to take action against the Issuer until it has 
complied in full with its obligations. 
12. 
Liability assumed by the Issuer vis-à-vis the holder of the Mortgage 
Shares 
In accordance with Law 19/1992, the risk of unpaid Mortgage Shares shall be borne 
by the Noteholders. Therefore, the Manager, in its capacity as Issuer, does not 
assume any liability for the non payment of the mortgage debtors, either of principal, 
or of interest or any other amount due by virtue of the Participated Mortgage Loans 
corresponding to the Mortgage Shares.

the Fund 
The tables shown in the following paragraph V.1.3 refer to one of the possible 
scenarios that, regarding income and payments related to the Fund, may arise during 
the life of the Fund and the issue of the Notes. 
For the preparation of the mentioned charts of the financial service of the Notes and 
of the cash flow of the Fund, the following hypotheses have been used: 
a) 
Participated Mortgage Loans 
(i) 
Number of Participated Mortgage Loans: 4,827  
(ii) Volume of the portfolio on May 16, 2005, from which the loans corresponding to 
the issue of the Mortgage Shares will be extracted: 709,644,270.35 euros. 
(iii) Interest rate: the weighted average interest rate of the Participated Mortgage 
Loans, on May 16, 2005 (when the initial selection of the mortgage loans granted 
by the Issuer took place, on the basis of which the financial formulation of the 
 
 
128 


 
funds has been carried out), was 2.743% per annum and, as a consequence, it has 
been used for the calculation of the income flows of the Fund.   
(iv) CPR: three scenarios at 5%, 10% and 15% yearly. 
(v) Proportion of the Mortgage Shares in arrears: 0%  
(vi) Proportion of the Mortgage Shares in default: 0%. 
b) 
Mortgage Shares 
(i) 
Amount: 700,000,000 euros. 
(ii) Principal: participation of 100%.   
(iii) Interest: participation calculated at the same interest rate applicable to a 
Participated Mortgage Loan. 
c) 
Notes 
(i) 
Volume: 154,000,000 euros of Class A1 Notes, 524,000,000 euros of Class A2 
Notes, 7,000,000 euros of Class B Notes, 7,700,000 euros of Class C Notes and 
7,300,000 euros of Class D Notes. 
(ii) Interest rate: floating interest rate corresponding to the principal balances of each 
of the Classes A1, A2, B, C and D, assuming that the interest rate of each Class 
stays constant at 2.176% for the Class A1 Notes, 2.276% for the Class A2 Notes, 
2.386% the Class B Notes, 2.626% for the Class C Notes and 3.876% for the Class 
D Notes, respectively, for a 3 month Euribor reference interest rate of 2.126%, 
except for the first Interest Accrual Period, in which the sum of the reference 
interest rate resulting from the interpolation and the relevant spread of each Class 
results in a rate of except for the first Interest Accrual Period, in which the sum of 
the reference interest rate resulting from the interpolation and the relevant spread 
of each Class results in a rate of 2.186% for the Class A1 Notes, 2.286 for Class A2 
Notes, 2.396% for Class B Notes, 2.636% for Class C Notes and 3.886% for Class 
D Notes.  
(iii) Exercise by the Issuer of the option of Early Repayment of the Notes of each Class 
when the amount of Mortgage Shares pending repayment is lower than 10% of its 
initial amount. 
 
d) 
Complementary agreements 
(i) 
Cash Account   
The Cash Account will be held with Barclays Bank, S.A., whose obligations are regulated 
in the Financial Services Agreement.    
 
 
129 


 
Interest rate:  monthly average of the EONIA interest rate  (Euro Overnight Interest 
Average) calculated by the European Central Bank and published by REUTERS in its 
page EONIA, corresponding to the previous month, calculated on the balance of the 
account. For the purposes of the calculation of the cash flows of the Fund, it is assumed 
that the balances of the Cash Account accrue an interest equal to 2.070%. As the 
assets are gradually deposited in the Cash Account during the quarter (i.e. they are not 
deposited in the Cash Account during the whole quarter), it is assumed that the income 
of the quarter is equal to 2/3 of the average balance of the Cash Account. 
(ii) Initial Expenses Subordinated Loan Agreement  
Amount: 1,788,250.92 euros, that will be dedicated (i) to financing the incorporation 
expenses of the Fund and the issue of the Notes, (ii) partially, to finance the 
subscription of the Mortgage Shares and (iii) to finance the interest accrued by the 
nominal of the Mortgage Shares between the Incorporation Date and the Disbursement 
Date.    
 
 
 
Repayment: the Initial Expenses Subordinated Loan will be amortised on each Payment 
Date in proportion to the days elapsed on each Interest Accrual Period, taking into 
account a basis of 1,825 days (that is, 5 years with 365 days each), so that it will be 
fully amortised within the term of five (5) years from the incorporation of the Fund. 
Interest rate: equal to the reference interest rate of the Notes (Euribor 3 months or that 
resulting from the interpolation provided in respect of first Interest Accrual Period) 
applicable in the relevant interest period plus a margin of 1.75%. 
(iii) Reserve Fund Subordinated Loan Agreement  
Amount: 6,300,000 euros, which will be allocated to constitute the Reserve Fund. 
Repayment: the Reserve Fund Subordinated Loan will be amortized on each Payment 
Date in proportion to the amortisation of the Reserve Fund, as provided in paragraph 
V.3.3. 
Interest rate: equal to the reference interest rate of the Notes (Euribor 3 months or that 
resulting from the interpolation provided in respect of first Interest Accrual Period) 
applicable in the relevant interest period plus a margin of 1.75%.   
(iv) Reserve Fund
The Managing Company, in the name and on behalf of the Fund, shall constitute a 
Reserve Fund with the funds received under the Reserve Fund Subordinated Loan 
referred in paragraph V.3.3. 
The amount of the Reserve Fund shall be initially paid into the Cash Account. Its 
allocation, as the case may be, during the life of the Fund, in order to maintain its 
Required Amount, shall be made in accordance with the payment priority order 
 
130 


 
established in paragraph V.5.1.B)2 and the exceptional rules set out in the paragraph 
V.5.2.  
e) 
Fees and Margin 
(i) 
Management Fee of the Participated Mortgage Loans: 0.01% per year which shall 
be accrued and paid on a quarterly basis on each Payment Date over the amount 
of Mortgage Shares pending repayment on the referred Payment Date, including 
VAT. 
(ii) Financial Intermediation Margin: variable amount that will be settled on a quarterly 
basis on each Payment Date, and that will accrue quarterly in an amount equal to 
the positive difference, if any, between the income and the expenses of the Fund 
accrued quarterly in accordance with the accounting of the Fund. 
(iii) Ordinary expenses: Euro 27,900 per year. 
f) 
Current expenses, including: 
(i) 
Fee of the Managing Company: 0.02% per year on the sum of the amount of  
Mortgage Shares pending repayment (excluding expenses for annual audits of the 
Fund, publication of announcements of coupon payment, and review and 
maintenance of ratings), subject to a minimum of 30,050 Euros and a maximum of 
150,000 Euros per year. 
(ii) Fees of the Financial Agent: 0.002% of the Unpaid Principal Balance of the Notes 
on the previous Payment Date. 
g) 
Dates 
(i) 
Incorporation Date: June 9, 2005. 
(ii) Disbursement Date: June 14, 2005. 
(iii) First Payment Date: October 17, 2005. 
V.1.2. 
Analysis and commentary on the impact that the possible variations in the 
hypotheses described in the previous section would have on the financial 
balance of the Fund 
The quality of the Mortgage Shares and the mechanisms guaranteeing the continued 
financial balance of the Fund are such that it is not reasonable to consider percentages 
of advanced amortisation, nor percentages of delay in payment and bad debt so 
extreme that, as a consequence of the mandatory transfer both of the early repayment 
risk and the defaults in the Participated Mortgage Loans, the financial structure of the 
Fund was imbalanced. 
 
 
131 


 
As for the effect that the anticipated reimbursement of the Participated Mortgage Loans 
may have on the Notes, a table of performance of the average life and duration of the 
Notes for different constant rates of early repayment or prepayment (CPR) is included 
in paragraph II.12.b). 
V.1.3. 
Numerical scheme of the flow of income and expenditure of the Fund 
The following numeric scheme makes reference to the collections and payments 
resulting from the application of a “cash basis”, for the greater clarity of the investor, 
although, and in accordance with paragraph V.2, the Fund will make a temporary 
allocation of income and expenses on an “accrual basis”.   
This scheme is based, not only on the assumptions mentioned in the previous 
paragraph V.1.1, but also on the constant maintenance of these assumptions during the 
life of the Fund and, naturally, the affected variables, in particular the interest rates of 
all Classes of Notes, as well as the actual rates of early repayment of the Participated 
Mortgage Loans, are subject to continuing changes.   
Therefore, this numerical scheme serves only as a mere indication.   
All investors interested in receiving information about the situation of the payments of 
the Fund on each specific date, should request the relevant information from those 
institutions authorised to distribute it: Managing Company, AIAF and CNMV.

V.2. 
Accounting principles used by the Fund 
Income and expenses will be recognised by the Fund following the accrual principle, 
that is, depending on the real cash flow represented by such income and expenses, 
independent of the time at which their collection and payment takes place.   
The fiscal year of the Fund will coincide with the calendar year. However, 
exceptionally, the first fiscal year will begin on the Incorporation Date, and the last 
fiscal year will end on the date on which the extinguishment of the Fund takes place. 
V.3. 
Description of the purpose or target of the financial operations contracted 
by the Managing Company in the name of the Fund in order to diminish the 
risk, increase the frequency of payment, neutralize the difference in 
interest rates coming from the Mortgage Shares, and, in general, to 
transform the financial characteristics of all or part of these securities 
With the purpose of consolidating its financial structure and of procuring the biggest 
possible coverage of the inherent risks of the issue, the Managing Company, in the 
name and on behalf of the Fund, will enter into the agreements set out below, on the 
same date on which the Incorporation Deed is granted.   
The description of the agreements referred to in this Prospectus present fairly the 
most relevant information on the same and does not omit any information which may 
affect the contents of this Prospectus. 
The Managing Company, in order for the operation of the Fund to be performed under 
the terms set out in the Incorporation Deed and according to the regulations in force 
at any time, acting on behalf of the Fund, will be entitled to extend or modify the 
agreements it has entered into on behalf of the Fund, replace any of those rendering 
services to the Fund by virtue of the  agreements and, if necessary, execute additional 
agreements provided always that such actions comply with the legislation in force, 
have been subject to prior authorisation, when necessary, of the CNMV or the 
appropriate administrative body, have been notified to the Rating Agencies, and are 
not prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders. 
V.3.1. 
Financial Services Agreement 
The Managing Company, in the name and on behalf of the Fund, and Barclays Bank, 
S.A. (as Financial Agent) will execute a Financial Services Agreement by virtue of 
which the amounts deposited by the Fund through its Managing Company in the Cash 
Account opened with the Financial Agent will accrue an interest rate equal to the 
monthly average of the EONIA rate corresponding to the previous month over the 
balance of the cash account (Euro Overnight Interest Average) calculated by the 
European Central Bank and published by REUTERS in its page EONIA. 
The balances of the Cash Account will be maintained in Euros.   
 


 
In particular, the Financial Services Agreement will determine that the amounts the 
Fund receives in respect of: 
(i) 
principal and interest of the Mortgage Shares;   
(ii) any amounts received in payment of principal or ordinary or arrears interest on 
the Participated Mortgage Loans, also for the auction price or the amounts 
determined by judicial decision or notarial procedure in the enforcement of the 
mortgage guarantees or for the transfer or exploitation of the assets assigned 
when enforcing the mortgage guarantees or as a consequence of the mentioned 
enforcement, in management and interim possession of the properties in 
enforcement processes, as well as all the possible rights or compensation that 
could exist in favour of the Issuer not only including that deriving from the 
damage insurance and accessory rights to the Participated Mortgage Loan 
policies assigned by the Issuer to the Fund, but also those deriving from any 
right attached to the loan; 
(iii) amount of the principal of the executed Participated Mortgage Loans, from the 
date of transfer of the property, acquisition at the auction price or amount 
determined by judicial decision or notarial procedure; 
(iv) the amounts accumulated from the returns obtained by the balances in the Cash 
Account; 
(v) the amounts corresponding to the tax withholdings of the returns on movable 
capital that, as the case may be, in accordance with the legislation in force at any 
time during the life of the Fund, must be effected on each Payment Date from 
the interest of the Notes satisfied by the Fund, until it is required for these 
amounts to be paid to the tax authorities; 
(vi) the amount of the Reserve Fund; and 
(vii) any other amounts representing assets of the Fund at any time,  
will be deposited in the Cash Account initially opened in the books of Barclays Bank, 
S.A. (the Financial Agent), by the Managing Company on behalf of the Fund.  
The balance of the Cash Account will accrue interest at a rate equal to the monthly 
average of the EONIA rate over (Euro Overnight Interest Average) calculated by the 
European Central Bank and published by REUTERS in its page EONIA, corresponding 
to the previous month. This interest will be settled monthly.    
By virtue of the Financial Services Agreement, the Financial Agent will assume 
responsibility for the deposit of the multiple title representing the Mortgage Shares 
subscribed by the Fund. 
 
 
140 


 
In the event that the unsubordinated and unsecured short-term debt of Barclays Bank 
PLC has, at any time, a credit rating lower than A-1, P-1 or F1 (its current ratings 
being A-1+, P-1 and F1+), according to the rating scales of S&P, Moody’s and Fitch 
for short-term risks, respectively, or in the case that the holding of Barclays Bank PLC 
in the share capital of the Financial Agent is less than 51% at any time, the Financial 
Agent, within a period of thirty (30) Business Days following the assignment of this 
lower rating or the decrease in the holding of Barclays Bank PLC in the Financial Agent 
below such percentage: 
(a) shall obtain from a credit entity whose short-term debt has a rating of at least A-
1, P-1 and F1 in accordance with the rating scales of S&P, Moody’s and Fitch for 
short term risks, a joint and several first demand guarantee of the amounts 
deposited in the Cash Account, or 
(b) shall transfer the Cash Account of the Fund to an entity with a non-subordinated 
and unsecured short-term debt of at least A-1, P-1 and F1 ratings (in accordance 
with S&P, Moody’s and Fitch short-term debt rating scales, respectively), 
arranging for the best obtainable return of the balances of the Cash Account, or 
(c) if options a) and b) above are not possible, the Managing Company shall obtain 
from the Financial Agent or a third party collateral security in favour of the Fund 
on financial assets with a credit rating of not less than that of the Spanish State 
Government Debt (“Deuda Pública del Estado Español”), in an amount sufficient 
to guarantee the commitments established in the Financial Services Agreement, 
or 
(d) if none of the above-mentioned measures may be achieved, the Managing 
Company will replace the Financial Agent with another credit entity whose short-
term debt has a rating of at least A-1, P-1 and F1, according to the mentioned 
scales, obtaining the best obtainable return of the balances of the Cash Account. 
In event (b) above, the Managing Company will subsequently re-transfer the balance 
of the Cash Account back to the Financial Agent, provided that the non-subordinated 
and unsecured short-term debt of Barclays Bank PLC is assigned the aforementioned 
A-1, P-1 and F1 ratings and the stake held by Barclays Bank PLC in the Financial 
Agent is equal or higher than 51%. 
The substitution of the Financial Agent will in no event negatively affect the ratings of 
the Notes. 
Likewise, in the event that the ratings on the on the non-subordinated and unsecured 
short-term debt of Barclays Bank PLC falls to A-1 (in accordance with S&P short-term 
debt rating scale), if the balance of the Cash Account exceeds 20% of the Unpaid 
Principal Balance of the Notes on a given Payment Date, the Managing Company will 
deposit the difference on the Excess Balance Account opened by the Managing 
Company in another credit entity whose short-term debt is assigned a minimum rating 
 
 
141 


 
of A-1+ (in accordance the aforementioned rating scale), agreeing for the best 
obtainable return of such balance. Likewise, if Barclays Bank PLC recovers the A-1 
rating (in accordance with S&P short-term debt rating scale), the Managing Company 
may retransfer to the Cash Account opened in the Financial Agent the balance of the 
Excess Balance Account. 
Similarly, in the event that the non-subordinated and unsecured short-term debt of 
Barclays Bank PLC attains again the A-1+ rating (in accordance with S&P short-term 
debt rating scale), the Managing Company will subsequently transfer to the Cash 
Account opened with the Financial Agent the then balance of the Excess Balance 
Account.  
V.3.2. 
Initial Expenses Subordinated Loan Agreement  
The Managing Company will enter into an “Initial Expenses Subordinated Loan 
Agreement” with Barclays Bank PLC, Spanish Branch, in the name and on behalf of 
the Fund, for an amount of ONE MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT 
THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY EUROS AND NINETY TWO CENTS 
(1,788,250.92€) that will be dedicated (i) to financing the expenses of incorporation 
of the Fund and the issue of the Notes, (ii) partially, to finance the subscription of the 
Mortgage Shares and (iii) to finance the interest accrued on the nominal of the 
Mortgage Shares between the Incorporation Date and the Disbursement Date. 
The “Initial Expenses Subordinated Loan” will accrue a floating nominal interest 
fixed on a quarterly basis that will be equal to the result of adding (i) the interest rate 
of reference of the Notes (3 month Euribor calculated in accordance with paragraph 
II.10 of the Prospectus or that resulting from the interpolation provided in respect of 
the first Interest Accrual Period) applicable in the relevant period of liquidation of 
interest, and (ii) the final spread of Class D Notes. This interest will be paid only if the 
Fund has sufficient liquidity in accordance with the payment priority order laid down in 
paragraph V.5.1.B)2 and the exceptional rules set out in paragraph V.5.2 and the 
payment priority order in the event of liquidation of the Fund contained in paragraph 
V.6.1. and the exceptional rules established in paragraph V.6.2. The accrued interest 
that will be paid on a given Payment Date will be calculated taking into account: (i) 
the number of days elapsed in each Interest Accrual Period and (ii) a 360 day year. 
The accrued and unpaid interest on a Payment Date, will accrue arrears interest at the 
same rate as the ordinary rate of the Initial Expenses Subordinated Loan, and will be 
paid whenever the Fund has sufficient liquidity and in accordance with the payment 
priority order set out in paragraph V.5.1.B)2 and the exceptional rules set out in 
paragraph V.5.2. and the payment priority order in the event of liquidation of the 
Fund contained in paragraph V.6.1. and the exceptional rules established in paragraph 
V.6.2. 
The Initial Expenses Subordinated Loan will be repaid in instalments payable on each 
of the Payment Dates, in proportion to the days elapsed on each Interest Accrual 
 
 
142 


 
Period, taking into account a basis of 1,825 days (that is, 5 years with 365 days each), 
so that it will be fully amortised within a period of five (5) years from the date of 
incorporation of the Fund, provided that the Fund has enough liquidity in accordance 
with the payment priority order set out in paragraph V.5.1.B)2 and the exceptional 
rules set out in paragraph V.5.2. and the payment priority order in the event of 
liquidation of the Fund contained in paragraph V.6.1. and the exceptional rules 
established in paragraph V.6.2.  
In the event that the initial expenses of incorporation of the Fund and issuance of the 
Notes and the interest corresponding to the payment deferral of the subscription 
value of the Mortgage Shares were lower than the amount of the Initial Expenses 
Subordinated Loan Agreement, payment of the principal amount of the Initial 
Expenses Subordinated Loan Agreement not allocated to cover said expenses will be 
made in accordance with the exceptional rules of the payment priority order set out in 
paragraph V.5.2. and the exceptional rules of the payment priority order in the event 
of liquidation of the Fund contained in paragraph V.6.2.  
The Initial Expenses Subordinated Loan, due to its subordinated nature, will be 
subordinated with respect to the claims of other creditors of the Fund in the terms set 
out in paragraphs V.5.1.B)2 and V.6.1 , including, among others, the Noteholders. 
V.3.3. 
Reserve Fund Subordinated Loan Agreement  
The Managing Company, in the name and on behalf of the Fund, will enter into a 
“Reserve Fund Subordinated Loan Agreement” with Barclays Bank PLC, Spanish 
Branch, for an amount of SIX MILLION, THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND EUROS 
(6,300,000 €) which will be allocated to fund the Reserve Fund. 
The “Reserve Fund Subordinated Loan” will accrue a floating nominal interest 
fixed on a quarterly basis that will be equal to the result of adding (i) the interest rate 
of reference of the Notes (3 month Euribor calculated in accordance with paragraph 
II.10 of the Prospectus or that resulting from the interpolation provided in respect of 
the first Interest Accrual Period) applicable in the corresponding period of settlement 
of interest, and (ii) the final spread of Class D Notes. This interest will be paid only if 
the Fund has enough liquidity in accordance with the payment priority order set out in 
paragraph V.5.1.B)2 and the exceptional rules set out in paragraph V.5.2. and the 
payment priority order in the event of liquidation of the Fund contained in paragraph 
V.6.1. and the exceptional rules established in paragraph V.6.2. The accrued interest 
to be paid on a given Payment Date will be calculated taking into account: (i) the days 
elapsed in each interest accrual period and (ii) a 360 day year. 
Any unpaid interest on a Payment Date will accrue at the same rate as the ordinary 
rate of the Reserve Fund Subordinated Loan, and will be paid whenever the Fund has 
enough liquidity and in accordance with the payment priority order set out in 
paragraph V.5.1.B)2 and the exceptional rules set out in paragraph V.5.2. and the 
 
 
143 


 
 
 
payment priority order in the event of liquidation of the Fund contained in paragraph 
V.6.1. and the exceptional rules established in paragraph V.6.2.  
Repayment of the Reserve Fund Subordinated Loan will be made on the Final Maturity 
Date or, as the case may be, on each of the Payment Dates, in an amount equal to 
the difference between the Required Amount of the Reserve Fund in the previous 
Payment Date and the Required Amount of the Reserve Fund in the current Payment 
Date. In any event, the first Payment Date on which, if appropriate, the amortisation 
of the Reserve Fund Subordinated Loan will begin will be October 15, 2008 or the first 
Business Day immediately following, as the case may be. 
The Reserve Fund Subordinated Loan, due to its subordinated nature, will be deferred 
with respect to the claims of the other creditors of the Fund in the terms set out in 
paragraphS V.5.1.B)2 and V.6.1, including, inter alia, the Noteholders, except with 
respect to the Initial Expenses Subordinated Loan.
V.3.4. 
Reserve Fund 
The Managing Company, in the name and on behalf of the Fund, shall constitute a 
Reserve Fund (hereinafter, the “Reserve Fund”) to be funded by the Reserve Fund 
Subordinated Loan described in paragraph V.3.3 above and for an amount equal to 
the amount of such loan.  
The amount of the Reserve Fund shall be initially paid into the Cash Account. Its 
allocation, as the case may be, during the life of the Fund, in order to maintain its 
Required Amount, shall be made in accordance with the payment priority order 
established in section V.5.1.B)2 and the exceptional rules set out in section V.5.2. 
The purpose of such Reserve Fund is to comply with the payment obligations of the 
Fund arising from the categories 1º to 12º of the payment priority order set out in the 
paragraph V.5.1.B)2 and the exceptional rules set out in paragraph V.5.2. and the 
payment priority order in the event of liquidation of the Fund set out in the paragraph 
V.6.1 and the exceptional rules set out in paragraph V.6.2. 
The “Required Amount of the Reserve Fund” shall be determined in accordance 
with the following rules:  
¾ During the three (3) years from the Incorporation Date of the Fund, the Required 
Amount of the Reserve Fund will be Euros 6,300,000 (the "Initial Required 
Amount of the Reserve Fund").  
¾ Once the term of three (3) years referred to in the previous paragraph has 
elapsed, the new Required Amount of the Reserve Fund (the "New Required 
Amount of the Reserve Fund") will be equal to the lower of (i) Euros 6,300,000 
and (ii) the greater of the following two quantities: 
(i) 
Euros 5,000,000; or 
 
144 


 
(ii) 1.80% of the Unpaid Principal Balance of all Classes on the Calculation 
Date prior to the beginning of the Interest Accrual Period to which such 
Calculation Date refers. 
In any case, the reduction referred to above shall not be carried out in the event 
that, on a given Payment Date, any one of the following three circumstances 
occur: 
(i) 
the Reserve Fund has been used to pay the accrued interest on any one of 
the Classes of Notes on any Payment Date during the life of the Fund; or 
(ii) on the Payment Date prior to the current Payment Date, the Reserve Fund 
is not allocated in the Required Amount of the Reserve Fund on such 
Payment Date; or 
(iii) on the Calculation Date corresponding to the current Payment Date, the 
Principal Balance of the Mortgage Shares with more than ninety (90) days 
in arrears, is equal to or greater than 1% of the Unpaid Principal Balance 
of the Notes.  
V.3.5. 
Interest Swap Agreement 
The Managing Company, acting in the name and on behalf of the Fund, will enter into 
with Barclays Bank PLC Spanish Branch, an interest swap agreement (“Interest 
Swap Agreement”) under the Contrato Marco de Operaciones Financieras -CMOF- 
drawn up by the Spanish Banking Association (Asociación Española de Banca), the 
main characteristics of which are described below. 
The purpose of the execution of the Interest Swap Agreement is to avoid the basis 
risk of floating rate interest which exists in the Fund between the floating rate interest 
of the Participated Mortgage Loans calculated on the basis of 12 Month Euribor, and 
the floating rate interest on the Notes, calculated on the basis of 3 month Euribor and 
with quarterly accrual and settlement (except for the first Interest Accrual Period). 
The purpose is not to avoid the credit risk, which remains at all times with the Fund.   
The credit risk arising from delays in payments of the Participated Mortgage Loans is 
reduced, firstly by means of the Reserve Fund and, secondly, by virtue of the 
subordinated structure of the Class A1, A2, B, C and D Notes, both in respect of 
payment of interest as well as principal, in accordance with the payment priority order 
of the Fund. 
The swap operates as follows, netting of payments being applicable:  
Party A: The Fund, represented by the Managing Company  
Party B: Barclays Bank PLC, Spanish Branch 
 
 
145 


 
1. 
Settlement Date 
The settlement dates (the “Settlement Dates”) will coincide with the Calculation 
Dates. 
2. 
Settlement Period 
Party A: 
The “Settlement Periods” for Party A will be the period between two consecutive 
Settlement Dates, including the first day and excluding the last day. As an exception, 
the first Settlement Period for Party A will begin on the Incorporation Date (inclusive) 
and will end on the first Calculation Date (not inclusive).  
Party B: 
The Settlement Periods for Party B will be the period between two consecutive 
Settlement Dates, including the first day and excluding the last day. As an exception, 
the first Settlement Period for Party B will begin on the Incorporation Date (inclusive) 
and will end on the first Calculation Date (not inclusive).  
3. 
Amounts to be paid by Party A 
On each Payment Date, Party A shall pay an amount equivalent to the sum of the 
amounts collected in the Cash Account and, as the case may be, in the Excess 
Balance Account, of the Fund as ordinary and arrears interest of the Participated 
Mortgage Loans during the Settlement Period. 
Both (i) Accrued Interest (as defined in paragraph IV.1.(b) of the Prospectus) in the 
initial sale of the Mortgage Shares, and (ii) ordinary and arrears interest accrued, prior 
to their subscription date, on the new Mortgage Shares to be issued by the Issuer for 
the substitution of Mortgage Shares in accordance with the rules provided in the 
Incorporation Deed and in paragraph IV.1.(d) of the the Prospectus, shall not be 
considered as ordinary or arrears interest and are expressly excluded for the purposes 
of calculation of the amounts to be paid by Party A.  
The sum of the amounts to be paid by Party A will be the “Amounts to be Paid by 
Party A”. 
4. Amounts to be paid by Party B 
On each Payment Date, Party B shall pay the amount resulting from the application of 
the following rules: 
1. 
Firstly, each “Individual Notional Balance” must be calculated corresponding 
to each of the Participated Mortgage Loans in relation to which ordinary and 
arrears interest collected by the Fund during the relevant Settlement Period has 
 
 
146 


 
been paid.  For this purpose, (i) the amounts collected by the Fund as ordinary 
and arrears interest on each of the Participated Mortgage Loans, shall each be 
divided by (ii) the reference annual interest rate applied to each of the relevant 
Participated Mortgage Loans, plus a margin of 45 basis points (0.45%). The 
result of such division will be the Individual Notional Balance of each Participated 
Mortgage Loan. 
2. 
Secondly, the Individual Notional Balances shall be added together. The result 
will be the “Notional Balance of the Settlement Period”. 
3. 
Barclays Bank PLC, Spanish Branch shall pay an amount equal to the product of 
the Notional Balance of the Settlement Period, multiplied by the 3 month 
EURIBOR (or the interpolation of the 4 month EURIBOR and the 5 month 
EURIBOR for the first Settlement Period, calculated as provided for the reference 
interest rate of the first Interest Accrual Period) interest rate in force on the 
Interest Rate Fixing Date following the Calculation Date which signals the 
commencement of the relevant Settlement Period, plus 43 basis points (0.43%).  
Such amount will be the “Amount to be Paid by Party B”. 
The Amount to be Paid by Party B will be calculated taking into account : (i) the 
number of days elapsed in each Settlement Period and (ii) a 360 day year. The 3 
month EURIBOR interest rate (and the interpolation for the first Interest Accrual 
Period) will be calculated on those dates and in accordance with those procedures set 
out in paragraph II.10.1 for the calculation of the reference EURIBOR interest rate. 
5. 
Net Amount to be paid 
On each Settlement Date only a single amount to be paid on the following Payment 
Date will accrue, whether to be paid by Party A in favour of Party B, or vice versa 
(hereinafter, the “Net Amount”). 
The Net Amount to be paid by Party A to Party B will be the positive difference, if any, 
between the Amount to be Paid by Party A and the Amount to be Paid by Party B.  
The Net Amount to be paid by Party B to Party A will be the positive difference, if any, 
between the Amount to be Paid by Party B and the Amount to be Paid by Party A.  
In the event that on a given Settlement Date the Amount to be Paid by Party B and 
the Amount to be Paid by Party A were one and the same, there would be no Net 
Amount to be paid by either of the Parties to the other on the following Payment 
Date.  
6.  Additional provisions  
If on a given Payment Date the Fund does not have sufficient funds to pay in full the 
amounts owed to Barclays Bank PLC, Spanish Branch, the unpaid amounts shall 
accumulate and arrears interest shall accrue on them at the same rate as that 
 
 
147 


 
provided in the Initial Expenses and Reserve Fund Subordinated Loans. Such unpaid 
amounts will be paid on the next Payment Date on which the Fund has sufficient 
funds in accordance with the payment priority order established in section V.5.1B)2 
and the exceptional rules set out in paragraph V.5.2.  
If the ratings of the unsubordinated and unsecured short-term debt of Barclays Bank 
PLC were to fall, at any time during the life of the Notes, below A-1, P-1 or F1 (its 
current ratings being A-1+, P-1 and F1+) in accordance with the rating  scales of S&P, 
Moody’s and Fitch for short-term risks, or in the event that the unsubordinated and 
unsecured long-term debt of Barclays Bank PLC were to fall, at any time during the 
life of the Notes, below A2 or A (its current being ratings Aa1 and AA+) in accordance 
with the rating scales of Moody’s and Fitch for long-term risks, Barclays Bank PLC, 
Spanish Branch, within a maximum term of thirty (30) days following the date on 
which such circumstance arose:  
(i) 
shall obtain from a credit entity whose unsubordinated and unsecured short-term 
debt has a minimum ratings of A-1, P-1 and F1 in accordance with the rating 
scales of S&P, Moody’s and Fitch for short-term risks and whose unsubordinated 
and unsecured long-term debt has a minimum ratings of A2 and A in accordance 
with the rating scales of Moody’s and Fitch for long-term risks, an on demand 
guarantee of the obligations of Barclays Bank PLC, Spanish Branch under this 
Agreement; or 
(ii) shall constitute a cash or securities collateral in favour of the Fund securing 
fulfilment of the obligations of Barclays Bank PLC, Spanish Branch for an amount 
that, calculated on the basis of the Swap market value of each single contract, 
allows to maintain the ratings assigned to each Series of Notes as required under 
the then in force Rating Agencies' Swap Criteria; or  
(iii) in the event that none of the above-mentioned measures may be achieved, the 
Managing Company will ensure that a third party whose unsubordinated and 
unsecured short-term debt has a minimum ratings of A-1, P-1 and F1 under the 
scales of S&P, Moody’s and Fitch for short-term risks and whose unsubordinated 
and unsecured long-term debt has a minimum ratings of A2 and A under the 
scales of Moody’s and Fitch for long-term risks, assumes the contractual position 
of Barclays Bank PLC, Spanish Branch under the Interest Swap Agreement, either 
by means of subrogation in the Agreement or by means of the execution of a 
new agreement in substantially identical terms as those provided in this 
Agreement and any related contracts. 
In the event that the ratings of the unsubordinated and unsecured short-term debt of 
Barclays Bank PLC were to fall, at any time during the life of the Notes, below A-2, P-2 
or F2 in accordance with the rating scales of S&P, Moody’s and Fitch for short-term 
risks, or in the event that the rating of the unsubordinated and unsecured long-term 
debt of Barclays Bank PLC were to fall, at any time during the life of the Notes, below 
A3 or BBB+ in accordance with the rating scales of Moody’s and Fitch for long-term 
 
 
148 


 
risks, only the measure referred to in (iii) may be taken, and Barclays Bank PLC, 
Spanish Branch shall constitute the cash collateral referred to in option (ii) within a 
term of ten (10) days from the date on which such circumstance occurred until a third 
party replaces it in its contractual position under the Interest Swap Agreement within 
a term of thirty (30) days from the date on which such circumstance has occurred.  
For these purposes, the “Rating Agencies' Swap Criteria” will be the official 
criteria published by S&P, Moody’s and Fitch, respectively, which are in full force and 
effect at each given time and which provide for the rules for the calculation of the 
collateral referred in paragraph (ii) above. 
In any event, such options may not adversely affect the ratings asigned by S&P, 
Moody’s and Fitch to each of the Class A1, A2, B, C and D Notes. 
The occurrence, as the case may be, of the early termination of the Interest Swap 
Agreement (e.g., in the event of material non-fulfilment by Barclays Bank PLC, 
Spanish Branch of its payment obligations or subsequent external events affecting 
Barclays Bank PLC, Spanish Branch) will not constitute in itself an event of early 
repayment of the Notes and early liquidation of the Fund, except in the case that, 
together with other events and circumstances related to the financial situation of the 
Fund, it would give rise to a substantial or permanent financial imbalance. In the 
event of early termination of the Interest Swap Agreement, payment of the Payment 
Amount which may result in favour of Barclays Bank PLC, Spanish Branch will rank 
14th in the payment priority order established in paragraph V.5.1.B)2 and the 
exceptional rules set out in paragraph V.5.2. and thirteenth (13th) place in the 
payment priority order in the event of liquidation of the Fund contained in paragraph 
V.6.1. and the exceptional rules established in paragraph V.6.2. 
The Interest Swap Agreement shall be terminated in the event that prior to the 
beginning of the Subscription Period any of the Rating Agencies do not confirm as 
final the provisional ratings assigned to each of the series, except if the Managing 
Company and the Issuer mutually agree in such event to continue with the 
incorporation of the Fund and the issue of the Mortgage Shares and the Notes, if at 
least one of the Rating Agencies confirms its provisional ratings.  
7.  Relevant characteristics 
(i) 
Payments to Barclays Bank PLC, Spanish Branch are calculated on a “cash basis” 
accounting principle, as the interest paid into the Cash Account and, as the case 
may be, into the Excess Balance Account, within each Settlement Period of the 
swap determines the amount to be paid by the Fund to Barclays Bank PLC, 
Spanish Branch on each Payment Date; and 
(ii) Payments by Barclays Bank PLC, Spanish Branch on each Payment Date are also 
calculated on a “cash basis” accounting principle, as they take as a notional 
 
 
149 


 
 
 
balance the floating amount which Party A has to pay on each Settlement Period, 
which is calculated on a “cash basis” accounting principle. 
(iii) In the event that Barclays Bank PLC, Spanish Branch is replaced as counterparty 
in the Interest Swap Agreement, references to Barclays Bank PLC, Spanish 
Branch in the payment priority order established in paragraph V.5.1.B)2 and the 
exceptional rules set out in paragraph V.5.2. and the payment priority order in 
the event of liquidation of the Fund contained in paragraph V.6.1. and the 
exceptional rules established in paragraph V.6.2., shall be understood to be made 
to the new counterparty.
V.4. 
Other agreements   
The description of the agreements referred to in this Prospectus present fairly the 
most relevant information on the same and does not omit any information which may 
affect the contents of this Prospectus. 
V.4.1. 
Management Agreement (Participated Mortgage Loans)   
The Issuer, in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Incorporation Deed and 
in accordance with the Royal Decree 685/1982, of March 17, on the regulation of 
certain aspects of the Mortgage Market, modified by the Royal Decree 1289/1991, of 
August 2, will enter into, in the name and on behalf of the Fund, a Management 
Agreement with the Managing Company by virtue of which it will provide, as agent of 
the Fund, (i) the custody and management of the Participated Mortgage Loans; and 
(ii) will receive, in the collection management, on behalf of the Fund, all amounts 
satisfied by the mortgagors with respect to their Participated Mortgage Loans, and will 
deposit the amounts that correspond to the Fund, according to paragraph IV.2.8, in 
the Cash Account described in paragraph V.3.1. 
In accordance with paragraph IV.1.g), in return for the services to be rendered by the 
management of the Participated Mortgage Loans, the Issuer will be entitled to receive 
on each of the Payment Dates and while the Management Agreement is in force, an 
annual subordinated management fee of 0.01% which shall be accrued and paid on a 
quarterly basis on each Payment Date over the amount of Mortgage Shares pending 
repayment on the referred Payment Date, VAT included, whenever the Fund has 
sufficient liquidity and once the payment obligations have been complied with, 
according to the payment priority order of the Fund described in paragraph V.5.1.B)2 
and the exceptional rules set out in the paragraph V.5.2. and the payment priority 
order in the event of liquidation of the Fund contained in paragraph V.6.1. and the 
exceptional rules established in paragraph V.6.2. 
The Managing Company will be empowered to agree on a different management fee 
percentage in favour of the replacement entity (even in excess of 0.10% per year), if 
the replacement entity is not a company within Barclays Group, which shall be 
accrued and paid on a quarterly basis on each Payment Date over the amount of 
Mortgage Shares pending repayment on the referred Payment Date, VAT included, if 
 
150 


 
the Issuer is removed from its management and custody services, provided that such 
removal is legally possible and appropriate having regards to circumstances which 
might obstruct or make more difficult the proper performance of the above-mentioned 
management duties. 
In the event that Barclays Bank, S.A. is replaced as Manager of the Participated 
Mortgage Loans in any moment during the life of the Fund, the payment of the new 
management fee to the new manager of the Participated Mortgage Loans will rank 3rd 
in the payment priority order established in paragraph V.5.1.B)2 (and 3rd in the 
payment priority order in the event of liquidation of the Fund established in paragraph 
V.6.1.), before the payment of the amounts resulting from the settlement of the 
Interest Swap Agreement, if the new manager is not a company within Barclays 
Group. 
In addition, as remuneration or compensation for the financial intermediation 
performed, the Issuer shall be entitled to receive a subordinated, floating amount to 
be settled on a quarterly basis on each Payment Date, which shall accrue on a 
quarterly basis. This amount will be equal to the positive difference, if any, between 
the income and expenses accrued quarterly in accordance with the accounting of the 
Fund, so that the resulting quarterly financial margin is calculated (Financial 
Intermediation Margin). The Financial Intermediation Margin will be paid on each 
Payment Date provided that on such Payment Date there is enough liquidity in 
accordance with paragraph V.5.1.B)2 and the exceptional rules set out in paragraph 
V.5.2. and the payment priority order in the event of liquidation of the Fund contained 
in paragraph V.6.1. and the exceptional rules established in paragraph V.6.2. If there 
is not enough liquidity to pay the Financial Intermediation Margin, the Issuer will lose 
any right to such Financial Intermediation Margin. 
V.4.2. 
Underwriting Agreement 
The Managing Company, in the name and on behalf of the Fund, will execute an 
Underwriting Agreement for the issue of the Notes subject to English law with the 
Underwriting Entities, whereby the Underwriting Entities will distribute the Notes in 
the amounts set out for each one in paragraph II. 19. 1, and once the Subscription 
Period has expired, they will subscribe on their own behalf the amount of Notes 
pending subscription, by virtue of their underwriting obligation. 
The Underwriting Entities assume the obligations provided in the Underwriting 
Agreement, which are basically as follows: 1) undertaking to subscribe for the Notes 
which have not been subscribed once the Subscription Period is closed, up to the 
amounts set out for each of them; 2) payment into the bank account opened by the 
Financial Agent (Barclays Bank, S.A.) at the Bank of Spain, of the underwriting 
commitment by each Underwriting Entity, for same-day value, before 11:00 hours 
a.m. (Madrid time) on the Disbursement Date, after deduction of the agreed 
underwriting fee; and 3) delivery of a subscription supporting document to 
subscribers.  
 
 
151 


 
The Underwriting Entities of the issue of the Notes will receive an underwriting fee of 
0.10% over the total nominal amount of Notes underwritten. The payment of this fee 
will be charged to the Fund on the Disbursement Date by means of the deduction of 
deduction of the payable fee from the amount effectively underwritten that the 
relevant Underwriting Entity will pay to the Financial Agent in the account opened with 
the Bank of Spain in the name of Barclays Bank, S.A., as provided in the Underwriting 
Agreement. 
 
The Entidad Directora will receive an arrangement fee of 0.01% of the nominal 
amount of the issue of the Notes. The Entidad Directora will be entitled to the 
payment of the arrangement fee by the Fund on the Disbursement Date, by means of 
its deduction from the amounts received from the Underwriting Entities which the 
Financial Agent shall pay to the Fund in the Cash Account. 
 
The underwriting commitment contained herein is provisional and subject to the 
Managing Company, the Entidad Directora and the Underwriting Entities reaching an 
agreement on the final spreads applicable to all Classes of Notes before the 
commencement of the Subscription Period. If an agreement is not reached (or in the 
event that the Underwriting Entities invoke any of the conditions for termination 
established below), the Underwriting Entities which do not accept the final spreads (or 
who have invoked any of the conditions for termination established below) shall be 
free from their commitments and the Managing Company will be entitled to determine 
the final spreads on its own. In this case, Barclays Bank, S.A. undertakes to fully 
assume the underwriting commitments of those Underwriting Entities which do not 
accept the final spreads or who have invoked any of the conditions for termination 
established below and will be entitled to receive in turn an underwriting fee of 0.10% 
over the total nominal amount of Notes underwritten by it. In this case, the Managing 
Company shall communicate to the CNMV that Barclays Bank, S.A. will finally act as 
Underwriting Entity by virtue of this underwriting commitment. 
The said underwriting commitment will be included in a second underwriting and 
arrangement agreement, subject to Spanish law, and subject to the conditions (only 
with regard to the underwriting commitment of Barclays Bank, S.A. but not to the 
same acting as Entidad Directora) referred to in paragraph II.19.1. This underwriting 
agreement will be entered into by the Managing Company, in the name and on behalf 
of the Fund, with Barclays Bank, S.A. The terms and conditions of this underwriting 
agreement subject to conditions precedent will be substantially the same than the 
Underwriting Agreement, except for those operating terms which need to be altered 
by reason of the Financial Agent acting as Underwriting Entity.  
V.4.3. 
Financial Services Agreement (Agency of Payments of the Notes) 
The Managing Company, in the name and on behalf of the Fund, will enter into a 
Financial Services Agreement with Barclays Bank, S.A. (see paragraph V.3.1), to 
perform financial servicing services in connection with the issue of the Notes.   
 
 
152 


 
The obligations contained in the Financial Services Agreement with regard to 
payments are basically as follows:   
(i) 
on each Payment Date, to pay interest and to repay principal of the Notes, once 
deduction has been made for the tax withholding for movable capital gains that 
may have to be made in accordance with the applicable tax legislation, as well as 
to pay the remaining amounts that have to be paid by the Fund in accordance 
with the Prospectus; and   
(ii) on each Interest Rate Fixing Date, to communicate to the Managing Company 
the Euribor reference interest rate that will serve as the base for the calculation 
of the applicable nominal rate of interest to each of the Classes of the Notes. 
In return for the services rendered in accordance with the Financial Services 
Agreement, the Financial Agent will be entitled to receive from the Fund for the 
periods expired on each Payment Dates, a fee of 0.002% per annum of the Unpaid 
Principal Balance of the Notes on the last Payment Date. 
In the event that at any time during the life of the Fund the ratings of Barclays Bank 
PLC or its stake in Barclays Bank, S.A. fall below the thresholds indicated in paragraph 
II.4.1 above, Barclays Bank, S.A. will be replaced by another credit entity whose 
short-term debt has a rating of at least A-1 in accordance with the rating scale of S&P 
for short-term risks, P-1 in accordance with the rating scale of Moody’s for short-term 
risks and F1 in accordance with the rating scale of Fitch for short-term risks (in which 
case, the Managing Company will transfer to this entity the Cash Account and will 
arrange for the best obtainable return of its balances), unless the Financial Agent, 
within thirty (30) Business Days from the assignment of this lower rating or from the 
reduction of Barclays Bank PLC’s holding in the Financial Agent below the above 
mentioned percentage, (i) finds a credit entity with the mentioned minimum ratings, 
able to provide a first demand guarantee which guarantee for the Fund, at the 
Managing Company’s request, the amounts deposited in the Cash Account, or (ii) 
transfer the Cash Account of the Fund to an entity with a non-subordinated and 
unsecured short-term debt of at least A-1, P-1 and F1 ratings (in accordance with 
S&P, Moody’s and Fitch short-term debt rating scales, respectively), arranging for the 
best obtainable return of the balances of the Cash Account, or (iii) if options a) and b) 
above are not possible, the Managing Company obtains from the Financial Agent or a 
third party collateral security in favour of the Fund on financial assets with a credit 
rating of not less than that of the Spanish State Government Debt (“Deuda Pública del 
Estado Español”) in an amount sufficient to guarantee the commitments established in 
the Financial Services Agreement. In event (ii) above, the Managing Company will 
subsequently re-transfer the balances of the Cash Account back to the Financial 
Agent, provided that the non-subordinated and unsecured short-term debt of Barclays 
Bank PLC is assigned the aforementioned A-1, P-1 and F1 ratings and the stake held 
by Barclays Bank PLC in the Financial Agent is equal or higher than 51%. The 
substitution of the Financial Agent will in no event negatively affect the ratings of the 
Notes. Likewise, in the event that the ratings on the on the non-subordinated and 
 
 
153 


 
unsecured short-term debt of Barclays Bank PLC falls to A-1 (in accordance with S&P 
short-term debt rating scale), if the balance of the Cash Account exceeds 20% of the 
Unpaid Principal Balance of the Notes on a given Payment Date, the Managing 
Company will deposit the difference on the Excess Balance Account opened by the 
Managing Company in another credit entity whose short-term debt is assigned a 
minimum rating of A-1+ (in accordance the aforementioned rating scale), agreeing for 
the best obtainable return of such balance. Similarly, in the event that the non-
subordinated and unsecured short-term debt of Barclays Bank PLC attains again the 
A-1+ rating (in accordance with S&P short-term debt rating scale), the Managing 
Company will subsequently transfer to the Cash Account opened with the Financial 
Agent the then balance of the Excess Balance Account.  
In the event that the Issuer was substituted in its duties of Financial Agent, provided 
that it is legally possible and adequate having regard to the circumstances which may 
impede or make the correct performance of such functions difficult, the Managing 
Company will be entitled to increase the fee percentage in favour of the new financial 
agent up to a maximum of 0.10% per year of the Unpaid Principal Balance of the 
Notes on the prior Payment Date, if the new financial agent is not a company within 
Barclays Group.

1st Available Principal Funds for Repayment shall be fully allocated for repayment of 
Class A1 Notes until the Payment Date on which Class A1 Notes have been fully 
repaid. 
2nd Once Class A1 Notes have been fully repaid and until the first Payment Date 
(included) on which the Unpaid Principal Balance of Class B, Class C and Class D 
Notes represents at least 6.3% of the Unpaid Principal Balance of all Classes of Notes, 
the Available Principal Funds for Repayment shall be solely allocated for repayment of 
Class A2 Notes.  
3rd After the Payment Date on which the ratio between the Unpaid Principal Balance 
of Class B, Class C and Class D Notes and the Unpaid Principal Balance of all Classes 
of Notes, is equal or greater than 6.3%, the Available Principal Funds for Repayment 
shall be allocated for repayment of Class A2, B, C and D Notes, pro rata among them, 
in such a way that the ratio remains at 6.3% or the nearest higher percentage. 
This notwithstanding, pro rata repayment of Class A2, B, C and D Notes shall be

Principal Balance of the Mortgage Shares on the Calculation Date corresponding 
to the current Payment Date. 
b) 
The amount of the Reserve Fund is lower than its Required Amount. 
Once the circumstances producing the interruption in the pro rata repayment of 
Classes A2, B, C and D have disappeared, the referred pro rata repayment will be 
carried out again.  
4th After the first Payment Date on which the amount of Mortgage Shares pending 
repayment is lower than 10% of their initial amount, pro rata repayment of Classes 
A2, B, C and D Notes shall be interrupted and the Available Principal Funds for 
Repayment shall be allocated for repayment of the Classes on a sequential basis in 
accordance with their priority order until their repayment is completed.

VII.1. More recent and significant trends in the mortgage market in general and, in 
particular, in the mortgage loans market, in connection with their legal 
framework including the evolution of interest rates, early repayment 
indexes and delays in payment 
The Spanish mortgage market has experienced an important transformation in recent 
years, both in relation to its legal framework and the predominant interest that the 
credit entities have developed therein. 
The most recent regulations have purported to provide mortgagors with greater powers 
of negotiation of loan conditions, as well as to reduce certain costs related to their re-
negotiation. In this sense, besides Law 2/94, of March 30, on Subrogation and Revision 
of Mortgage Loans (which regulates the possibilities of substitution and renegotiation of 
the economic conditions of the loans with a reduction of costs, both fiscal and tariff, as 
well as a reduction of early repayment fees for loans with a floating interest rate), two 
measures were adopted with the aim of reducing the costs of subrogation operations 
and modifying novation of mortgage loans: on the one hand, the agreement entered 
into by the Ministry of Economy with banks and saving banks, reducing fees; and on 
the other hand, the approval of Royal Decree 2616/1996, of December 20, and Royal 
Decree-Law 2/2003, of April 25, by means of which, among other measures, the notary 
and registry tariffs were modified for operations of subrogation and novation of 
mortgage loans subject to the said Law 2/94. 
Additionally, the significant reduction in interest rates which has taken place during the 
last few years, together with the increase in the competitiveness of the credit entities in 
this sector of the financing industry, with the aim of gaining the trust of their clients, 
has lead to a considerable increase in the rates of advance repayment of mortgage 
loans which have interest rates above the predominant rate in the mortgage market at 
the time, due to the lack of offers to renegotiate conditions on the part of lenders. 
Nevertheless, it should be kept in mind that the early repayment of the mortgage loans 
will take place irrespective of Law 2/1994, since the early repayment of loans depends 
not only on the favourable provisions of the law, but also on more decisive factors, 
fundamentally, its age and the higher rate of interest in relation others being offered at 
that time. 
 
 
166 


 
VII.2. Implications that could be derived from the trends commented in section 
VII.1 (index of early repayments, index of bad debt, etc.) 
All the mortgage loans participated by the Mortgage Shares subscribed by the Fund, 
are subject to a floating interest rate, which may be varied periodically in accordance 
with the variations in the market interest rates; therefore, a high rate of early 
repayment of Participated Mortgage Loans is not envisaged.
