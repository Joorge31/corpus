Annex 1Y of the Prospectus shows the audit report on the selected portfolio ol
mortgage loans granted by Barclays Bank, SA, which will mosty be securisod. The
securiised mortgage loans (Iba "Participated Mortgage Loans”) wil be transferred
to the Fund through the sue ol mortgage shares (hersinafle, the "Mortgage

aceordance with paragraoh IV.) confirmation ol tho sulabity of tho replacement

Observations made by the Managing Company

The Managing Company believes it is necessary to give notice ol the unguarantesd
nature of the principal amount ol the Notes that wil bs paid on each Payment Date,
because the main characteristic ol the Notes resides in hat their repayment is directy
ed to the payments mado by the deblors of the Partcipated Morigago Loans,
therefore being dirty affected by the evolution, delay, amicipated payments or any
other related incidente.

The partial repayment ol the Notes wil depond on the speed ol he repayment ot ho
Mortgago Shares. According, here s no way to predetarmino the amounts that will
be applld to the repayment ol the Notes on each Payment Dato

The early repayment risk wil bo passed onto the Noteholders on a quarteriy basis, on
each Payment Dato, through the partial repayment of the Notes. In any event,
payments of principal on the Ciass At Notes rank ahead on a Uming basis ol
payments ol principal on the Class A2 Notes, which, in tum, rank ahead ol Class 8
Notes, vih, in turn, rai ahead o Class C Note, and which, in tum, rank ahead ol
Class D Nolas (except for the pro rata repayment ol the principal amount ol Classes
AZ, B,C and D, in accordance with paragraph 1111.32 below)

It is important to note that constant amual rates of prepayment (CPR) have been
used in the preparation ol the Prospectus; these CPA are 5%, 10% and 189%, the
range which the Managing Company, on bohall af the Fund, belleves represents the
minimum and maximum percentages ol probable prepayment. However this range is
not definitivo. Please refer to paragraph 1.12.) o the Prospectus

It ls also Important to noto that on ho date o registration o tis Prospectus the final
spread applicable for determination of the Nominal Interest ate of sach Class 01
Notas have not yet been determined. Consequenti the chart and examples included
in tis Prospectus which refr to (or oherviso use) the Nominal Intrest ato of ho
all Classes of Notes have been prepared (except olhenvie indíatec) by using the
spread which tho Managing Company wil determine on ts own in ho event that an
agreement is no reached with the Entidad Directora and the Underwrting Entes on
the final spreads applicable o each Class of Notes (0.05% for Class AY Notes, 0.15%.
for Clase AZ Notes, 026% for Class E Notes, 0.50% for Clas C Notes and 1.75% for
Clase D Notes)

The interest payment ol al Clases is ubject1o the samo uncertainty as describo for
tre repsyment of the principal, since it depende on the payments made by the
debtors ol the Particpated Mortgage Loans. However, the payment ol interest on the
lass A and AZ Notes is loss affected han tho payment ol interest on Class B Notes,
vhich, in tun, is less affected than Ihe payment of interest on Class C Notes, which,



in turn, ls los affected than the payment of interest on Class D Notes, due lo the
subordinated nature of some Classes wit respect to other Clases.

lt shoviá be kept in mind that its fundamenta that the period information hat he
"Managing Company wil provide on a quartery basis to he Noteholdee and the CNMV
ls given al the mes and in the forms set out in the Prospectus or as determined by
tre CNMV in the future. As resulto is information, containing actual figures rather
tran estimatios, both the Notehoidere and the CNHY mil have a precise knowledge,
vith the abovementioned regular, ol both the evoluion of tha Mortgage Shares
portillo (and specifically about any delay in payment greater than ninoty (90) days,
prepayment rates, etc.) and ho unpaid balances and percentagos tha those balances.
represent compared to tha intal nominal amount o! the Notes.

»xample of the calculation ot tho Nominal Interest rato.

In accordance with paragraph 11.03 and in order to make it easier for the
Notoholder to understand the calulation system used for ho Nominal Interest Rato
and ho amount of interest o bo received per Class A1 Note on cach Payment Dato,
the example given below shows th calulaion for ts Clas.

Unpaid Principal Balance o the Note 100,000 Euros

Calcultion ol acerued interest per Note:
100,000 x 2.176% x 90/260 = 544 euros.

The amount of interest to be received for each Class AY Note would be 546.5 Euros
on an Unpaid Balance of Principal ol the Note of 100,000 Euros. Tho example would
be identica for the Clas B, C and D Notes, substtuing the spread ol 0.05% of he
Class A1 Notes in the example, by the spread of he relevant Cass

van

pect lo the first Interest Accrual Period, an example of the calculaion of he.
rence interest rate resulting from tha inerpoltion fllws:

> Emomthuribor: 2161% 150 days

180-120

0 days

2.1410% - 2.195%

005%

If we divido 0.06% by 30: = 0.0002%

If we want to calculte th re

rence interest rato for 125 days (rom Juno 14, 2005
(Cisbursement Dat), included, to October 17, 2005 (st Payment Date), oxcludea):

(125-120) x 0.0002% = 0.01%
Final:
2.198% + O.001% = 2.196%

Noto Ihat in this example the resulting percentage has ben added rom tho 4 month
Euribor because the slope ol the curve is positive (Int s, ho 4 month Euribor ls
lower han the 5 month Euriso).

Once tha reference interest ato resuling from the interpoation has been fia, the
amount of interest to be received shall be calculated as described above for any
Interest Accrual Period.

CHAPTER VI!

RECENT EVOLUTION AND PERSPECTIVES OF THE MORTGAGE MARKET IN GENERAL ANO THE
MORTGAGE LOANS MARKET IN PARTICULAR THAT COULD AFFECT THE FINANCIAL
PERSPECTIVE OF THE MORTOAOE SECURITISATION FUND.

.. More recent and significant trends in the mortgage market in general and, in
particular, in the mortgage loans market, in connection with their legal
framework including the evolution of interest rates, early repaymont
indexes and delays in payment

The Spanish mortgage market has experienced an important transformation n recent
years, both ín elaion o its legal framework and the predominant interest that the
credit entitashave developed therein

The most recent regulations have purportd to provide mortgagors with greate
ot negotition of loan condiions, as well as o reduce c
egotation. In vs sense, besides Law 2/94, ol March 30, on Subrogation and Revision
úl Mortgage Loans (which regulaes tha possisiitis ot substitution and renegotiaion
tre economic conditions of th loans with a reduction ol costs, both fecal and tail as
elas a reductión ol early repayment fees or loans with a floating Interest rato), two
measures were adopted wih the aim of reducing the costs of subrogaton operations
and modiling novation of mortgage loans: on the one hand, the agreement enterad
into by the Ministry ol Economy with banks and saving banks, reducing feos; and on
the other hand, the approval ol Royal Decres 2616/1995, ol December 20, and Royal
Detree-Law 2/2003, ol Ap 25, by means ol which, among olher measures, the notary
and registry tarils were modiied for operations of subrogatlon and novaton 01
mortgage loans subjec o tho said Law 2/94,

powers
in cost related to their

Acéllionaly, th significant reuction in interest rates which has taken place during he
last few years, together wit the increase in the competiiweness of the redil enis in
his sector ol the financing Industry, wih tho aim of gaining tha trust ol their clients
has lead to a considerable increase ín tha rates ol advance repayment of mortgage
loans which have intoest rates above the predominant rate in the mortgage market al
the timo, dueto ho lack o oers torenegotiate conditions on tho parto enders

Nevertrolss, should be kept in mind that the sariyrepayment o! the mortgage loans
vil take place respecte of Law 2/1994, since the early repayment of loans depende
ot only on th favourablo proviions of ho law, but also on more decisva factors,
fundamental, its age and the higher rate of interest in relation others being offered at
trat time,



2

Implications that could be derived from tho trends commented in section:
VILA (index ot early repayments, index ot bad debt, etc)

Al the mortgage loans paricipated by th Mortgage Sharas subscribed by tho Fund,
are subject o a floating interest rat, which may be vared periodica, n accordance
with the varíaions in the market interest rates; therefore, a high rate of sary
ropayment ol Pariipated Mortgage Loans is not envisaged,
