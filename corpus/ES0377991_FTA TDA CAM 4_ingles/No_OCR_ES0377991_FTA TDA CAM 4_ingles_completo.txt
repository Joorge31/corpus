When a non-payment that indicates serious and permanent imbalance of the securities issued 
occurs, or is expected.  
(iv)

the Fund.

Date and in situation (ii) above, when it is in accordance with current legislation. 
In any event, the Fund will be extinguished in the event of the following:

the last Mortgage Loan grouped in the Fund, even if there remain amounts to be collected, and

Risk of prepayment of the Shares and Certificates: 
The Shares and Certificates grouped in the Fund are subject to prepayment when the debtors of the

amortisation of the Bonds may vary in respect of the amounts initially established for each Payment Date.

audit report applies.

The Sociedad Gestora is qualified to arrange Fondos de Titulización, and, accordingly, to administer 
and legally represent them, pursuant to Royal Decree 926/1998. 
The deed containing the Fund Regulations will be drawn up prior to the beginning of the Subscription

Pursuant to Royal Decree 926/1998 neither the Fund nor the securities issued by it will be registered 
in the Registro Mercantil (Commercial Register). 
II.1.2. Listing and Liquidity of the Bonds 
This issue is expected to be listed on the AIAF Fixed Income Market.

II.2 Prior Administrative Authorisation 
No prior administrative authorisation is necessary, except the general verification regime of the CNMV. 
II.3 Evaluation of the Inherent Risk of the Bonds 
The Sociedad Gestora in its capacity as founder and legal representative of the Fund, and the Seller, as 
seller of the Shares and Certificates, have agreed to request Fitch Ratings España, S.A., (hereon, Fitch) 
and Moody's Investors Service España, S.A., (hereon, Moody’s) to assign ratings to each one of the 
Series of Bonds, in accordance with art. 5.1.d) of Royal Decree 926/1998, (hereon, Rating Agencies).  
The following provisional ratings will be assigned by the Rating Agencies: 
 
Fitch 
Moody’s 
Series A
AAA 
Aaa 
Series B
A 
A2 
The Rating Agencies were commissioned to perform an evaluation of the Bonds and provide the rating 
thereof. 


This prospectus is a translation into English of the original "Folleto Informativo" drafted in Spanish language and registered with the 
"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores" (the Spanish Securities Market Commission, "CNMV") on March 8th, 2005. The "Folleto 
Informativo" drafted in the Spanish language is the only official document, and no document other than the "Folleto Informativo"shall have 
any legal effect or be relied upon with regard to the Note Issue. 
 
7 
Fitch’s rating considerations 
Fitch’s ratings to each Series of Bonds measure the ability of the Fund to comply with interest payments 
on each Payment Date and the reimbursement of principal during the life of the operation, and, in any 
event, before June 26, 2039, in accordance with the conditions established for each Series in this 
Prospectus and in the Fund Regulations. 
Fitch’s rating is based on the quality of the Shares and Certificates grouped in the Fund, on the available 
credit enhancement and the legal and financial aspects of the Bonds’ issue. 
The rating assigned by Fitch does not constitute an assessment of the probability that the debtors will 
prepay or amortise the principal of the Shares and Certificates. The rating does not in any way comprise 
an assessment of the likely level of the yield for the investors. 
In order to make its assessment, Fitch has relied upon the statements made by the participants in the 
transaction, by its auditors and lawyers, and by other experts concerning the accuracy and completeness 
of the information provided in connection with the rating and its subsequent monitoring.  
The rating assigned by Fitch upon the creation of the Fund is subject to revision, suspension or 
withdrawal at any time, on the basis of any information of which they become aware or the absence of 
information or any other reason.  
The rating assigned by Fitch does not constitute a recommendation to buy, sell or retain the securities. 
Moody’s’ ratings considerations 
Moody's assessment takes into account the structure of the Bond issue, the legal aspects of the Bonds, the 
characteristics of the Fund, the nature and characteristics of the shared loans and the regularity and 
continuity of the flow of funds in the operation. 
The rating assigned by Moody's does not constitute an assessment of the probability that the mortgage 
debtors will prepay or amortise the principal, nor is it an assessment of the extent to which such payments 
may differ from the original expectations. The rating does not in any way imply an assessment of the 
likely yield of the Bonds. 
The rating assigned by Moody’s measure the expected loss before the Legal Maturity Date. In Moody’s 
opinion the structure allows the Fund to pay interest and principal during the life of the transaction, and in 
any event before its Legal Maturity Date. 
In order to make its assessment, Moody's has relied upon the statements made by the participants in the 
transaction, by its auditors and lawyers, and by other experts concerning the accuracy and completeness 
of the information provided in connection with the rating and its subsequent monitoring. 
The rating assigned by Moody's upon the creation of the Fund is subject to revision, suspension or 
withdrawal at any time, on the basis of any information of which it becomes aware. The initial rating, as 
well as any revision or suspension: 
- 
Is formulated by Moody's on the basis of a considerable amount of information received, and in 
respect of which Moody's gives no assurance as regards accuracy or completeness so that Moody's 
shall not in any manner be considered liable. 
- 
Does not constitute and cannot, accordingly, be interpreted in any manner as a  recommendation or 
encouragement to Bondholders to proceed to effect any transaction in respect of the Bonds, and in 
particular, to buy, hold, retain, pledge or sell the Bonds.

- And neither does it reflects the market conditions, or the possible needs of any particular investor. 
The absence of confirmation prior to the beginning of the Subscription Period of the provisional ratings 
assigned to the Bonds, of both Series, by the Rating Agencies, will constitute grounds for the dissolution 
of the Fund, the Subordinated Loans, the Swap Contract and the issue of the Bonds. 
The documents in which the Rating Agencies grant the provisional rating to the Bonds are included as 
Annex 3 of the Prospectus.  
II.4 Nature and Name of the Bonds Issued 
The aggregate amount of the issue is 2,000,000,000 Euros, divided into 20,000 Bonds of 100,000 each, in 
two Series (A and B).

The Bonds are regulated by Royal Decree 926/1998, benefiting from their nature as fixed income 
securities that are homogeneous, standardised, and therefore negotiable in organised security markets. 
II.4.1. 
Different Periodicity between the Flow of Income and Payments of the Fund 
The financial service of the Bonds is effected from the flow of income of the Shares and Certificates. 
The Fund receives such income on a monthly basis and makes its payments on a quarterly basis, such 
income being invested in the Fund’s Account and Reinvestment Account during the interim period 
between receipt and payment, as specified in section V.3.5. of the Prospectus. Credit enhancement 
mechanisms are available, which cover up to a certain limit the risk of insufficiency of resources of 
the Fund and which have been considered sufficient by the Rating Agencies for the purpose of 
assigning the rating to the issue described in section II.3. of the Prospectus. 
II.4.2. 
Priority of Payments 
Payment of interest and principal on the Bonds to the Bondholders are subject to the priority of 
payments of the Fund as described in section V.4.2. of the Prospectus. 
II.4.3. 
Other Risk Considerations 
II.4.3.1. 
Risk of non-payment of the Shares and Certificates 
Bondholders shall bear the risk of non-payment of the Shares and Certificates grouped in the Fund, 
taking into account the protection offered by the credit enhancement mechanisms. 
The Seller does not assume any liability whatsoever for the non-payment by the Mortgage debtors, of 
either principal, interest or any other amount that may be due in respect of the Mortgage Loans. The 
seller does not, under any other manner whatsoever, assume any responsibility for guaranteeing, 
either directly or indirectly, the performance of the Fund or give guarantees or warranties, or enter 
into any repurchase agreements for the Shares and Certificates, whether by virtue of the Fund 
Regulations or any other pact or contract. All of the above without prejudice to the responsibility of

"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores" (the Spanish Securities Market Commission, "CNMV") on March 8th, 2005. The "Folleto 
Informativo" drafted in the Spanish language is the only official document, and no document other than the "Folleto Informativo"shall have 
any legal effect or be relied upon with regard to the Note Issue.

the Seller in respect of the administration of the Mortgage Loans, described in section IV.2. of the 
Prospectus. 
II.4.3.2. 
Risk of prepayment of the Shares and Certificates 
The Shares and Certificates grouped in the Fund may be subject to prepayment when the borrowers of 
the underlying mortgage loans prepay the outstanding principal. 
The risk entailed by said prepayment will be transferred quarterly, on each Payment Date, to the 
Bondholders in accordance with the rules of amortisation described in section II.11. of the Prospectus. 
As a consequence, the amortisation of the Bonds may vary in relation to the amount initially 
established for each Payment Date. 
II.4.3.3. 
Other Considerations 
Limited Protection: An investment in the Bonds may be affected, among other things, by a downturn 
in general economic conditions which may adversely affect the payments of the Mortgage Loans 
which support the Fund. Sufficiently high defaults could reduce, or even eliminate, the protection of 
the Bonds against losses in the Mortgage Loan portfolio, which is provided through the credit 
enhancements described in section V.3. of the Prospectus. 
Limited Responsibility: The Bonds issued by the Fund do not represent an obligation of the 
Sociedad Gestora or of the Seller. The cash flows available to cover payment obligations arising from 
the Bonds is insured or guaranteed only in the specific circumstance and to the limited extent cited in 
the Prospectus. With the exception of these guarantees, no other guarantees are granted by any public 
or private entity, including the Seller, the Sociedad Gestora, or any other company affiliated to these 
entities, or in which they have holdings. The Shares and Certificates representing the Mortgage Loans 
and rights they entail, constitute the sole source of income for the Fund and, therefore, the sole source 
of payments to the holders of its liabilities. 
Limited Liquidity: There is no guarantee that a secondary market with a minimum frequency and 
liquidity will develop for the Bonds. 
In addition, in no case may the Bonds be repurchased by the Fund from the Bondholders, although 
early amortisation of the Bonds in their entirety is possible, in the event of the early liquidation of the 
Fund, when the Outstanding Nominal Balance to Collection of the Shares plus the Certificates, is less 
than 10% of their initial balance of the Shares and Certificates, under the terms set out in section 
III.10. of the Prospectus. 
Yield: The rate of prepayment of the Mortgage Loans may be influenced by a variety of geographic, 
economic and social factors, such as the age of the debtors, seasonality, market interest rates and 
unemployment. 
The calculation of the yield, average life and duration of the Bonds involves assumptions regarding 
prepayment rates that may not occur. 
Additional Interest: The existence of delays in the payment of interest or principal to the 
Bondholders shall in no case result in additional interest in their favour. 
Legal Aspects: As of the Date of Constitution and issue of the Bonds, the Seller will grant a number 
of warranties and guarantees on the characteristics of the Mortgage Loans and the Shares and 
Certificates concerning the existence of the Mortgage Loans and any guarantees relating thereto, if 
any, as well as the absence of any obstacle to the issue of the Shares and Certificates, and their

"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores" (the Spanish Securities Market Commission, "CNMV") on March 8th, 2005. The "Folleto 
Informativo" drafted in the Spanish language is the only official document, and no document other than the "Folleto Informativo"shall have 
any legal effect or be relied upon with regard to the Note Issue. 
 
10 
conformity with the characteristics of the Mortgage Loans set out in the Regulations and in section 
IV.4. of the Prospectus. However, the Seller does not guarantee the credit of the debtors of the 
Mortgage Loans. In addition, such guarantees do not enable Bondholders to exercise against the Seller 
any right, which they may have against the Fund; the Sociedad Gestora is the only authorised 
representative of the Bondholders in relation with third parties and in any legal proceedings related to 
the Fund. 
In accordance with the Fund Regulations and the Prospectus, the Seller has undertaken to act, as 
regards the servicing of the Mortgage Loans, using the same care as when dealing with any other 
Loan in its portfolio. 
II.5 Form and Representation and Accounting Registry 
The Bonds will be represented as book entries, in accordance with Royal Decree 926/1998 and they will 
be constituted as such by virtue of their inscription in the corresponding accounting registry.  
The Bondholders shall be identified as such (on their behalf or with third parties) in the registry 
maintained by IBERCLEAR, which will be responsible for maintaining the accounting registry of the 
Bonds in accordance with the Fund Regulations, in such a way that the clearing and payments of the

appropriate commission for subsequent registrations at IBERCLEAR will not be paid by the Fund but by 
each Bondholder. 
Furthermore, entities associated with IBERCLEAR will be able to establish, in accordance with current 
legislation, the commissions and expenses due by the holder of the Bonds for the concept of 
administration of the securities as they freely determine, and which have been notified to the Bank of 
Spain and/or the CNMV as supervising body. 
II.10 
Interest of the Bonds 
II.10.1. Nominal Interest 
Interest payments to the Bondholders will be made, in relation to the other payment obligations of the 
Fund, according to the priority order described in section V.4.2. of the Prospectus.  
Interest for all series will accrue on the basis of Interest Accrual Periods. Each Interest Accrual Period 
will be the period between two Payment Dates, including the first day and excluding the last day of 
such period. The first accrual period will start on the Closing Date (including that date) and will end 
on the first Payment Date, June 27, 2005 (excluding that date). 
All the Bonds issued will bear, from the Closing Date until their final maturity, a variable annual 
interest rate, paid quarterly on each Payment Date on the Outstanding Nominal Balance of each Bond.  
The applicable interest rate for each one of the Series of Bonds during each Accrual Period will be the 
sum of (i) the Reference Interest Rate, determined in the manner established in the following section, 
equal for both Series and rounded to the nearest thousandth of a percentage point, taking into account 
that, in the case that the amount rounded up or down is identical, such rounding will be effected 
upwards, plus (ii) the margin applicable to each Series of Bonds, as is established below. 
Reference Interest Rate: The Reference Interest Rate for the determination of the applicable interest 
rate for the Bonds of both Series will be the 3-month EURIBOR, or a substitute if necessary, and will 
be determined as follows. EURIBOR is the market’s reference interest rate for the Euro.  
Determination of the Reference Interest Rate for the Bonds: The determination of EURIBOR will 
conform to the rules described in this section. 
On each Determination Date, the Sociedad Gestora will determine the Reference Interest Rate equal 
to the EURIBOR, as follows:  
(i) 
The three-month EURIBOR rate which appears on the REUTERS’ screen, EURIBOR= page at 
11:00 am C.E.T. (Central European Time) on the Determination Date. “REUTERS’ screen, 
EURIBOR= page" is the page that reflects the contents of page "EURIBOR=" on the 
REUTERS MONITOR MONEY RATES SERVICE (or any other page that might replace it in 
this service). 
(ii) 
In absence of the rates indicated in part (i) the average shall be that of the three-month 
EURIBOR rate on the Determination Date which appears on “TELERATE” screen 
(TELERATE SPAIN, S.A.), page 248, (or any other page that might replace it in this service) 
at 11:00 am C.E.T.. 
(iii) 
In absence of the rates indicated in parts (i) and (ii) the average shall be that of the London 
three-month interbank interest rates for Euro-denominated deposit operations declared,

simultaneously, on the Determination Date by the following institutions around 11 am C.E.T. 
(the rate will be requested simultaneously to these entities): 
- Banco Santander Central Hispano (London office) 
- JP Morgan Chase & Co. (London) 
- Barclays Bank (London) 
- Confederación Española de Cajas de Ahorros (London office) 
In the event that one of the above institutions do not supply quotes, the applicable rate shall be 
the average of the rates declared by at least two of the remaining institutions.  
(iv) 
In the event that the rates cannot be determined by the above mentioned procedures (i), (ii), and 
(iii), the applicable rate shall be that which was applicable for the previous Interest Accrual 
Period. 
The Sociedad Gestora will keep copy of REUTERS or TELERATE´s pages, or in its case, the 
supplied quotes of the institutions mentioned in part (iii), as evidence of the type of EURIBOR 
established. 
Determination Date of the Reference Interest Rate and the Interest Rate of the Bonds: The 
Determination Date for the Reference Interest Rate for each accrual period will be the second 
Business Day before the Payment Date and will be applied to the following Interest Accrual Period. 
For the first Interest Accrual Period the Determination Date for the Reference Interest Rate will be 
March 7, 2005, before the beginning of the Subscription Period. 
Once the Reference Interest Rate for the Bonds has been determined, and on the same Determination 
Date, the Sociedad Gestora will calculate and determine for each Series of Bond the applicable 
interest rate for the following Interest Accrual Period. 
Margin to be applied to the Reference Interest Rate for each one of the Series of Bonds:  
The margin to be applied to the Interest Rate, determined in the previous paragraph, to calculate the 
interest rate to be accrued during each Interest Accrual Period by the Bonds of Series A will be set 
between 0.06% and 0.12%, both inclusive.  
The margin to be applied to the Reference Interest Rate, determined in the previous paragraph, to 
calculate the interest rate to be accrued during each Interest Accrual Period for the Series B Bonds 
will be set between 0.20% and 0.35%, both inclusive.  
The margin to be applied to the A and B Bonds, in percentages, will be determined by common 
agreement between the Placements Directors, no later than 11:00 am (CET) on March 7, 2005. The 
final applicable margin for both Series will be faxed to the Sociedad Gestora, before 11:30 am (CET) 
on March 7, 2005 by the Placements Directors. In absence of this notification, the Sociedad Gestora 
will set the margin of 0.12% for the A Series of Bonds and 0.35% for the B Series of Bonds. Also, at 
the same date, the Sociedad Gestora will notify the CNMV as additional information to this 
Prospectus. The final margin will be certified in the closing deed. 
Formula to calculate the interest of the Bonds: Interest accrued on the Bonds of both Series for 
each Interest Accrual Period will be calculated by the Sociedad Gestora according to the following 
formula:

II.10.2. Dates, Place and Procedure for the Payment of the coupons 
Interest payments on the Bonds of both Series will be made quarterly on March, June, September and 
December 26th of every year until the Bonds are completely amortised. In the case that one of such 
days is not a Business Day the interest for the quarter will be paid on the following Business Day.  
In the event that on a Payment Date, and despite the mechanisms established for the protection of the 
rights of the Bondholders, the Available Resources of the Fund, defined further on, are not sufficient 
to satisfy all of the payment obligations of the Fund as specified in section V.4.2. of the Prospectus, 
the amount available for the payment of interest or principal will be distributed in accordance with the 
priority of allocations established in such section. In the case that the Available Resources are only 
sufficient to partially satisfy the obligations with the same priority of allocation, the amount available 
will be divided proportionately among the Bonds affected in proportion to their Outstanding Nominal 
Balances to Collection. The amounts not received by Bondholders on such date will be deemed as a 
pending payment and will be paid on the following Payment Date on which such payment is possible, 
without accruing additional interest. Amounts due but not paid to the Bondholders will be paid on the 
following Payment Date (if possible), with priority immediately before the payments due to the 
Bondholders of that same Series, for the Interest Accrual Period ending on such Payment Date. The 
priority of allocation of payments is set out in section V.4.2. of the Prospectus. 
Withholding and other taxes, as well as any taxes that may be imposed in the future on the principal, 
interest, or returns of the Bonds will be the exclusive responsibility of the Bondholders and such 
amounts will be deducted, as appropriate, by the designated entity in the form legally established. 
Payment will be made through the Financial Agent (Instituto de Crédito Oficial), and distributed 
through IBERCLEAR, or the entity replacing it, and its associated entities. 
II.10.3. Position of the interest of the Bonds in the priority order of payments 
Payment of interest accrued by Series A Bonds occupies the fourth position in the Priority Order of 
Payments established in section V.4.2. of this Prospectus. 
Payment of interest accrued by Series B Bonds occupies the fifth position in the Priority Order of 
Payments established in section V.4.2. of this Prospectus, except in the event of its postponement when it 
will occupy the seventh position.

The redemption value of each Bond will be 100,000.00 Euros, equivalent to its nominal value, free of 
expenses and taxes for the Bondholder, to be paid progressively on every Payment Date as is 
established in the following sections. 
II.11.2. Amortisation of the Bonds 
The amortisation of the Series B Bonds will begin once the Series A Bonds are fully amortised. 
The amortisation of the Series A and B Bonds will take place pro rata among the Bonds of the Series 
due to be amortised (in accordance with the following paragraphs), through a reduction of the nominal 
amount, until it is redeemed in full, on each Payment Date. 
On each Payment Date, the Amount to be Amortised shall be the positive difference between the 
Outstanding Nominal Balance to Maturity of the Bonds (before the amortisation to take place on such 
Payment Date) and the Outstanding Nominal Balance to Maturity of the non-Defaulted Shares and 
Certificates on the last day of the month prior to the month of the Payment Date. 
The Amount to be Amortised and the amounts due and not paid from the Bonds on previous Payment 
Dates shall be paid, from the Available Resources, for an amount equal to the lesser of the following 
amounts: 
(a) the positive difference on such Payment Date, between the Outstanding Nominal Balance to 
Collection of the Bonds (prior to the amortisation to be effected on that Payment Date) and the 
Outstanding Nominal Balance of the Non-defaulted Shares and Certificates corresponding to the last day 
of the month prior to the Payment Date, and  
(b) the Available Resources on that Payment Date, minus the amounts corresponding to the payments due 
on that Payment Date as defined in paragraphs (i) through (v) of the priority order of payments in section 
V.4.2. of the Prospectus.  
As a consequence, defaulted Shares and Certificates (those for which the corresponding Mortgage Loans 
have a payment delay of 12 months) will result in the amortisation of the Bonds in an amount equivalent 
to the Outstanding Nominal Balance to Maturity corresponding to the last day of the natural month prior 
to the current Payment Date, plus amounts matured and not collected since the last Payment Date.  For 
this amortisation the Available Resources of the Fund will be used, following the payment of the 
compromises preceding it in the Priority Order described in section V.4.2. of the Prospectus. In the event 
that there are no Available Resources to effect the payments, the corresponding amounts will remain 
outstanding until the immediately following Payment Date. 
In the event that the replacement of the Shares and Certificates, as established in section IV.1.D. is not 
possible, the amounts originating from the early amortisation, on behalf of the Seller, of the Shares and/or 
Certificates, will become part of the Available Resources to be applied, on the immediately following 
Payment Date, to the amortisation of the Bonds. 
II.11.3. Maturity of the Bonds issued  
Amortisation of the Bonds of both Series will take place on the Payment Date on which they are fully 
redeemed or on June 26, 2039 (Legal Maturity Date of the Fund). 
The last scheduled amortisation date of the Mortgage Loans grouped in the securitised portfolio will 
be April 11, 2036. 
II.11.4. Examples of Amortisation of the Bonds Issued

On September 26, 2006 it is expected that an amount of principal Series A Bonds will be redeemed. 
This redemption is expected to be equal to the pro rata distribution among each Bond of the Available 
Resources and always in accordance with the priority order established in section V.4.2. of the 
Prospectus. As a consequence, the following reduction of the nominal principal amount of every 
Series A Bond will take place; the amount will be equal to the pro rata distribution among each Series 
A Bond of (i) the amount received by the Seller from June 1, 2006 to August 31, 2006, as principal 
(regular and early amortisation) of the Non-Defaulted Shares and Certificates, including the Technical 
Advance received and the principal matured and not collected from the Non-defaulted Shares and 
Certificates on such Payment Date; plus (ii) the Outstanding Nominal Balance to Maturity of the 
Defaulted Shares and Certificates, from that same period.  
Under normal conditions of the evolution of the Fund this amount will be equal to the amount detailed 
in section II.11.2 (a) of the Prospectus.  
Publicity regarding Amounts to be paid and Entities responsible for the Financial Service of the 
Issue: Instituto de Crédito Oficial (ICO) will act as the Financial Agent. The payment of interest and 
principal will be announced in national newspapers or through other channels generally accepted in 
the market, like the AIAF Bulletin, or any other which might substitute it in the future or of similar 
characteristics, which ensure the appropriate diffusion of the information, on a timely and adequate 
basis. Additionally, such notification may be effected through the Internet web site of the Sociedad 
Gestora (www.tda-sgft.com).  
Notification of payments to be made by the Fund on each Payment Date will take place on the second 
Business Day prior to each Payment Date, until the final liquidation of the Fund. 
Periodic information to be provided by the Fund is described in section III.5.2. 
II.11.5. Position of the amortisation of the Bonds in the priority order of payments 
Payment of the amortisation of principal of Series A Bonds occupies the sixth position in the Priority 
Order of Payments established in section V.4.2. of this Prospectus. 
Payment of the amortisation of principal of Series B Bonds occupies the eighth position in the 
Priority Order of Payments established in section V.4.2. of this Prospectus, except in the event 
of its postponement when it will occupy the seventh position. 
II.12 
Financial Service of the Fund 
The financial service of the Bonds will be effected through Instituto de Crédito Oficial (ICO), an 
institution appointed as Financial Agent by virtue of the Financial Service Contract entered into by 
Instituto de Crédito Oficial (ICO) and the Sociedad Gestora on behalf of the Fund, according to which all 
payments to be made to Bondholders by the Fund will be made through the Financial Agent. The 
Bondholders will be notified of payments of both principal and interest in accordance with and within the 
time specified in section II.11.4. of the Prospectus. 
The different parameters of the Bonds for different Rates of Prepayment (CPR), assuming the hypotheses

Duration of the Bonds: The concept of duration, when applied to a fixed-income Bond, according to 
Macaulay’s commonly used definition, is a measure of the sensitivity of the value of the asset in relation 
to the change of an index representative of yield observed in the market. In short, the duration is a 
measure of the risk of a change in the value of the Bond as a consequence of the change in the yield of its 
market references. Therefore, this risk measure has a different interpretation for variable rate bonds and 
fixed rate bonds. 
If the Bonds (Series A and B) issued by the Fund are considered as fixed-rate securities for the entire life 
of the Bond, with a quarterly coupon indicated in the following table, the durations resulting from the 
application of the modified Macaulay formula, shown in years, corresponding to portfolio prepayment 
rates of 5%, 10% y 15% would be:

Nevertheless, when referring to duration, it must be taken into account that the Bonds (Series A and B ) 
issued by the Fund are variable-rate, a characteristic that has the consequences explained below. 
During the periods between interest rate revision dates, the market price of a variable-rate Bond will vary 
if market interest rates change. Nevertheless, its price always approximates par on a revision date, as, on 
that date, the cost of holding the Bond may be financed under market conditions similar, with respect to 
the Bond, to those at the purchase date. Nevertheless, the price may not equal par on such a date if certain 
conditions and characteristics (market reference, applicable margin, revision period, average life of the 
Bond, final amortisation of the Bond, etc.) at that moment are valued differently by the market (better or 
worse) than the available investment alternatives. Except for this exception, however, it can be assumed 
that the price of a variable interest rate Bond is par on its interest rate revision dates. 
As a consequence of the above, the duration of a variable-rate Bond must behave in a manner similar to a 
fixed-rate, zero-coupon Bond with maturity on the same date as the interest rate revision date of the 
variable-rate Bond. Therefore, on a given date, the approximate duration of Bonds (Series A and B), with 
a period of revision of three months, can be assumed to be the remaining term until the next interest rate 
revision. 
The value for duration mentioned in the above paragraph is the result of the application of the concept 
defined by Macaulay, but taking into consideration that changes in market interest rates will modify the 
flow of Bond payments (in favour of the Bondholder) which does not occur in the case of fixed-rate 
Bonds. 
The prepayment risk of the Bond, that is, the uncertain character of the amounts amortised on each date 
of payment, will affect the duration of the Bond in a very different manner depending on whether its 
interest rate is fixed or variable. While the effect is very important in the case of a fixed-rate Bond, in 
which case the duration is highly dependent on the average life of the Bond, it is not as important in the 
case of a variable-rate Bond, since in this case the duration does not depend on the average life of the 
Bond but rather on the remaining term until the next modification of the interest rate. 
II.13 
Net Effective Interest Rate for the Bondholder (Yield) 
The calculation of the yield of the Bonds for the Holder must take into account the purchase date and 
price of the Bond, the quarterly payment of the coupon and amortisation payments in accordance with the 
expected schedule, together with a particular hypothesis of Prepayment Amortisation Rates. 
To illustrate, on the Closing Date, under the assumption of nominal interest rate for the Bonds listed in 
the following table, held constant for the life of the Fund and paid quarterly, a price of each Bond of 
100%, the yield of the Bonds for the Holder would be the following:  
 
Nominal Interest Rates 
Yield 
A Bond 
2.255 % 
2.31 % 
B Bond 
2.485 % 
2.54 % 
The formula used for the calculation is the following:

IMPORTANT NOTE FOR THE INVESTOR 
 
The information in the following tables is provided for illustrative purposes only, and the stated 
amounts do not represent concrete payment obligations by the Fund to third parties on the dates or 
periods to which they refer. The Data has been calculated on the basis of assumed constant rates of 
default and prepayments; these rates would be expected to vary continuously during the life of the 
Fund. Therefore, any investor who wishes to know the expected payment schedule on a particular date 
should request the pertinent information from the institutions authorised to distribute it, the Sociedad 
Gestora, the AIAF Market and the CNMV. This information is also available through the 
Underwriters and others active in the secondary market. As stated in section III.5.2. of the Prospectus, 
the Sociedad Gestora commits itself to make this information available to the general public.

II.22 
Taxation on the Returns Derived from the Bonds 
A brief extract of the applicable fiscal regime for investment derived from the present offer is provided, to 
which effect only the current state legislation and the general aspects which could affect the investors 
must be taken into account: the investors must consider all their possible special tax circumstances and 
the rules of application of territory, together with the current legislation at the moment of subscription and 
the relevant tax returns. Investors must consider, furthermore, that they will take into account the 
requirements derived from the application of Directive 2003/48/CE of June 3rd, 2003, in respect of 
taxation of the yield from savings in the form of payment of interest. 
As the Bonds of the present offer are represented as book entries and will be admitted to listing in a 
Spanish secondary market, conditions related to its taxation, it is assumed they comply with these 
conditions. Furthermore, it has been considered that the Bonds, at the time of issue, are to be considered 
financial assets with explicit yield, whenever this category has taxation relevance. 
a). Individuals or Corporations Resident in Spain 
a.1. Impuesto sobre la Renta de las Personas Físicas (Spanish Personal Income Tax) 
The returns obtained by Bondholders subject, as tax payers, to the Impuesto Sobre la Renta de las 
Personas Físicas, purchasing the Bonds in the secondary market, as a result of purchasing the Bonds in a 
secondary market, in relation to interest and also to the transfer, refund or amortisation of such interest, 
shall be considered as income on investments arising from the assignment of personal capital to third 
parties as described in article 23.2. of Law 40/1998, of December 9th, of the Impuesto Sobre la Renta de 
las Personas Físicas y Otras Normas Tributarias. 
In the event of transfer or refund of the Bonds, the yield will be calculated as the difference between the 
sale price, minus the expenses generated, and the cost of purchase, plus, the expenses generated. The 
capital’s net yield will be determined by deducting from the entire yield, the administrative and deposit 
expenses of the Bonds, whenever such expenses do not correspond to the undertaking of a discretionary 
and individual management of the investment portfolio. The yield will be reduced in 40% if the period of 
generation is above two years. Also, negative yields from the Bonds, when the contributor has acquired 
other homogeneous financial assets in the two months before or after the sale, reimbursement or 
amortisation, will be included in the tax basis as the Bonds which remain are sold. 
Such incomes will be subject to withholding on account of the IRPF of its beneficiary, in accordance with 
Royal Decree 1775/2004, July 30, which approves the Reglamento del Impuesto sobre la Renta de las 
Personas Físicas with regards to withholding and prepaid tax. With regards to the Reglamento, the 
following must be noted: 
− 
Capital income derived from the transfer to third parties of private capital are subject, in general, to a 
15% withholding rate. 
− 
Nevertheless, there is no obligation to withhold the income derived from the transfer or refund of the

will be taken into account for the calculation of the income. Taxation will take place separately for each 
total or partial income accrued subject to tax without any possible compensation between said income.

- Said income will be subject to withholding of the Impuesto sobre la Renta de no Residentes, except in 
those cases in which the payment of the Impuesto or exemption of such Impuesto is credited.

residents without permanent establishment, will not be subject to withholding, without prejudice of its 
corresponding taxation obligation, when the following requisites are met:

exclude withholding, when during the payment procedure financial entities registered, resident or 
represented in Spain take part, entities that are depositories or administrators of the payment of said 
bonds’ yields.

rate of the Impuestos sobre la Renta de las Personas Físicas y sobre Sociedades (currently 15%) and will 
transfer the liquid amount to the entities which are depositories. Those entities which credit, following

the first Payment Date, to 1/4 of 0.019% of the non-matured Outstanding Nominal Balance of the 
Shares and Certificates on the previous Payment Date. Such commission will be understood in gross 
terms, including, therefore, any direct or indirect tax or withholding that may be applicable thereto. 
The commission on each Payment Date will not be less than 1/4 of 30,000 Euros. This amount will be 
updated at the beginning of each calendar year (starting January 2006) in accordance with the General 
Consumer Price Index published by the National Institute of Statistics, or its replacing entity.  
The remuneration of the Sociedad Gestora is calculated in accordance to the following formula: 
 
 
 
              RT=(0.019% * Ni) / 4 
On the first Payment Date, the remuneration of the Sociedad Gestora will be established by the 
number of days since the Closing Date. That is, in accordance with the following formula: 
RT=(0.019% * Ni) * di/365 
where: 
RT 
is the amount of Euros of the Sociedad Gestora’s commission. 
Ni 
is the Outstanding Nominal Balance of the Shares and Certificates at the beginning of the 
period (Closing Date, on the first Payment Date). 
di 
is the number of days from the Closing Date until the first Payment Date. 
Therefore, on the first Payment Date, the remuneration to the Sociedad Gestora will be equal to : 
RT = (0.019/100* 2,000,000,000)* 110/365 = 114,520.55 Euros 
In the event of the substitution of the Sociedad Gestora, as is established in section III.8., the 
payments mentioned in said section may be modified, prior agreement on the new conditions with the

− 
Payment of the commission to the Sociedad Gestora as described in section III.3.2. of the 
Prospectus, and occupying the second position in the Priority Order of Payments described in 
section V.4.2. of this Prospectus. 
− 
Commission to be paid to the Financial Agent or the entity which replaces it, in accordance with 
section III.8. of this Prospectus. On each Payment Date, the Financial Agent will receive a 
commission of 4,721 quarterly Euros (4,205 Euros as Financial Agent and custodian of the Shares 
and Certificates and 516 Euros as manager of the Fund’s Account), plus ¼ of the amount resulting 
from applying 0.00343% to the non matured Outstanding Nominal Balance of the Shares and the 
Certificates on each Payment Date prior to the Payment Date in which such payment must be 
made, as payment for the services derived from the Financial Service Contract. 
The commission to be paid to the Financial Agent will be calculated, therefore, according to the 
following formula: 
RT=4.721+((0.00343%*Ni)/4) 
On the first Payment Date, the commission to be paid to the Financial Agent will be calculated by 
the number of days elapsed from the Closing Date. That is, in accordance with the following 
formula: 
RT = 4.721 + ((0.00343% * Ni) * di/365) 
where, 
RT 
shall mean the number of Euros of the Financial Agent’s commission. 
Ni 
shall mean the Outstanding Nominal Balance of the Mortgage Loans at the beginning 
of the period (Closing Date on the first Payment Date). 
di 
shall mean the number of days between the Closing Date and the first Payment Date. 
Therefore on the first Payment Date, the commission to be paid to the Financial Agent shall be: 
Rt = 4,721 + ((0.00343% * 2,000,000,000) * 110/365) = 25,394.97 Euros. 
− 
Variable Remuneration of the Participative Loan. On each Payment Date, a variable payment 
calculated following the procedure described in Clause 14 of the Fund Regulations and in section 
V.3.3. of the Prospectus.

− 
Expenses derived from the publication of advertisements or the notifications related to the Fund 
and/or the Bonds. 
− 
In its case, the maintenance expenses of the rating assigned by the Rating Agencies, in the terms 
initially established. 
− 
If applicable, taxes to be paid by the Fund. 
− 
In general, any other expense to be paid by the Fund, including, if applicable, possible 
commission deriving from the amortisation of the Bond which may be established in the future by 
IBERCLEAR or its affiliates.

(i) 
Obtain similar guarantees or commitments from one or more credit institutions with a rating 
above P1 (Moody’s) or F1 (Fitch), to guarantee the commitments assumed by the Financial 
Agent. . 
(ii) 
Substitute the Financial Agent for another credit entity with a rating above P1 (Moody’s) and F1 
(Fitch), or another equivalent rating expressly accepted by the Rating Agencies to undertake, 
under the same conditions, the functions of the Financial Agent. 
Furthermore, the Financial Agent may terminate the Financial Services Contract, by giving prior 
notification to the Sociedad Gestora of at least two months, in accordance with the terms of its 
appointment, provided (i) another entity of similar financial characteristics to ICO substitutes it, with a 
credit rating for short term risk at least equal to P1 (Moody’s) or F1 (Fitch), accepted by the Sociedad 
Gestora, (ii) the CNMV and the Rating Agencies are notified and (iii) the rating assigned to the Bonds is 
not negatively affected. Such termination shall be without prejudice to the fact that the termination will 
not take place, except when authorised by the Sociedad Gestora, until two business days after the 
Payment Date that follows the notification of the termination. 
Sociedad Gestora 
The waiver and replacement of the Sociedad Gestora will be regulated as established in Royal Decree 
926/1998 or by the existing current legislation. The replacement of the Sociedad Gestora will be carried 
out in compliance with the following procedure, unless it is contrary to the relevant legal dispositions: 
(i) 
The Sociedad Gestora may renounce its role and voluntarily request its replacement via a written 
request to the CNMV. This request will include the document from the new sociedad gestora 
containing its authorisation and which is inscribed in the special registers of the CNMV, where it 
declares itself prepared to accept such role and requests the corresponding authorisation. The 
replacement of the Sociedad Gestora and the appointment of a new sociedad gestora must be 
approved by the CNMV. Under no circumstances the Sociedad Gestora may waive its functions 
before complying with the requests and requirements for the substitute to fully take over its 
functions in respect of the Fund. Neither will the Sociedad Gestora waive its responsibilities 
when, due to said replacement, the ratings granted to the Bonds issued by the Fund, are reduced. 
All the expenses generated by said substitution will be borne by the Sociedad Gestora, or, the 
new sociedad gestora; 
(ii) 
In the event that any of the circumstances described in number 1 of article 260 of Ley de 
Sociedades Anónimas occur, the Sociedad Gestora will be replaced. The occurrence of any of 
those circumstances will be notified by the Sociedad Gestora to the CNMV. In this event, the 
Sociedad Gestora will be obliged to comply with section (i) before it is replaced; 
(iii) 
In the event that the Sociedad Gestora is declared in suspension of payments or bankruptcy or its 
authorisation is revoked, it will proceed to select a sociedad gestora to replace it. The substitution 
will take place less than 4 months after the date in which the event giving rise to the substitution 
took place. If the Sociedad Gestora does not find another sociedad gestora willing to take over 
the administration and representation of the Fund, it considers that the candidate is not 
appropriate, and the ratings are downgraded, the early liquidation of the Fund will take place and 
the Bonds will be amortised in the 4 months following the forced replacement; 
(iv) 
The substitution of the Sociedad Gestora and the selection of the new sociedad, approved by the 
CNMV in accordance with the previous paragraphs, shall be authorised by the Rating Agencies 
and published in the Daily Bulletin of the AIAF Market. The Sociedad Gestora undertakes to 
grant all the public and private documents necessary to effect its replacement in accordance with 
the previous sections. The replacing sociedad gestora will become subject to the rights and 
obligations, that in respect of the Prospectus, correspond to those of the Sociedad Gestora.

or a claim by a third party is placed, the Sociedad Gestora may terminate the corresponding contracts 
which bind them to the Fund, whenever such termination is permitted in accordance with current 
legislation. Following the termination of the Contract and in the event that current legislation allows it, 
the new participant will be designated by the Sociedad Gestora once the relevant authorities have been 
consulted, in order not to affect the ratings assigned to the Bonds by the Rating Agencies. This 
designation will be notified to the CNMV and the Rating Agencies. The replacement of the Seller as 
Mortgage Loan servicer is covered in section IV.2.4. of this Prospectus. Furthermore, the assumptions for 
the replacement of the Seller, as Swap counterpart, are included in section V.3.7. of this Prospectus.

The entities taking part in the TDA CAM 4 transaction, pursuant to their corresponding contracts, this

delegate has waived all rights of recourse against the Fund; they are also entitled to terminate such sub-
contracts and/or delegations. In any case, such sub-contracting or delegation shall not imply any 
additional cost or expense for the Fund nor the Sociedad Gestora, nor to cause any negative effect for the 
rating granted to the Bonds by the Rating Agencies. Despite any sub-contract or delegation, the entities 
taking part in the operation shall be neither exonerated nor discharged from any of the responsibilities 
established in the corresponding contracts, this Prospectus and the Fund Regulations. Those 
subcontracted entities will comply with the rating level conditions established by the Rating Agencies in

By virtue of the Fund Regulations and this Prospectus, the Sociedad Gestora is entitled to proceed to the 
early liquidation of the Fund TDA CAM 4, on a Payment Date following the Collection Date in which, 
the Outstanding Balance of the Shares and Certificates is less than 10% of their initial balance, provided 
the proceeds from the liquidation of the outstanding Shares and Certificates and the balance of the Fund’s 
Account, and the Reinvestment Account when applicable, are sufficient to discharge the outstanding 
obligations to the Bondholders, in accordance with the priority order of payments described in section 
V.4.2. of this Prospectus, and that all the necessary authorisations have been obtained from the relevant 
authorities. 
The Fund will be terminated through the sale of remaining assets only in the following circumstances,

to liquidate the Fund in accordance with the Priority Order of Payments described in section

issue of Shares and Certificates, will take place on the Date of Constitution for the remaining term of 
maturity of the loans without the existence of any repurchase pact by the Seller. The Shares and 
Certificates will begin to accrue interest from the Date of Constitution (included), that is March 4, 2005,

principal, interest or any other amount that may be due by virtue of the Mortgage Loans. The Seller does

indicated in Articles 348 of the Commercial Code and 1,529 of the Civil Code. 
B. The Portfolio 
The asset of TDA CAM 4 is integrated by Shares and Certificates issued by the Seller over loans granted 
to private individuals for the acquisition, construction or restoration of a home located on Spanish soil, 
with a first mortgage on a property appraised by an Appraising Company. Some of the Mortgage Loans 
derive from subrogations of the private individual debtor to promoter loans. 
The Deed of Constitution will formalise the issue of the Shares and Certificates and their sale to the Fund. 
The Seller’s issue of the Shares and Certificates will encompass a still undetermined number with an 
Outstanding Nominal Balance equal or slightly inferior to 2,000,000,000 Euros. 
The Mortgage Loans underlying the Shares and Certificates will be extracted from the 30,569 mortgage 
loans with an Outstanding Nominal Balance of 2,263,140,254.34 Euros on January 25, 2005 which

Certificate or any of the Mortgage Loans from which they are issued, does not comply, on the Date of 
Constitution, with the representations set out in section IV.4. of the Prospectus and in Clause 8 of the 
Fund Regulations, the Seller undertakes: 
(A) To replace the corresponding Share and/or Certificate by another one with similar financial 
characteristics in terms of amount pending collection, term to maturity and interest rate, loan to value and

maturity, (iii) interest rate, (iv) characteristics of the borrower, (v) characteristics of the mortgaged 
property, live balance/appraisal value ratio, and the lack of conformity of any of these elements with

legality or financial structure of the Fund and the rights and interests of the Bondholders, in the justified 
opinion of the Sociedad Gestora, which will so inform the Seller and the CNMV, the Seller will agree to 
reimburse to the Fund’s Account the outstanding principal of the corresponding Share and/or Certificate

damages derived and sufficiently justified to the Seller.

the Sociedad Gestora, implies damage or risk to the financial structure of the Fund or the rights and 
interests of the Bondholders, the Sociedad Gestora will, in accordance with current legislation, (i) 
substitute the Seller as administrator of the Shares and Certificates, or (ii) request the Seller to sub-

Mortgage Loans, and all expenses generated by the substitution will be paid by the Seller. The Sociedad 
Gestora will authorise the substitution if the Seller has found an entity to replace it and if the rating

notified to the Rating Agencies and the CNMV. 
In the event of the substitution, the Seller will forward to the new administrator all the documents 
necessary to undertake its activities.

Certificates for any other reason other than payment of the Mortgage Loans, to waive or compound them,

or, in general, carry out any act that might impair or decrease the rank, legal enforceability or economic 
value of the Mortgages or the Mortgage Loans except by the modifications outlined in the following

V.1.1. Assumptions 
The tables below refer to three of the possible assumptions, (constant prepayment rates of 5%, 10% 
and 15%) that, in respect of the income and payments made by the Fund, might occur during the life 
of the Fund and the Bonds issue. 
For the calculation of the financial service table of the Fund, the data has been taken from the 
portfolio referred to in the previous Chapter as of January 25, 2005.  
In relation to the Shares and Certificates 
• 
Volume of the Loan Portfolio from which the Mortgage Loans underlying the issue of Mortgage 
Share Certificates and Mortgage Transfer Certificates will be selected: 2,263,140,254.34 Euros on 
January 25, 2005. 
• 
Maximum amount of the Outstanding Nominal Balance of Shares and Certificates on the Date of 
the Constitution of the Fund: 2,000,000,000 Euros. To elaborate the financial information 
included in this Prospectus, a selection has been made from the portfolio described in Chapter IV, 
with the following distribution: 
 
• 
Shares:  
 
1,785,839,669.54 Euros 


This prospectus is a translation into English of the original "Folleto Informativo" drafted in Spanish language and registered with the 
"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores" (the Spanish Securities Market Commission, "CNMV") on March 8th, 2005. The "Folleto 
Informativo" drafted in the Spanish language is the only official document, and no document other than the "Folleto Informativo"shall have 
any legal effect or be relied upon with regard to the Note Issue. 
 
69 
• 
Certificates: 
 
214,160,330.46 Euros 
Interest Rate: the weighted average interest rate for the Shares and Certificates’ portfolio is 
3.37%, without prejudice to the revisions which will be established in accordance with the 
following paragraph. 
• 
The interest rate of the Mortgage Loans on each period: the current margin on January 25, 2005, 
is applied for each one of them to its own interest rate. From May 31, 2005, it will be held 
constant, and its value is calculated: a) for the mortgage loans referred to MIBOR and EURIBOR, 
the value is equal to the Reference Interest Rate of the Bonds; b) for Loans with reference rates 
different from those above, the value is equal to the Reference Interest Rate plus 1.131%.  
• 
Weighted average remaining life of the Shares and Certificates contained in the portfolio: 233 
months.  
• 
Annual prepayment rate: assumption 5%, 10% and 15%. 
• 
Annual percentage of Shares and Certificates with arrears other than Defaulted: 0%. 
• 
Shares and Certificates Default rate: 0.3% annually from February 2006, and 75% of monthly 
recoveries from the Defaulted Stock a year later.  
Bonds 
• 
Total Amount: 2,000,000,000 Euros. 
A Bonds:     1,952,000,000  Euros  
B Bonds:     48,000,000 Euros 
• 
Interest Rate: Variable annual interest to be paid quarterly. The Bond’s interest rate is the result of 
the following sum: an EURIBOR rate of 2.144%, plus a margin of 0.10% for the A Bonds and a 
margin of 0.30% for the B Bonds. 
Initial Expenses Loan 
• 
Amount: 2,105,600 Euros. The amount is destined to the payment of the Initial Expenses of the 
Loan. 
• 
Interest rate: the loan accrues a variable annual interest rate equal to the Reference Interest Rate of 
the Bonds during that period, plus a margin of 0.75%. 
• 
Amortisation: the amortisation will take place in 20 consecutive and equal instalments, the first of 
which will take place on the first Payment Date (June 27, 2005) and the rest on the following 
Payment Dates. 
Subordinated Loan: 
• 
Amount: 6,000,000 Euros. The amount of the Loan will be used by the Sociedad Gestora to cover 
the deficit of the Fund, on the first Payment Date, between the interest accrued and interest paid 
of the Shares and Certificates. 
• 
Interest Rate: the Loan bears a variable annual interest rate equal to the Reference Interest Rate of 
the Bonds during such period plus a margin of 0.75%. 


This prospectus is a translation into English of the original "Folleto Informativo" drafted in Spanish language and registered with the 
"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores" (the Spanish Securities Market Commission, "CNMV") on March 8th, 2005. The "Folleto 
Informativo" drafted in the Spanish language is the only official document, and no document other than the "Folleto Informativo"shall have 
any legal effect or be relied upon with regard to the Note Issue. 
 
70 
• 
Amortisation: on the first Payment Date, the loan will be amortised in an amount sufficient to 
equal the Outstanding Nominal Balance of the Subordinate Loan to the deficit amount resulting 
from the accrual and collection of the interest from the Shares and Certificates. Nevertheless, if 
this deficit is zero (because the Available Resources are sufficient to cancel it), this loan will be 
amortised in full. 
Participative Loan: 
• 
Amount: 20,000,000 Euros. The amount of the Loan will be used to establish the Reserve Fund. 
• 
Interest Rate: The remuneration of the Participative Loan will have two components, a fixed one 
equal to the interests accrued by the Outstanding Nominal Balance of the loan applying an interest 
rate equal to the Reference Interest Rate of the Bond during such period, plus a margin of 1%. 
And another component of a variable nature which will be determined in accordance with section 
V.3.3. of the Prospectus. 
• 
Amortisation: Amortisation of the Participative Loan will take place on each Payment Date for an 
amount equal to the amount in which the Required Minimum Level of the Reserve Fund is 
reduced on each Payment Date. 
Financial Swap 
The Fund will swap with the Seller the interest payments from the mortgage loans received on each 
liquidation period for an amount equal to the aggregate of the outstanding nominal balance of each 
Share and Certificate multiplied by the sum of 1) the Reference Interest Rate of the Bond plus 2) the 
Weighed Average Margin of the Bonds, plus 3) a margin of 0.67%. The swap will be settled by net 
difference. 
Reinvestment of the Flows: The flows received by the Fund (principal and interest of the Loan 
portfolios) will be reinvested at an interest rate equal to the interest reference rate of the Bonds plus 
the weighed average margin of the loans. 
Initial and Ordinary Expenses: On the first Payment Date, those derived from the constitution of the 
Fund and the issue of the Bonds. Additionally: Commission of the Sociedad Gestora. On each 
Payment Date a payment of ¼ of 0.01% of the Outstanding Nominal Balance to Maturity of the 
Shares and Certificates at the beginning of the corresponding Payment Date, with a minimum of  ¼ of 
30,000 €. Commission to be paid to the Financial Agent: on each Payment Date, the Financial Agent 
will receive a commission of ¼ of 0.00343 % of the Outstanding Nominal Balance to Maturity of the 
Shares and Certificates plus a fixed 4,721; other expenses: publication of advertisements, rating 
agencies and auditors.

The Seller will grant, in accordance with the Subordinated Loan Contract, a Subordinated Loan to the 
Fund (hereon, Subordinated Loan) for a total amount of 6,000,000 Euros. 
The amount of the Subordinated Loan will be advanced on the business day prior to the first Payment 
Date to the Fund’s Account opened at the Financial Agent. 
This amount will be used by the Sociedad Gestora to cover the difference, on the first Payment Date, 
between the interest accrued and the interest paid of the Shares and Certificates.

Bonds current at any time plus a margin of 0.75%. Payment of said interest will be subject to the 
priority order described in section V.4.2. of the Prospectus.  
The maturity of the Subordinated Loan will take place on the date of the extinction of the Fund. On 
the first Payment Date, the Subordinated Loan will be amortised in an amount sufficient to equal the 
Outstanding Nominal Balance of the Loan to the effective amount of the deficit between the accrual 
and collection of interest from the Shares and Certificates. Nevertheless, if this deficit is zero (because 
the Available Resources are sufficient to cancel it), this loan will be amortised in full. 
All the amounts to be paid to the Seller on account of both interest accrued and amortisation of 
principal accrued by the Subordinated Loan, will be subject to the Priority Order established in 
section V.4.2. of the Prospectus. 
All the amounts which as a consequence, have not been forwarded to the Seller will be paid on the 
following Payment Dates in which there are sufficient Available Resources to do so in the Priority 
Order established.  


This prospectus is a translation into English of the original "Folleto Informativo" drafted in Spanish language and registered with the 
"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores" (the Spanish Securities Market Commission, "CNMV") on March 8th, 2005. The "Folleto 
Informativo" drafted in the Spanish language is the only official document, and no document other than the "Folleto Informativo"shall have 
any legal effect or be relied upon with regard to the Note Issue. 
 
77 
Those amounts owed to the Seller and not paid in respect to what is established in the aforementioned 
sections, will not accrue penalty interest in its favour. 
V.3.2. Initial Expenses Loan 
The Seller will grant, in accordance with the Initial Expenses Loan Contract, a Subordinated Loan to 
the Fund (hereon, Initial Expenses Loan) for a maximum amount of 2,105,600 Euros. 
The final amount of the Loan for Initial Expenses will be determined by the Sociedad Gestora on March 
7, 2005, once the Placement Directors notify, as defined in section II.19.3., the underwriting commissions 
to be applied to the Bonds of each Series. The Sociedad Gestora will proceed, before 13:00 (CET), on 
March 7, 2005, to notify this final amount of the Initial Expenses Loan. The amount of the Initial 
Expenses Loan will be advanced on the Closing Date to the Fund’s Account opened at the Financial 
Agent. The final amount of the Loan will be included in the disbursement deed. 
The amount will be used by the Sociedad Gestora to pay the initial expenses of the Fund 
corresponding to the Bonds. 
The Initial Expenses Loan will accrue a variable interest rate equal to the Reference Interest Rate of 
the Bonds current at any time plus a margin of 0.75%. Payment of said interest will be subject to the 
priority order described in section V.4.2. of the Prospectus.  
The amortisation of the principal of the Initial Expenses Loan will be made in 20 equal and 
consecutive instalments, the first of which will take place on the first Payment Date (June 27, 2005) 
and the rest on the following Payment Dates, all in accordance with the Priority Order described in 
section V.4.2. of the Prospectus. 
All the amounts to be paid to the Seller, on account of both interest accrued and amortisation of 
principal accrued by the Initial Expenses Loan, will be subject to the Priority Order described in 
section V.4.2. of the Prospectus.  
All amounts, that with respect to the above sections, are not paid to the Seller will be effected on the 
following Payment Dates in which the Available Resources allow for such a payment in accordance 
with the established priority order. 
Those amounts owed to the Seller and not paid in respect to what is established in the aforementioned 
sections, will not accrue penalty interests in its favour. 
V.3.3. Participative Loan 
Caja de Ahorros del Mediterráneo will grant to the Fund, as is established in the Participative Loan 
Contract, a subordinated loan to the Fund (hereon, Participative Loan) destined for the initial 
establishment of the Reserve Fund, by the Sociedad Gestora 
The total amount of the Participative Loan will be 20,000,000 Euros. 
The amount of the Loan will be forwarded on the Closing Date to the Reinvestment Account. 
The amortisation of the Participative Loan will be made on each Payment Date for an amount equal to 
the amount in which, on each Payment Date, the Required Minimum Level of the Reserve Fund is 
reduced, all in accordance with the priority of payments established in section V.4.2. of the 
Prospectus.  


This prospectus is a translation into English of the original "Folleto Informativo" drafted in Spanish language and registered with the 
"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores" (the Spanish Securities Market Commission, "CNMV") on March 8th, 2005. The "Folleto 
Informativo" drafted in the Spanish language is the only official document, and no document other than the "Folleto Informativo"shall have 
any legal effect or be relied upon with regard to the Note Issue. 
 
78 
Due to the subordinated nature of the Participative Loan, in relation to the rest of the Fund’s 
obligations, and that its reimbursement depends on the performance of the Shares and Certificates, 
and the evolution of the interest rates paid to the Bonds issued by the Fund, the remuneration of the 
Participative Loan will have two components, one known and another one variable and related to the 
evolution of the risks of the Fund: 
(i) “Fixed Remuneration of Participative Loan”: the principal of the Participative Loan will accrue an 
annual interest calculated on the base of a variable interest rate equal to the reference interest rate of 
the Bond current at any time, in accordance with section II.10. of the Prospectus plus a margin of 1%. 
(ii) “Variable Remuneration of Participative Loan”, will be equal to the positive difference, on each 
Payment Date, between the Available Resources  and payments to be made by the Fund in accordance 
with the Priority Order established in section V.4.2.. 
The remuneration of the Participative Loan will be paid on each Payment Date, in accordance 
with the Priority Order of Payments established in section V.4.2.. 
Amounts due to the Seller from the fixed remuneration of the Participative Loan and not paid as a result 
of the above paragraphs will not accrue additional interest in its favour. 
V.3.4. Reserve Fund 
The Reserve Fund will be established as a guarantee mechanism and in order to allow payments by 
the Fund in accordance with the priority order established in section V.4.2. of the Prospectus. 
The Reserve Fund will be established on the Closing Date with charge to the Participative Loan, for 
and amount of 20,000,000 Euros. 
On each Payment Date, the Reserve Fund will be replenished until the Required Minimum Level of 
the Reserve Fund is reached, with the resources that, on each Payment Date, are available to such 
effect, in accordance with the priority order described in section V.4.2. of the Prospectus. 
The Required Minimum Level of the Reserve Fund will be the lesser of the following amounts: 
- 1% of the initial nominal balance of the Bonds at issuance. 
- 2% of the Outstanding Nominal Balance of the Bonds. 
No reduction of the Required Minimum Level of the Reserve Fund will be made when one of the 
following situations takes place: 
1) That the Reserve Fund did not reach its required level on the previous Payment Date. 
2) That the Outstanding Nominal Balance of the Shares and Certificates with arrears equal or above 
90 days, is above 1% of the Outstanding Nominal Balance of the Shares and Certificates. 
3) That 3 years have not elapsed since the Date of the Constitution of the Fund. 
In no case will the Required Minimum Level of the Reserve Fund be inferior to 0.50% of the initial 
nominal balance of the Bond issue. 
The balance of the Reserve Fund will be deposited at the Reinvestment’s Account and will benefit 
from the performance guarantees established in section V.3.5. of the Prospectus. 


This prospectus is a translation into English of the original "Folleto Informativo" drafted in Spanish language and registered with the 
"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores" (the Spanish Securities Market Commission, "CNMV") on March 8th, 2005. The "Folleto

79 
V.3.5. Deposit of the Resources of the Fund 
V.3.5.1. Reinvestment Account 
The Fund will have an account at the Seller, in accordance with Contrato de Depósito a Tipo de 
Interés Garantizado, into which shall be paid on each Collection Date, all the amounts that the Fund 
were to receive from the Seller. These amounts will take place on the 20th of each month or if such 
day is not a Business Day, the immediately prior Business Day, while the Seller maintains a short 
term rating of P1 (Moody’s) or F1 (Fitch), (its current rating is P1 and F1) or on a weekly basis when 
the rating falls below any of such ratings. 
The Seller will undertake the services of management and maintenance of the aforesaid account, in 
accordance with regular banking practice. Expenses generated from the maintenance of said account 
will be assigned to the Seller, except when the expenses arise as a result of the negligence of the 
Sociedad Gestora. 
The Seller will transfer to the Fund’s Account, value date the Business Day prior to each Payment 
Date, all the amounts to cover the payment obligations established in the Priority Order of Payments 
of section V.4.2. and which are deposited at the Reinvestment Account, upon receiving instructions 
from the Sociedad Gestora. These amounts will only correspond to the income forwarded by the 
Seller for the amounts collected from the Shares and Certificates it administers -in the three Collection 
Periods prior to each Payment Date-, the Technical Advance, Reserve Fund and the returns of such 
amounts. 
Positive balances of the Reinvestment Account will accrue an annual variable interest rate in favour of 
the Fund, equal to the Reference Interest Rate applicable to the Bonds, on the Payment Date in which 
said positive balances are considered Available Resources, plus the weighed average margin, in 
accordance with the following, and all in the terms established in the Contrato de Depósito a Tipo de 
Interés Garantizado. In this way, each transfer will evolve into a accountable term, lasting the number 
of days elapsing between the date value of the transfer (included) and the date until which the transfer 
to the Fund’s Account is made (excluded). Interest generated will be cleared the day before the date in 
which the transfer to the Fund’s Account must be made, and will be transferred with the rest of 
amounts on that day. 
The weighed average margin shall be equal to the amount resulting from dividing the sum of the 
Outstanding Nominal Balances of each Series of Bonds multiplied by their appropriate margins, and 
the Outstanding Nominal Balance of all the Bonds. 
The balances of the Reinvestment Account will be maintained in cash. Balances resulting from the 
Reinvestment Account, in favour of the Fund, will not be used, under any circumstance, by the Seller, 
to compensate any debt with the Fund or related third parties, except with prior written authorisation 
from the Sociedad Gestora. 
In the event that the rating of the Seller is downgraded by the Rating Agencies, to a rating inferior to 
P1 (Moody’s) or F1 (Fitch), or such rating is suspended by any of the Rating Agencies, the Seller will 
find, in the 30 days following such change, and in order to maintain the ratings for each Series, (i) an 
institution with both ratings mentioned above, to undertake, under the same conditions, the functions 
of the Seller in respect of the Reinvestment Account, or (ii) obtain a banking endorsement, from an 
institution with both ratings mentioned above, to guarantee to the Fund, upon request from the 
Sociedad Gestora, due payment by the Seller of its obligations of payment derived from the amounts 
deposited at the Reinvestment Account. In both cases, the amounts from Shares and Certificates from 
the Seller will be transferred to the Reinvestment Account on a weekly basis, but maintaining the 
transfer to the Fund’s Account on a quarterly basis.

80 
V.3.5.2. Fund’s Account 
The Fund will have at the Financial Agent, and in accordance with that established in the Financial 
Service Contract, a banking account in the name of the Fund (Fund’s Account). 
The Seller will transfer to the Fund’s Account, on the business day prior to each Payment Date, all the 
amounts mentioned in section V.3.5.1., prior instructions form the Sociedad Gestora. 
Net Amounts from the Financial Swap Contract in favour of the Fund will also be transferred to the 
Fund’s Account. 
Equally, on the Closing Date the Seller will transfer the final amount of the Initial Expenses Loan and, 
on the Business Day prior to the first Payment Date, the amount of the Subordinated Loan. 
Following instructions by the Sociedad Gestora, all necessary payments to satisfy the obligations of 
the Fund will be made through the Fund’s Account. 
The Fund’s Account will not have a negative balance. The balances of the Fund’s Account will be 
maintained in cash. 
Amounts deposited at the Fund’s Account will not accrued interest in favour of the Fund. 
In the event that the rating of the Financial Agent, given by the Rating Agencies for short term risk, is 
reduced to a rating bellow P1 (Moody’s) or F1 (Fitch) (the current rating is P1 and F1+), or is 
suspended for whatever reason by any of the Rating Agencies, the Sociedad Gestora will, in the 30 
days following such reduction, after prior consultation with the Rating Agencies, take one of the 
following decisions in order to maintain an adequate level of guarantee in respect of the compromises 
derived from the custody of the Shares and Certificates, Payment Agency and  maintenance of the 
Fund’s Account: 
(i) 
Obtain from a credit entity with a rating not inferior to P1 (Moody’s) or F1 (Fitch), or another 
equivalent rating expressly recognised by the Rating Agencies, a guarantee or similar 
obligation regarding the terms assumed by the Financial Agent. 
(ii) 
Replace the Financial Agent with another credit entity with a rating not inferior to P1 
(Moody’s) or F1 (Fitch), that will assume, under the same conditions, the functions of the 
Financial Agent. 
The Financial Agent will pay any expense derived from the development of the services 
undertaken in this contract. Notwithstanding the above, and in relation to the expenses 
considered external, they will be paid by the Financial Agent up to a maximum limit of 300.51 
Euros a year, the excess will be paid by the Fund. 
V.3.6. Technical Advance 
Taking into account that some of the delays in the payments made by the borrowers have an interim 
or technical nature, and with the objective of avoiding that such delays have a negative impact on the 
flow of payments to the Bondholders, and taking into account that there is a lapse of 20 days between 
the end of the Collection Period and the Collection Date on behalf of the Fund, and that the amounts 
collected by the Seller as Loan administrator are the property of the Fund, the Sociedad Gestora, on 
behalf of the Fund, will be entitled to receive on every Collection Date an advance backed by such 
amounts, which will be deposited in the Reinvestment Account.

"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores" (the Spanish Securities Market Commission, "CNMV") on March 8th, 2005. The "Folleto 
Informativo" drafted in the Spanish language is the only official document, and no document other than the "Folleto Informativo"shall have 
any legal effect or be relied upon with regard to the Note Issue. 
 
81 
The amount of the Technical Advance cannot exceed the amount collected by the Seller from the 
Mortgage Loans it administers, for any payment that the Fund will be entitled to as holder of the 
Shares and Certificates, from the end of the last Collection Period until the Collection Date on which 
the Technical Advance is requested. 
The Sociedad Gestora will calculate the Technical Advance as an amount equal to the sum of the 
amounts matured and not yet collected payments of such Mortgage Loans by the Seller during the 
previous Collection Period, for principal and interest from the Shares and Certificates in arrears of a 
maximum of 1 month, on the Collection Date on which the Technical Advance is requested, taking 
into account the limitations described in the previous paragraph. The Technical Advance will not be 
larger, in respect of each individual Mortgage Loan, to the interests and principal payable on the last 
instalment of such loan. 
On each Collection Date, the Technical Advance delivered on the previous Collection Date may be 
deducted from the amounts to be transferred, and a new Technical Advance corresponding to the 
following payment may be requested. 
V.3.7. Financial Interest Swap Contract 
The Sociedad Gestora will, on behalf of the Fund, sign with Caja de Ahorros del Mediterráneo a 
Financial Interest Swap Contract (hereon Swap) described in this section, where: 
This agreement derives from the need, on the one hand, to eliminate the risk of the interest rate which 
takes place as a result of the Shares and Certificates being affected to variable interest rates with 
changing reference rates and revision periods, and the liquidation of variable interest established for 
each Series of Bonds; and on the other, to the risk of, following the legislation on modifying and 
subrogation mortgage loans, the Shares and Certificates being renegotiated to diminish the agreed 
interest rate. 
Party A: The Sociedad Gestora, on behalf of the Fund. 
Party B: Caja de Ahorros del Mediterráneo. 
V.3.7.1. Liquidation Dates 
Liquidation Dates will coincide with the Payment Dates of the Bonds, that is March, June, September 
and December 26th of each year, or in the event that such dates are not Business Days, on the 
immediately following Business Day. The first Payment Date of the Fund shall be June 27, 2005. 
V.3.7.2. Liquidation Periods 
Liquidation Periods shall be the days elapsed between consecutive Liquidation Dates, including the 
first and excluding the last day of such period. Exceptionally, the first Liquidation Period will have a 
duration equivalent to the days elapsed between the Closing Date of the Bond’s Issue (included) and 
June 27, 2005 (excluded). 
V.3.7.3. Amounts to be paid by Party A 
Sum of all the amounts of interest from the Shares and Certificates paid by the debtors in the 3 
preceding Collection Periods immediately before the current Payment Date and which will correspond 
to those effectively been transferred to the Fund. Exceptionally, the first Swap liquidation date will 
have three Collection Periods but the first one will have a duration below the calendar month.

"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores" (the Spanish Securities Market Commission, "CNMV") on March 8th, 2005. The "Folleto 
Informativo" drafted in the Spanish language is the only official document, and no document other than the "Folleto Informativo"shall have 
any legal effect or be relied upon with regard to the Note Issue. 
 
82 
V.3.7.4. Amounts to be Paid by Party B 
On each Liquidation Date of the Swap Contract, Party B will pay the Amount to be Paid by Party B 
that will be equal to the result of the recalculation of the payments of interests that compose the 
Amount to be Paid by Party A, wich will be paid on the same date on wich the Amount to be paid by 
Party B will be paid. 
This recalculation will be the substitution of the rate effectively applied to each Share or Certificate 
by the Interest Rate of Party B. The Interest Rate of Party B shall be equal to the Reference Interest 
Rate of the Bonds for the current Interest Accrual Period, plus the average margin of the Bonds 
weighed by the Outstanding Nominal Balance of the Bonds on the Determination Date prior to the 
current Payment Date, plus 0.67%. 
Payments (or collections) to be made as a result of the Swap contract will be carried out on each 
Payment Date for their net amounts, that is, the positive difference (or negative) between the amount 
to be paid by Party A and the amount to be paid by Party B (hereon, Net Amount). Payments to be 
made by Party A will follow the Priority Order of Payments of section V.4.2.. 
V.3.7.5. Swap Contract breaches 
If, on a Liquidation Date, the Fund does not pay the amount due to Party B, the Financial Interest 
Swap Contract would be terminated in favour of Party B. In the event of paying a liquidation amount, 
the Fund will assume, if applicable, the obligation to pay the amount established in the Financial 
Interest Swap Contract, and all in accordance with the priority order of payments.  
If, on a Payment Date, Party B does not honour its partial or full obligation to pay the amount due to 
the Fund, the Sociedad Gestora may terminate the Swap Contract. In this event, (i) Party B will 
assume the obligation to pay the liquidation amount established in the contract, and (ii) the amounts to 
be paid by the Fund to Party B, in accordance with the Swap Contract, will be paid in accordance with 
the Priority Order of Payments of the Fund. 
The liquidation amount will be calculated by the Sociedad Gestora, as Swap calculation agent, based 
on the market value of the Financial Interest Swap Contract. 
Without prejudice to the above, except in a permanent alteration of the financial balance of the Fund, 
the Sociedad Gestora, on behalf of the Fund, will try to arrange a new Swap Contract. 
V.3.7.6. Rating modifications assumptions 
Caja de Ahorros del Mediterráneo will assume the compromise of, if at any moment during the life of 
the Bonds, the rating for non-subordinated and non-guaranteed debt of Party B falls below A1, for 
Moody’s long term risk, or A for long-term risk and/or F1 for short-term risk for Fitch, or such rating 
is, for whatever reason, suspended by any Rating Agencies, the Seller will undertake the irrevocable 
compromise of, in the 30 days elapsing from the event of such circumstance, carrying out one of the 
following options, in the terms and conditions the Sociedad Gestora deems appropriate, and prior 
notification to the Rating Agencies, in order to maintain the ratings assigned by such Rating 
Agencies:

83 
1) Allow a third entity with a rating for non-subordinated and non-guaranteed rate equal or higher 
than A1, for Moody’s long-term risk, and A for long-term and F1 for short-term risk for Fitch, 
respectively, to guarantee the contractual obligations;  
2) Allow a third entity with the same ratings required in 1) above, to carry out the contractual 
obligations and replaces it, before the Swap Contract is cancelled for Party B, or, in its case, in 
virtue of the new Swap Contract; or  
3) to make a deposit in cash or in securities in favor of the Fund, in an account in other entity with a 
rating equal to P-1 for short-term debt on the Moody’s rating scale and F1 on Fitch’s rating scale 
to secure performance of Party B’s contractual obligations and in an amount based on the Swap 
reinstatement as not to affect negatively the rating assigned to the Bonds. In addition, if applicable 
and depending on the rating assigned to the counterparty of the Swap Contract, this option will be 
inmediately performed as long as option (i) or option (ii) above is not implemented. 
All costs, expenses and taxes will be borne by Party B. 
V.3.7.7. Maturity of the Contract 
The early termination of the Swap Contract will not constitute in itself an early amortisation or the 
liquidation of the Fund, unless the termination occurs in conjunction with other events or 
circumstances related to the capital resources of the Fund, producing a substantial or permanent 
change affecting the financial survival of the Fund. 
The maturity of the Swap Contract will be the earlier of the Legal Maturity Date of the Fund or on the 
Payment Date on which the Bonds are redeemed in full.

CHAPTER VII 
MARKET CONSIDERATIONS  
VII.1  Recent and Significant Trends of the Mortgage Market in General and of the 
Mortgage Loans and Bond Markets in Particular 
In recent years credit assets with mortgage guarantees included in the balance sheet of Spanish credit 
entities have become the main protagonists of the Securitization processes of the Spanish financial 
system. 
On the one hand, the existence of a critical mass with sufficient size within a subgroup of this type of 
mortgage assets has been critical: mortgage loans to private individuals to finance the acquisition, 
construction or restoration of properties. On the other, the contribution has come from the decisive way in 
which this type of financing has several homogeneous characteristics from a legal and financial point of 
view. The new legislation arising from the Ministerial Order of May 5th, 1994, regarding the transparency 
of the financial conditions of the mortgage loans, and its subsequent development in the Bank of Spain 
Circular 5/94 of July 22nd has been one of the elements that has strengthened this homogeneity. 
Secondly, it is worth noting that in recent years the competition within the Spanish mortgage market has 
intensified, once private individuals and credit entities have assumed the tools outlined by Law 2/94 of 
March 30th, regarding subrogation and modification of the mortgage loans. The influence of the reform of 
taxation related to mortgage cancellation must also be taken into account; as its inevitable influence in the 
rates of mortgage prepayment. 
VII.2 
Implications Derived from those Trends Mentioned in the Previous Section 
The total amount of Mortgage Loans participated by the Shares and Certificates grouped in the Fund, 
carry a variable interest rate (some of the loans will have accrued during an initial period at a fixed rate); 
such rates are modified periodically by variations in the interest rates of the market. Therefore, it is 
unlikely that a substantial increase of the Prepayment Rates of the portfolio will occur. 
Notwithstanding the above, the average term and the duration of the Bond Issue referred to in the 
Prospectus could change in relation to those initially estimated in section II.11. in the event that the Rate 
of Prepayment of the Shares and Certificates, varies. 
The Sociedad Gestora publishes monthly, through various channels including its web page (www.tda-
sgft.com), the Prepayment Rates of each one of the Funds it manages. Additionally, it is the opinion of 
the Sociedad Gestora that in the coming years there will be relevant information available regarding the 
behaviour of Prepayment Rates. Nevertheless, it must be taken into account that the market, as indicated 
in the previous section, has suffered in recent years and has continued to experience radical changes, and 
such event do not recommend, for the time being, the elaboration of predictions based on the 
extrapolation of available data from the last years; furthermore this data is scarce and limited in scope and 
length, and it is not possible to assign them any meaningful value. In any event, those investors interested 
can consult the information that the Sociedad Gestora publishes regularly on the Mortgage Backed 
Securities and the Asset Backed Securities Funds that it manages.
