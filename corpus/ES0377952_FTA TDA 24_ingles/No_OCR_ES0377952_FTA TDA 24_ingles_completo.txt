RISK FACTORS 
1. RISKS DERIVING FROM THE LEGAL STATUS AND BUSINESS OF THE 
FUND 
1.1. 
Nature of the Fund and obligations of the Sociedad Gestora  
The Fund will constitute a separate fund without legal status that, pursuant to Royal Decree 
926/1998, will be serviced by a management company (hereinafter "Sociedad Gestora"). The Fund 
will only be liable for its obligations vis-à-vis its creditors with its assets. 
The Sociedad Gestora will perform for the Fund those duties attributed to it in Royal Decree 
926/1998, as well as safeguarding the interests of the Security holders as the manager of third 
party funds, without there being any syndicate of Security holders. Therefore the capacity to 
defend the Security holders' interests depends on the means and resources of the Sociedad Gestora. 
1.2. 
Mandatory substitution of the Sociedad Gestora 
In accordance with article 19 of Royal Decree 926/1998, if the Sociedad Gestora is declared 
insolvent, without prejudice to the effects of such insolvency as described below, it will find 
another sociedad gestora to substitute it. Whenever in the circumstances envisaged, four (4) 
months have elapsed since the event requiring the substitution occurs and a new sociedad gestora 
that is prepared to take over the management has not been found, the Fund will be liquidated early 
and the securities it has issued will be redeemed, in accordance with the provisions of the Articles 
of Incorporation and this Prospectus. 
1.3. 
Insolvency of the Sociedad Gestora 
The insolvency of any of the parties involved (whether it be either of the Sellers, the Sociedad 
Gestora or any other counterparty of the Fund) could affect their contractual relations with the 
Fund as provided in the Ley Concursal 22/2003 of 9 July (Spanish Insolvency Act - the “Ley 
Concursal”). 
In this respect, if the Sociedad Gestora is declared bankrupt, it must be substituted by another 
Sociedad Gestora in accordance with the provisions of the previous section of this Prospectus. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of the insolvency of the Sociedad Gestora, any assets 
of the Fund that are in the possession of the Sociedad Gestora and with respect whereto the latter 
has no right of use, surety or retention -except for money due to its fungible nature- and that form 
part of the latter's assets will be construed as belonging to the Fund, and the receivers in 
bankruptcy must deliver them at the Fund's request. Due to the nature of the asset securitization 
operation in question, and except in the event of a breach by the parties, no cash amounts will 
become part of the assets of the Sociedad Gestora because the amounts that constitute the revenues 
of the Fund must be deposited, in the terms set forth in the Articles of Incorporation and in the 
Prospectus, in the accounts opened on behalf of the Fund by the Sociedad Gestora (which is 
involved in opening such accounts not only as the agent of the Fund, but as its legal representative.  
Therefore the Fund would be entitled to absolute separation in this respect, in the terms set forth in 
articles 80 and 81 of the Ley Concursal). 
In the event of the insolvency of an Seller, the issue and assignment of the respective 
Participations and Certificates may be returned only if an action for such return is pursued in

"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores" (the Spanish Securities Market Commission, "CNMV") on November 25h, 2005. The "Folleto 
Informativo" drafted in the Spanish language is the only official document, and no document other than the "Folleto Informativo"shall have 
any legal effect or be relied upon with regard to the Note Issue.

which fraud is demonstrated to have existed in that issue and assignment in accordance with the 
provisions of the paragraph 4 of the Fifth Additional Provision of Ley 3/1994. 
In the event that one of the Sellers is declared insolvent under the Ley Concursal, the Fund, acting 
through the Sociedad Gestora, will be entitled to separation with respect to the multiple securities 
representing the Participations and the Certificates that it has issued, in the terms set forth in 
articles 80 and 81 of the Ley Concursal. Furthermore the Fund, acting through its Sociedad 
Gestora, will be entitled to secure from the Seller in question the amounts derived from the 
Participations and the Certificates that it has issued, because such amounts will be construed as the 
property of the Fund and, therefore, must be transferred to the Sociedad Gestora on behalf of the 
Fund. Nevertheless, it might not be possible to exercise such separation right with respect to the 
funds handled by the Seller in question, for the account and pursuant to the orders of the Fund, in 
its duty of managing the collection of the Mortgage Loans that it services and the money on 
deposit, if any, in the Reinvestment Account opened by such Seller, in both cases as at the date the 
insolvency was declared, due to the fungible nature of money and the consequent confusion of 
assets. The mechanisms available for mitigating such risk are described in sections 3.4.4.3. 
(Reinvestment Accounts), 3.4.5. (How payments are collected in respect of the assets) and 3.7.1. 
(Servicing and custody of the Mortgage Loans) of the Additional Building Block. 
1.4. 
Restricted actions against the Sociedad Gestora 
The Security holders and remaining ordinary creditors of the Fund will have no recourse against 
the Sociedad Gestora, other than from non-performance of its duties or non-compliance with the 
provisions of the Articles of Incorporation and this Prospectus.   
2. RISK DERIVED FROM THE SECURITIES 
2.1. 
Liquidity 
There is no guarantee that a minimum volume or frequency of Security transactions will be 
forthcoming in the market. 
There is no commitment that any entity will intervene in the secondary market, providing liquidity 
to the Securities by offering itself as counterparty. 
Furthermore, under no circumstances will the Fund be able to repurchase the Securities from their 
holders, although the Bonds can be redeemed early in full in the case of early liquidation, under 
the terms established in section 4.4.3. of the Registration Document. 
2.2. 
Rate of Return of the Securities 
The calculation of the internal rate of return (IRR) for the holder of each Security that is stipulated 
in section 4.10. of the Securities Note, is subject, inter alia, to future market interest rates, given 
the floating nature of the Nominal Interest Rate of each Series, and to early redemption and default 
rate hypotheses that might not be fulfilled. 
2.3. 
Duration of the Securities 
The calculation of the average life of the Bonds of each Series and of the duration of the Securities 
mentioned in section 4.10. of the Securities Note is subject, inter alia, to Credit Right early 
redemption and default rate hypotheses that might not be fulfilled. Fulfilment of the early

Informativo" drafted in the Spanish language is the only official document, and no document other than the "Folleto Informativo"shall have 
any legal effect or be relied upon with regard to the Note Issue. 
 
8 
redemption rate is influenced by a variety of demographic, economic and social factors, such as 
seasonality, market interest rates, the employment and financial situation of the Mortgagors and 
the general state of the economy, that make this unpredictable. 
2.4. 
Default interest 
Under no circumstances will the delay of the payment of interest or repayment of principal to the 
Security holders give rise to accrual of default interest in their favour.  
3. RISKS DERIVED FROM THE ASSETS BACKING THE ISSUE 
3.1. 
Risk of default on the Mortgage Loans 
The Holders of the Securities issued by the Fund will bear the risk of default on the Mortgage 
Loans pooled in the Fund through the issue of the Participations and the Certificates, always taking 
into account the protection offered by the credit enhancement mechanisms referred to in section 
3.4.2. of the Additional Building Block. 
The Sellers, in accordance with article 348 of the Commercial Code, will only be held liable vis-à-
vis the Fund for the existence and legitimacy of the Mortgage Loans, and of the Participations and 
Certificates that they have issued, in the terms and conditions declared in the Articles of 
Incorporation and that are set forth in this Prospectus, as well as for the legal status with which 
they carry out the transfer. However, they will not assume any liability for the non-payment by the 
Mortgagors, be it of the principal, of the interest or any other amount they may owe by virtue of 
the Mortgage Loans. Nor will they assume, in any other form, liability for directly or indirectly 
guaranteeing the successful outcome of the transaction, nor will they grant guarantees or 
endorsements, nor will they be party to repurchase agreements relating to the Participations and 
the Certificates, either by virtue of the Articles of Incorporation, this Prospectus, or of any other 
agreement or contract. All of this, without prejudice to the Sellers being held liable for the 
replacement of the respective Participations and/or Certificates issued by each one that do not 
conform to the declarations set forth in section 2.2.8. of the Additional Building Block, in relation 
to the commitments given in sections 2.2.9 and 3.7.1. of the Additional Building Block. 
The Securities issued by the Fund do not represent or constitute an obligation of the Sellers or of 
the Sociedad Gestora. No other guarantees have been granted by any public or private entities, 
including the Sellers, the Sociedad Gestora, and any other firm affiliated with or invested in by any 
of the above. 
3.2. 
Limited protection 
An investment in the Securities may be affected, inter alia, by a worsening of the general 
economic conditions that have a negative effect on the payments of the Mortgage Loans that back 
the Fund issue. In the event that the level of Mortgage Loan default becomes high, the limited 
protection against Mortgage Loan portfolio loss afforded to the Securities as a result of the 
existence of the credit enhancement transactions described under section 3.4.2. of the Additional 
Building Block could be reduced, or even exhausted.  
Similarly, the degree of subordination of the Security interest payments and repayment of principal 
among the Bonds of the different Series that arises from their ranking in the Payment Priority 
Order constitutes a differentiated protection mechanism between the different Securities. 


This prospectus is a translation into English of the original "Folleto Informativo" drafted in Spanish language and registered with the 
"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores" (the Spanish Securities Market Commission, "CNMV") on November 25h, 2005. The "Folleto 
Informativo" drafted in the Spanish language is the only official document, and no document other than the "Folleto Informativo"shall have 
any legal effect or be relied upon with regard to the Note Issue. 
 
9 
3.3. 
Risk of early redemption of the Mortgage Loans 
The Participations and the Certificates pooled in the Fund may be prepaid when the Mortgagors 
prepay the outstanding principal of the Mortgage Loans, in the terms set forth in each Mortgage 
Loan deed. Similarly, the Participations and the Certificates will be redeemed in full if that Seller 
is replaced in the related Mortgage Loans by another financial institution duly authorised for such 
purpose, subject to the Ley 2/1994 sobre subrogación y modificación de préstamos hipotecarios 
(Act 2/1994, of 30 March, on the subrogation and amendment of mortgages loans), in its current 
wording, or for any other reason having the same effect.  
The risk of such early redemption will be transferred on each Payment Date to the Security holders 
in accordance with the repayment rules set forth in section 4.9. of the Securities Note. 
Consequently, there may be changes in the repayment of the Bonds with respect to the amounts 
initially scheduled for each Payment Date.  
3.4. 
Seller NPL Ratios 
According to the financial information selected from section 3.5. of the Additional Building Block, 
as at 30 September 2005, the NPL Ratio is 0.63%, 1.17% and 3.75% for Caja Castilla La Mancha, 
Credifimo and Bankpime respectively, and the NPL Coverage Ratio is 321.39%, 82.32% and 
74.54% for Caja Castilla La Mancha, Credifimo and Bankpime respectively.

2.2. 
Accounting principles used by the Fund 
The Fund will report income and expense in accordance with the accrual principle, that is, on the 
basis of the actual flows represented by those revenues and expenses, regardless of when they are 
collected and paid. 
a) Participations and Certificates subscribed by the Fund: the Participations and the Certificates 
have been recorded under the assets of the Fund at their face value, which is the same as their 
acquisition cost. 
The interest on the Participations and the Certificates is recorded in the income statement in 
accordance with the accrual principle. 
The due but unpaid interest on defaulted Mortgage Loan Participations and Certificates is recorded 
as an asset on the balance sheet. 
The interest due and the outstanding principal of the defaulted Mortgage Loan Participations and 
Certificates is recorded as an asset, except whenever it can be demonstrated that the mortgaged 
property is insufficient guarantee. 
b) Bonds issued: the Bonds are recorded as a liability on the Fund balance sheet, at an amount 
equal to their redemption value.  
The interest payable on the Bonds is recorded in the income statement on a cumulative basis, and 
the part of them that has been accumulated in line with the accrual principle that is due but remains 
unpaid is recorded in the related liabilities account. 
c) IO Securities: the subscription price of each security, adjusted from time to time by the IO 
Payments until such time, will be recorded as a liability of the Fund. 
d) Fund Accounts: Fund liquidity accounts maintained by the Paying Agent and, where applicable, 
by the Rated Sellers, with predefined reinvestment mechanisms. 
The balance of the accounts will be recorded as an asset of the Fund, while the income and 
expenses of such accounts form part of the income and expenses of the Fund. 
e) Operating expenses, fees and remuneration: all the fees and expenses are deductible in their 
accrual period. The Fund Incorporation and Securities Issue Expenses detailed in section 0. of the 
Securities Note will be written off by the straight-line method over twenty (20) consecutive 
Payment Dates, starting on 22 March 2006. 
e) Technical Advances: on each Calculation Date, the Technical Advance obtained on the previous 
Calculation Date is considered deductible in the settlement of the Calculation Period that is being 
settled, and another Technical Advance may be requested and charged to the next settlement. 
f) Initial Expenses Loan: if the Initial Expenses Loan is used, pursuant to the provisions of section 
3.4.3.2. of the Additional Building Block, the interest on the Initial Expenses Loan will be 
recorded in each period in accordance with the accrual criteria. 
g) Derivative Contracts: Derivative Contracts serve to cover the interest rate risk to which the 
Fund is exposed on account of the difference between the reference interest rates of its assets and 
liabilities. The proceeds of these Contracts are recorded in the income statement symmetrically to 
the proceeds of the covered elements. 
Accounting period: the accounting periods of the Fund will start on 1 January and end on 31 
December each year, except the first accounting period, which will start on the Date of 
Incorporation, and the last accounting period, which will end on the date that the Fund is 
extinguished.

"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores" (the Spanish Securities Market Commission, "CNMV") on November 25h, 2005. The "Folleto

4.4.2. 
Length of life of the Fund 
The length of life of the Fund will run from the Date of Incorporation stipulated in the 
previous section until the legal maturity date (scheduled for 22 June 2040 and if this day 
is not a Business Day, the next Business Day), (the “Legal Maturity Date”), unless 
beforehand the Fund is liquidated in advance in accordance with the provisions of the 
next section). 
4.4.3. 
Early liquidation and extinction of the Fund 
Notwithstanding the above, pursuant to the future provisions of the Articles of 
Incorporation and the provisions of this Prospectus, the Sociedad Gestora will be 
authorised to proceed to carry out the early liquidation of the Fund and hence the early 
redemption of the Bonds, when on a Payment Date (as such is defined in section 4.8.1. of 
the Securities Note) the sum of the Outstanding Nominal Balance of the Participations 
and Certificates is less than 10% of the original balance thereof, and provided that (i) the 
authorization necessary to do so has been obtained from the competent authorities; and 
(ii) the liquidation of the Participations and the Certificates pending repayment, together 
with the balance that exists at that time in the Fund Accounts (Treasury Account, 
Collection Account, Liquidity Line Sinking Account and, where applicable, in the 
Reinvestment Accounts and in the Treasury Surplus Account), permits the full repayment 
of all the outstanding obligations vis-à-vis the Security holders, in accordance with the 
provisions of this section, and respecting any prior payments that are to be given priority, 
in accordance with the Payment Priority Order. 
It is understood, in all cases, that payment obligations derived from the Securities on the 
Early Liquidation Date mean the Receivable Nominal Balance of the Securities on that 
date, plus the unpaid accrued interest to that date, amounts that to all legal effects will be 
deemed at that date past due and payable. 
The Fund will be extinguished following the liquidation of the remaining assets, in any 
event, in the following circumstances, and the CNMV and the Rating Agencies will be 
informed beforehand if any of them occur: 
(i) 
When, in the opinion of the Sociedad Gestora, exceptional circumstances occur 
which make it impossible, or extremely difficult, to maintain the financial balance of 
the Fund.  
(ii) In the event that the Sociedad Gestora is declared bankrupt and the time limit 
established by law for such purposes, or else four months, have elapsed without a 
new sociedad gestora having been designated according to the provisions of section 
3.7.2.2. of the Additional Building Block. 
 (iii) When there occurs a non-payment indicative of a serious and permanent imbalance 
in relation to the securities issued or it is foreseen that it is going to occur.  
(iv) When there is a change in the tax regulations, in accordance with the regulations 
applicable to the Fund and to the Securities that, in the opinion of the Sociedad 
Gestora, has a significant and negative effect on the financial balance of the Fund. 
(v) When thirty (30) months elapse since the date of maturity of the last Mortgage Loan 
pooled in the Fund, even if debits remain unpaid. 
The Fund will be extinguished, in any event, as a result of the following circumstances:

(i) 
When the Participations and the Certificates are repaid in full. In the event that all 
the Participations and the Certificates have matured and amounts thereof remain to 
be collected and obligations remain to be paid to the Security holders, the Fund will 
be extinguished on the Payment Date immediately after thirty-six (36) months 
elapse since the date of maturity of the last Mortgage Loan pooled in the Fund, that 
is to say, 22 June 2040. 
(ii) When the Securities issued are repaid in full. 
(iii) In the event that one of the provisional ratings assigned to the Securities by the 
Rating Agencies is not confirmed before the start of the Security subscription 
period, which will start at 10:00 hours (CET time) on 30 November 2005 and will 
end at 10:00 hours (CET time) on 1 December 2005 (the “Subscription Period”), as 
well as when, before the start of the said Subscription Period, in the case of an event 
that could not be foreseen or that, despite being foreseeable, could not be avoided 
and makes it impossible to perform the Fund's Contracts pursuant to the provisions 
of section 1,105 of the Civil Code. In these cases, the incorporation of the Fund, the 
issue and subscription of the Participations and the Certificates, the Initial Expenses 
Loan Contract, the Liquidity Line, the Derivative Contracts, as well as any other 
contracts entered into by the Fund and the issue of the securities will be deemed 
rescinded. 
 
In this event of the early termination of the Fund, the Sellers will undertake to meet 
any initial expenses that may have been incurred in incorporating the Fund, each one 
paying a percentage equivalent to its percentage participation in the issue of 
Mortgage Participations and Mortgage Transfer Certificates and taking into account 
any expenses that can attributed individually to each one of them, pursuant to the 
provisions of the Internal Management Contract.  
In the event that, at the time of the final liquidation of the Fund, any obligations remain to 
be paid by the Fund to any of the Security holders, the Sociedad Gestora will proceed in 
one of the following ways: 
(i) 
It will proceed to sell the assets, for which purpose it will obtain bids from at least 
five (5) of the entities that deal most actively in these assets that, in its opinion, can 
give a market value. The starting price for the sale of all the Participations and 
Certificates will not be less than the sum of (a) the Outstanding Nominal Balance of 
the Participations and the Certificates plus (b) the accrued and uncollected interest of 
the Mortgage Loans to which they correspond. However, the Sociedad Gestora will 
be obliged to accept the best bid received for the assets made by such entities that 
meet the market value of the asset in question. In order to establish the market value, 
the Sociedad Gestora may request any valuation reports that it deems necessary. The 
names of the independent experts appointed will be reported to the CNMV and the 
Rating Agencies. 
In the event that the Fund is liquidated and any amount of the Participations and 
Certificates remains unredeemed, the Sellers will have a right of pre-emption to 
recover from the Fund the Participations and Certificates that they have issued, in 
the terms and conditions specified by the Sociedad Gestora and pursuant to the 
provisions of the previous paragraph. The foregoing right of pre-emption does not, 
under any circumstances, imply an agreement or declaration to repurchase the 
Participations and Certificates issued by the Sellers. The Sellers will have five (5) 
Business Days, counted from the date on which the Sociedad Gestora notifies them 
of the terms and conditions in which is will proceed to dispose of the Participations

and Certificates, to exercise the said right of pre-emption, and must at least match 
the best bid made by third parties; 
(ii) Proceed to terminate any contracts that are not deemed necessary for the Fund 
liquidation process;  
(iii) Should that be insufficient or should loans or other assets remain, it will proceed to 
sell the other assets held by the Fund. The Sociedad Gestora will be authorised to 
accept any bids that, in its opinion, meet the market value of the asset in question 
and are paid in cash. In order to establish the market value, the Sociedad Gestora 
may request the valuation reports it considers necessary. 
(iv) The Sociedad Gestora, after allocating the liquidation expenses reserve, will apply 
all the amounts that it obtains through the disposal of the assets of the Fund, together 
with the rest of the Available Resources that the Fund might have at that time, to the 
payment of the different items, in accordance with the Payment Priority Order.  
In the event that, once the Fund has been liquidated and all the payments set forth in 
section 3.4.6.2. of the Additional Building Block have been made, there is any remainder, 
such remainder will be paid to the Seller or Sellers in question. In the event that the 
remainder is not a liquid amount and consists of Participations and/or Certificates from 
Mortgage Loans that are pending rulings with respect to court or notarial proceedings 
initiated as a result of by Mortgagor default, both their continuation and the outcome of 
the ruling will be in favour of the Sellers in question. 
In any event, the Sociedad Gestora, acting on behalf of and for the account of the Fund, 
will not proceed to extinguish the Fund and to cancel its registration in the pertinent 
administrative registries until it has sold the remaining assets of the Fund and distributed 
the Available Funds, following the Payment Priority Order, except for the reserve to be 
allocated to pay the fund extinction expenses. 
Six (6) months after the liquidation of the remaining assets of the Fund and the 
distribution of the available funds, the Sociedad Gestora will grant a notary deed 
declaring (i) the extinction of the Fund, and the reasons, as set forth in the Articles of 
Incorporation and in this Prospectus, for the termination, (ii) the procedure for followed in 
notifying the Security holders and the CNMV, and (iii) the distribution of the Available 
Funds in the Payment Priority Order. This deed will be submitted by the Sociedad 
Gestora to the CNMV.

4.6. 
Fund tax system 
There follows a brief summary of the general tax regulations applicable to the Fund. This must be 
construed without prejudice to the particular nature of each local jurisdiction and of the regulations 
which may apply at the time the relevant income is obtained or declared. 
The tax regime applicable to Fondos de Titulización de Activos (Asset Securitization Funds) 
consists of the general provisions contained in Legislative Royal Decree 4/2004 of 5 March 
approving the consolidated text of Corporate Income Tax (Impuesto sobre Sociedades) and its 
implementing provisions, with the specific peculiarities arising from the provisions of Act 19/1992 
of 7 July regulating Sociedades y Fondos de Inversión Inmobiliaria y sobre Fondos de Titulización 
Hipotecaria (Real Estate Investment Funds and Companies and Mortgage Backed Securitization 
Funds - “Ley 19/1992”), in Act 3/1994 of 14 April, adapting Spanish legislation on credit 
institutions to the Second Directive on Banking Coordination and introducing other changes 
regarding the financial system (“Ley 3/1994”) and in Royal Decree 926/1998 which, in summary, 
define the following fundamental principles: 
1) 
Asset Securitization Funds are liable to Corporate Income Tax, subject to the general 
rules for determining the tax base, and to the general rate of 35 percent, and to the 
common rules for deductions, set-off of losses and other substantive elements of the tax. 
2) 
Investment income from Securitization Funds is subject to the general rules on 
withholdings on account of Corporate Income Tax, with the particularity that article 57-
k of the Regulations approved by Royal Decree 1777/2004, of 30 July stipulates that 
withholding does not apply to “income from mortgage participating units, mortgage 
loans and other credit rights that constitute revenue items for Securitization Funds". 
Consequently, in addition to the income from the directly securitised Participations and 
Certificates, the withholding exemption also extends, according to the expressly stated 
policy of the tax administration, to the income of the Mortgage Loans, insofar as they 
form part of the ordinary business activity of the said funds. 
3) 
Article 5.10 of Ley 19/1992 provides that the formation of mortgage securitization funds 
is exempt from classification as “corporate operations”, from Stamp Duty and from 
Real Estate Transfer Tax, thereby predetermining its submission to the same. 
The transfer to the Fund of the Participations and the Certificates stipulated in the 
Articles of Incorporation as described above is a transaction that is subject to but 
exempt from Value Added Tax (“VAT”), pursuant to the provisions of article 
20.One.18-e of the Value Added Tax Act 37/1992 of 28 December (“Ley del IVA”). 
The establishment and assignment of guarantees is subject to the general tax regime 
with no exceptions. 
4) 
In relation to Value Added Tax, the Fund will be subject to the general rules, with the 
sole particularity that the services provided for the Fund by the Sociedad Gestora will be 
exempt from Value Added Tax, and from Stamp Duty.

The Securities Issue will be exempt from VAT (article 20.One.18 of Ley del IVA) and 
Capital Transfer Tax and Stamp Duty (Impuesto sobre Transmisiones Patrimoniales y 
Actos Jurídicos Documentados) (article 45-I.B number 15 of the Consolidated Text of

The redemption price of each Bond will be one hundred thousand (100,000.00) euros, 
equivalent to its face value. The NAS-IO Securities will be redeemed through the NAS-
IO Payment in the terms set forth in section 4.8. of the Securities Note. In other words, 
the holders of the NAS-IO Securities are not entitled to reimbursement of the subscription 
price, but only the right to collect, until it matures, the NAS-IO Payment, always subject 
to the Payment Priority Order.

Description of the rights attached to the securities 
Pursuant to current legislation, the Securities detailed in the present Securities Note will offer no 
future or present voting right to the investor over the Fund or its Sociedad Gestora. 
The Investor's economic and financial rights associated with the acquisition and ownership of the 
Securities will be those derived from the interest rates, yields and redemption prices with which 
the Securities are issued and which are detailed in sections 4.8. and 4.9. infra in this Securities 
Note. 
The Security holders are subject, with respect to the payment of interest and repayment of the 
principal and to the NAS-IO Payments, to the Payment Priority Order. 
The Security holders will have no recourse against the Sociedad Gestora, other than from non-
performance of its duties or non-compliance with the provisions of this Prospectus, of the Articles 
of Incorporation and the applicable laws and regulations. 
Any dispute regarding the Fund that may arise during its operations or liquidation, be it amongst 
the Security holders or between the latter and the Sociedad Gestora, will be submitted to the courts 
and tribunals of Spain, with waiver of any other jurisdiction to which the parties may be entitled. 
4.8. 
The nominal interest rate and provisions relating to interest payable 
Interest on the Securities 
All the Bonds issued will accrue a nominal, annual and quarterly-variable interest on the 
Outstanding Nominal Balance of the Bonds on each Payment Date, and payable each quarter 
(“Nominal Interest Rate”), from the Disbursement Date and until they are fully redeemed, while 
the NAS-IO Securities will accrue a fixed interest calculated on their notional amount, as 
explained below. The interest of the Bonds, whatever their Class and Series, and the NAS-IO 
Payments will be payable at the end of each quarter on each Payment Date.  
The interest of the Securities will be paid, in relation to the other Fund payments, in the Payment 
Priority Order set forth in section 3.4.6. of the Additional Building Block.  
For interest accrual purposes, the Securities issue will be divided into successive interest accrual 
periods (hereinafter, “Interest Accrual Periods”) which will include the days elapsed between 
each Payment Date (including the initial Payment Date and excluding the final Payment Date). 
The first Interest Accrual Period will start on (and include) the Disbursement Date and will end on 
(and exclude) the first Payment Date, 22 March 2006. 
The Nominal Rate of Interest accrued by each Series of A1, B, C and D Bonds during each Interest 
Accrual Period will be the result of adding (i) the Reference Interest Rate, calculated as stipulated 
below, and common to all Bond Series, and rounded to the nearest thousandth, taking into account 
that, in the event of equal conditions for rounding up or down, the amount will always be rounded 
up, plus (ii) the spread applicable to each Series of A1, B, C and D Bonds, as indicated below. 
Part of the interest of Series A2 Bonds will be segregated on the Date of Incorporation in NAS-IO 
Securities, as described in this section.

41 
On each Payment Date, and until the maturity of the NAS-IO Securities, the notional amount of 
each NAS-IO Security will be equal to the Outstanding Nominal Balance of each A2 Bond on that 
Payment Date. The maturity date of NAS-IO Securities will be 22 June, 2009, or the maturity date 
of Series A2 Bonds, whichever is earlier. The maturity of NAS-IO Securities will not entitle their 
holders to any payment other than the payment derived from the following paragraphs.  
Each NAS-IO Security solely entitles its holder to payment of an amount equal to 1.6% of its 
notional amount, which will be equal to the Outstanding Nominal Balance of Series A2 Bonds 
(“NAS-IO Payment”) on each Payment Date and until its maturity. The NAS-IO Payment will be 
governed by the same Payment Priority Order rules that govern the Series A2 Bonds.  
On each Payment Date, the NAS-IO payment will be calculated with the following formula: 
 
 
where: 
Pi 
is the NAS-IO payment 
Ni  
is the notional amount of the NAS-IO securities (Outstanding Nominal Balance of 
the Series A2 Bonds), at the start of the pertinent Interest Accrual Period  
ri 
is 1.6%. 
On the first Payment Date, the NAS-IO payment will be calculated with the following formula: 
 
 
where: 
Pi 
is the NAS-IO payment 
Ni  
is the notional amount of the NAS-IO securities (Outstanding Nominal Balance of 
the Series A2 Bonds), at the start of the pertinent Interest Accrual Period  
ri 
is 1.6%; 
n 
is the number of days of the first of Interest Accrual Period (between the 
Disbursement Date and the first Payment Date); 
The NAS-IO Payment does not imply any itemization of principal and interest. The financial flows 
of the NAS-IO Payment are directly related to its notional amount, the redemption of Series A2 
Bonds and the maturity date of NAS-IO Securities.  
The holders of the NAS-IO Securities are not entitled to reimbursement of the subscription price, 
but only the right to collect, until it matures, the NAS-IO Payment, always subject to the Payment 
Priority Order. If an NAS-IO Payment is not made to the holders, the due and uncollected amounts 
will not accrue default interest. 
During each Interest Accrual Period, the Series A2 Bonds will accrue a Nominal Interest Rate 
equal to the sum of two amounts: 
(i) 
the result of applying to the Outstanding Nominal Balance of Series A2 Bonds at the start 
of the Interest Accrual Period an interest rate equal to the sum of the Reference Interest 
Rate plus a spread as determined under section 4.8; plus 
(ii) the NAS-IO payment, as defined above.

any legal effect or be relied upon with regard to the Note Issue. 
 
42 
If the NAS-IO Securities mature before the Series A2 Bonds, from that moment the Series A2 
Bonds will accrue a Nominal Interest Rate equal to the result of applying only the rule set out in 
section (i) supra, that is to say, the Reference Rate, plus the spread applicable in virtue of the 
provisions established above. 
Reference Rate of interest 
The Reference Interest Rate for setting the interest rate applicable to the Bonds of all Series will be 
the three (3) month EURIBOR interest rate or, if necessary, its substitute (the “Reference Interest 
Rate”), determined as stated below.  
Fixing of the Bond Reference Interest Rate 
The EURIBOR will be fixed according to the rules established in this section. 
On each Fixing Date, the Sociedad Gestora will fix the Reference Interest Rate, which will be 
equal to the EURIBOR, as follows:  
(i) 
The 3-month EURIBOR interest rate on the page EURIBOR= of the REUTERS screen, 
on the Fixing Date at 11:00 a.m. (CET time). “REUTERS screen, "EURIBOR page" is 
the one that displays the contents of the "EURIBOR page" on the REUTERS MONITOR 
MONEY RATES SERVICE (or any other page that may replace it in this service). 
(ii) In the absence of rates as indicated in section (i) supra, the three (3) month EURIBOR on 
the “TELERATE” screen (TELERATE SPAIN, S.A.), on page 248, or any other page 
that may be used instead on the Fixing Date at 11:00 a.m. (CET time) will prevail. 
(iii) In the absence of rates as indicated in sections (i) and (ii) supra, the simple arithmetic 
mean of London interbank rates for non transferable deposits in euros, with three (3) 
month maturity, for an amount equivalent to the Outstanding Nominal Balance of the 
Bonds offered on the Fixing Date by the entities mentioned below, after and at about 
11:00 a.m. (CET time) will prevail. This interest rate will be requested simultaneously 
from the following entities: 
- 
Banco Santander Central Hispano (London) 
- 
JP Morgan Chase & Co. (London) 
- 
Barclays Bank (London) 
- 
Confederación Española de Cajas de Ahorros (London Branch) 
In the event that one or several of the aforementioned institutions do not furnish a list of 
quoted rates, the rate applied will be the rate that results from applying the simple 
arithmetic mean of the rates declared by at least two of the remaining institutions.  
(iv) In the absence of rates as indicated in sections (i), (ii), and (iii), the rate applied will be 
the Reference Interest Rate of the immediately previous Interest Accrual Period, and so 
on for the following Interest Accrual Periods insofar as the situation remains unchanged. 
If the Reference Interest Rate is not published as specified in sections (i), (ii) and (iii) 
supra on the first Fixing Date, the rate applied will be the rate published, in accordance 
with the provisions of section (i), on the last Business Day on which such Reference 
Interest Rate has been published. 
The Sociedad Gestora will keep the listings of the contents of the REUTERS or TELERATE 
screens or, where applicable, the rates quoted by the institutions mentioned in section (iii) supra, 
as evidence of the EURIBOR rate applied.

Informativo" drafted in the Spanish language is the only official document, and no document other than the "Folleto Informativo"shall have 
any legal effect or be relied upon with regard to the Note Issue. 
 
43 
Notwithstanding the above, the Reference Rate of Interest for the first Interest Accrual Period, in 
other words, the period between the Disbursement Date and the first Payment Date, will be the 
result of the linear interpolation between the three (3) month EURIBOR rate and the four (4) 
month EURIBOR rate, taking into account the number of days of the first Interest Accrual Period. 
The Interest Rate for the first Interest Accrual Period will be calculated with the following 
formula: 
R= E3 + (21/31) * (E4-E3) 
Where: 
R= Reference Interest Rate for the first Interest Accrual Period. 
E3= three (3) month EURIBOR rate. 
E4= four (4) month EURIBOR rate. 
The three (3) month EURIBOR rate for the first Accrual Period will be determined in accordance 
with the rules established in the previous paragraphs of this section and the four (4) month 
EURIBOR rate will be determined in accordance with the same rules, although the time references 
made beforehand will change, accordingly, from three (3) to four (4) months, with the exception of 
the rule stipulated in section (iv) supra, which will not apply. 
Reference Interest Rate Fixing Date  
The Reference Interest Rate Fixing Date for each Interest Accrual Period will be the second (2nd) 
Business Day prior to the Payment Date in question ("Fixing Date") and will apply for the next 
Interest Accrual Period. For the first Interest Accrual Period, the Reference Interest Rate will be 
determined on 29 November 2005, before the start of the Subscription Period. 
Once the Reference Interest Rate has been fixed, and on the same Fixing Date, the Sociedad 
Gestora will calculate and fix, for each of the Series of Bonds, the Nominal Interest Rate 
applicable to the next Interest Accrual Period. 
Spread applicable to the Reference Interest Rate for each Series of Bonds 
The spread applicable to the Series A1, A2, B, C and D Bonds, expressed as a percentage, will be 
determined by common consent by the Lead Managers, at the latest, before 13:00 hours (CET 
time) on the second (2nd) Business Day before the Disbursement Date (that is to say, 29 November 
2005). The definitive spread applicable to the Bonds will be reported by fax to the Sociedad 
Gestora before 13:00 hours (CET time) on 29 November 2005 by the Lead Managers. The spreads 
that will be applied to each of the Series A1, A2, B, C and D to calculate the rate of interest that 
will accrue in each Interest Accrual Period will range as follows: 
 
 
 
Spread 
Series A1
0.11%-0.14% 
Series A2
0.17%-0.19% 
Series B 
0.30%-0.40% 
Series C 
0.55%-0.65% 
Series D 
1.50%-2.00% 
 
In the absence of such notice, the Sociedad Gestora will set the spread of such Series as 0.14%, for 
the Series A1 Bonds, 0.19% for the Series A2 Bonds, 0.40% for the Series B Bonds, 0.65% for the

C Series Bonds and 2.00% for the Series D Bonds. At the same time the Sociedad Gestora will 
also notify the CNMV of this additional information to the Prospectus. The final spread applicable 
will be registered in the disbursement certificate. 
Formula for calculating the interest of the Class A Bonds after the segregation of the NAS-
IO Securities, B, C and D 
The Sociedad Gestora will calculate the interest accrued by the Class A Bonds after the 
segregation of the NAS-IO Securities, B, C and D, during each Interest Accrual Period, in 
accordance with the following formula: 
 
 
 
 where: 
Ii 
Total amount of interest accrued by the Bond in the Interest Accrual Period. 
Ni  Outstanding Nominal Balance of the Bond at the start of the Interest Accrual Period. 
ri 
is the rate of interest of the Bond on an annual basis, calculated as the sum of the 
Reference Rate of Interest of the pertinent Interest Accrual Period plus the specified 
spread.  
ni 
 is the number of days in the Interest Accrual Period. 
4.8.1. 
Time limit on the validity of claims to interest and repayment of principal 
The interest of the Bonds, whatever their Class and Series, and the NAS-IO Payments 
will be payable at the end of each quarter, on 22 March, 22 June, 22 September and 22 
December of each year until the full maturity of the Securities. If any of these days is not 
a Business Day, the interest and principal for that quarter (except for the first Payment 
Date, which will be the interest and principal for the time elapsed between the 
Disbursement Date and the first Payment Date) will be paid the next Business Day (each 
of these dates, a “Payment Date”). The first Payment Date will be 22 March 2006. 
For the purposes of this Securities Issue, business days (“Business Days”) are all those 
days that are not non-business days on the TARGET (Trans European Automated Real-
Time Gross Settlement Express Transfer System) calendar. 
In the event that on a Payment Date, and despite the mechanisms established for the 
protection of the rights of the Security holders, the Available Funds were insufficient to 
satisfy the Fund interest payment obligations as specified in section 3.4.6. of the 
Additional Building Block, the amount available for the interest payment will be 
distributed in accordance with the Payment Priority Order stipulated in the 
aforementioned section and in the event that the Available Funds are only enough to 
partially pay obligations that rank in the same priority order, the amount available will be 
distributed among the Securities involved in proportion to their Outstanding Nominal 
Balance, and any amounts that the Security holders have not received will be paid on the 
next Payment Date when it is possible, without accruing additional interest. In this 
respect, the NAS-IO payment will be construed as Series A2 Bond interest and the 
amount that is allocated will be distributed between the Series A2 Bonds and the NAS-IO 
Securities (in the case of the NAS-IO Payment) in proportion to the amounts owed on 
such grounds. The payments outstanding to the Security holders will be made on the next

4.8.2. 
Description of the underlying security on which the interest rate and historic 
information is based upon 
The Reference Rate of Interest for determining the Nominal Interest Rate applicable to 
each of the Series of Bonds is as described in section 4.8. of this Securities Note. 
At present, the Euribor rate is the Euro interbank offered rate calculated as the daily 
average of the rates provided for fifteen maturity terms by a panel of 57 of the most active 
Euro zone banks. The rate is quoted on the basis of true days to maturity and 360 day-
years, and is fixed at 11:00 hours (CET) expressed with three (3) decimal points. 
Any Euribor-related definitions that might be approved by the Fédération Bancaire de 
l’Union Européenne (FBE) and by the Association Cambiste Internationale (ACI - 
Financial Markets Association) and that complement the existing definition of the 
Euribor, will be deemed to be included in the effects of the Reference Interest Rate 
relating to the Euribor without any need for these terms of the Reference Interest Rate to 
be modified or for the Security holders to be notified by the Sociedad Gestora. 
Solely for information purposes, there follow the data of the three (3) month Euribor rates 
published on the dates indicated, on the Reuters screen "EURIBOR=" page, as well as the 
interest rates that would have been applicable to the Bonds in accordance with these 
EURIBOR= rates, (entailing a spread of 0.125% for the Series A1 Bonds, of 0.18%% for 
the Series A2 Bonds, of 0.35% for the Series B Bonds, of 0.60% for the Series C Bonds 
and of 1.75% for the Series D Bonds):

4.8.3. 
Calculation Agent 
The Sociedad Gestora will be the agent responsible for calculating the interest on the 
Securities. 
4.9. 
Maturity date and redemption of the securities 
4.9.1. 
Redemption price 
The Bonds will be redeemed at 100% of their face value, that is to say, 100,000 euros per 
Bond, free of costs and taxes for the Bondholder, payable progressively on each principal 
Payment Date, as set forth in section 4.9.2. infra of this Securities Note. The holders of 
the NAS-IO Securities are not entitled to reimbursement of the subscription price, as is 
indicated in section 4.8. of this Securities Note. 
4.9.2. 
Date and types of redemption 
4.9.2.1 
Redemption of the Bonds  
Amount to be Redeemed  
The redemption of the Bonds will be conducted on a pro rata basis among the Bonds of 
the same Series that are scheduled for redemption on each Payment Date (as provided for 
below), by reducing the nominal amount, until it has been completed, by an amount equal 
to the smaller of the following amounts:  
(a) The positive difference on that Payment Date between the Outstanding Nominal 
Balance of the Bonds (before the amount redeemed on that Payment Date) and 
the Outstanding Nominal Balance of the non-defaulted Participations and the 
Certificates for the last day of the month prior to the month of the Payment Date, 
and 
(b)  the Available Funds on that Payment Date, after deducting the amounts of the 
preceding items in the Payment Priority Order. 
Consequently, in the event of defaulted Participations and Certificates (those whose 
Mortgage Loans are 12 months or more in arrears), the Bonds will be redeemed by an 
amount equal to their Nominal Balance Outstanding on the last day of the calendar month 
prior to the current Payment Date, plus the amounts due and uncollected from the 
aforementioned Payment Date until the last day of the calendar month prior to the current 
Payment Date. The Bonds will be redeemed using the Available Funds, always after 
paying any obligations that rank before the redemption in the Payment Priority Order. 
Should there not be any Available Funds for making these payments, the corresponding 
amounts will remain pending redemption until the immediately next Payment Date. 
Should it not be possible to substitute the Participations and Certificates, as stipulated in 
section 2.2.9. of the Additional Building Block, the proceeds of the early redemption, by 
the Sellers, of the Participations and/or Certificates in question, will form part of the 
Available Funds that will be applied on the next Payment Date. 
Sequential redemption 
The Bonds will be redeemed sequentially, such that the redemption of the Series A1 
Bonds will commence on the first Payment Date (22 March 2006) and the redemption of

the Series A2 Bonds will only commence when the Series A1 Bonds have been redeemed 
in full. 
The redemption of the Series B Bonds will only commence when the Class A Bonds have 
been redeemed in full.  
The redemption of the Series C Bonds will only commence when the Class B Bonds have 
been redeemed in full. 
And the redemption of the Series D Bonds will only commence when the Class C Bonds 
have been redeemed in full. 
Pro rata redemption requirements 
Notwithstanding the above, the amount to be redeemed will be distributed pro rata among 
the Class A, B, C and D Bonds in proportion to the Outstanding Nominal Balance of each 
of the Bonds, when the following circumstances occur simultaneously on a Payment 
Date: 
(1) that the ratio between the Outstanding Nominal Balance of the Series B, C and 
D Bonds, together, and the Outstanding Nominal Balance of all the Bonds, is 
twice the ratio between the Outstanding Nominal Balance of the Series B, C 
and D Bonds, together, and the Outstanding Nominal Balance of all the Bonds 
on the Date of Incorporation, 
(2) that the Outstanding Nominal Balance of the Non-Defaulted Participations and 
Certificates more than 90 days in arrears represents less than 1.5% of the 
Outstanding Nominal Balance of the total of the Non-Defaulted Participations 
and Certificates pooled in the Fund at that time, 
(3) that the Reserve Fund meets the required level , and 
(4) that, in the event that the Outstanding Nominal Balance of the Participations 
and the Certificates represents less than 10% of their Outstanding Nominal 
Balance on the Incorporation Date, the Sociedad Gestora does not decide to 
proceed with the early liquidation of the Fund. 
Payment of the Class A Bonds with allocation on a pro rata basis 
In this event, following the pro rata allocation among all the Bonds, the amount 
applicable, on that Payment Date, to the redemption of the Series A1 and A2 Bonds, will 
only be used to redeem the Series A1 Bonds, until they are fully redeemed. When the 
Series A1 Bonds have been redeemed, the amount applicable will be used to redeem the 
Series A2 Bonds, until they are fully redeemed.  
Exceptional rules regarding redemption of the Class A Bonds 
Exceptionally, if on a Payment Date, the Outstanding Nominal Balance of the Non-
Defaulted Participations and Certificates more than 90 days in arrears represents 3% or 
more of the Outstanding Nominal Balance of the total of the Non-Defaulted Participations 
and Certificates pooled in the Fund, the amount to be allocated to redemption of the Class 
A Bonds will be allocated on a pro rata basis to the Series A1 and A2 Bonds.  
The pro rata redemption of the Series A1 and A2 Bonds will continue provided that, on 
each Payment Date, the aforementioned arrears percentage remains at or exceeds 3%, 
otherwise the Series A1 and A2 Bonds will be redeemed sequentially again, as described 
above.

4.9.2.2 
Collection Dates, Calculation Dates, Calculation Periods and Notification 
Dates 
“Collection Date”, will be each of the dates on which the Sellers, as servicers of their 
respective mortgage loans, will pay the amounts received from such Mortgage Loans into 
the Collection Account. CAJA CASTILLA LA MANCHA and CREDIFIMO will make 
their payments on a weekly basis, each Tuesday or, if is not a Business Day, on the 
immediately next Business Day. BANKPIME will make its payments on the 4th and 19th 
of each month or, if either of these is not a Business Day, the immediately next Business 
Day. 
The deposits in the Collection Account may be made at different intervals, pursuant to the 
provisions of section 3.4.4.1. of the Additional Building Block. 
“Calculation Date” will mean the date on which the Sociedad Gestora will calculate the 
amount that each Seller should have delivered to it during the previous Calculation Period 
and the Technical Advance, as well as the date on which it will transfer the Collected 
Amount from the Collection Account to the Treasury Account, that is to say, the 20th of 
each month or, if it is not a Business Day, the immediately previous Business Day. The 
first Calculation Date will be 20 December 2005. 
“Calculation Period”, will mean a period that coincides with a calendar month. 
Exceptionally, the first Calculation Period will commence on the Date of Incorporation of 
the Fund and will end on the last day of the month of November 2005 (both inclusive). 
“Notification Dates”, will mean the second Business Day before each Payment Date 
throughout the life of the Fund. On these dates, the Sociedad Gestora will notify the 
amounts of principal and interest payable to the Bondholders, in the manner described in 
section 4.1.3.1. of the Additional Building Block. 
4.9.3. 
Early Redemption of the Bond Issue 
Notwithstanding the obligation of the Fund, through its Sociedad Gestora, to redeem the 
Bonds of each Series on the Legal Maturity Date (22 June 2040 or, if this is not a 
Business Day, the next Business Day) or the partial redemptions on each Payment Date, 
as established in the previous sections, the Sociedad Gestora will be authorised to proceed 
to carry out the Early Liquidation of the Fund and hence the early redemption (“Early 
Redemption”), on a Payment Date, of the entire Bond Issue, in accordance with the 
events of early liquidation and the requirements set forth in section 4.4. of the 
Registration Document and subject to the Payment Priority Order set forth in section 
3.4.6. of the Additional Building Block. 
4.10. Indication of the yield 
The main characteristic of the Bonds of this Issue is that their periodic redemption depends on the 
aggregate behaviour of the Mortgage Loans.  
The average life, yield, duration and final maturity of the Bonds of each Series and, where 
applicable, the NAS-IO Securities, depend on diverse factors, the most significant of which are as 
follows:  
a) 
 The repayment system and calendar for each of the Mortgage Loans stipulated in the 
related contracts. 


This prospectus is a translation into English of the original "Folleto Informativo" drafted in Spanish language and registered with the 
"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores" (the Spanish Securities Market Commission, "CNMV") on November 25h, 2005. The "Folleto 
Informativo" drafted in the Spanish language is the only official document, and no document other than the "Folleto Informativo"shall have 
any legal effect or be relied upon with regard to the Note Issue. 
 
50 
b) 
The capacity of the Mortgagors to prepay, in full or in part, the Mortgage Loans and the 
pace at which such early redemption takes place in aggregate over the life of the Fund. 
c) 
The floating interest rates that will apply to each of the Mortgage Loans, which will cause 
the amount of each repayment instalment to vary. 
d) 
Arrears of the Mortgagors in making the Mortgage Loan repayments. 
In this regard, early redemptions by the Debtors of the Mortgage Loans are very significant. The 
early redemptions are subject to continuous change and in this Prospectus are estimated using 
several assumptions for the future behaviour of the constant annual early redemption rate 
(“ERR”). This will have a direct bearing on the pace at which the Bonds are redeemed and hence 
on their average life and duration.  
To calculate the data shown in the tables contained in this section, the following assumptions have 
been made regarding the aforesaid factors: 
1. the annual Nominal Interest Rates applicable to the Bonds of each Series, variable 
quarterly, taking into account the Euribor 3 months of 17 November 2005, that is to say, 
2.350%, will be maintained constant throughout the term of the loans at the following 
rates:  
 
 
 
Taking into account that, on the first Payment Date, the Reference Interest Rate will be the 
rate that results from the linear interpolation between the three (3) month EURIBOR rate and 
the four (4) month EURIBOR rate, pursuant to the provisions of section 4.8. of this Securities 
Note, and since the four (4) month EURIBOR rate on 17 November 2005 is 2.395% and, 
therefore the interpolated Euribor is 2.380%, the Nominal Rate of Interest applicable to the 
Bonds of each Series on the first Payment Date would be as follows: 
 
 
 
2
2.    weighted average interest rate for the pooled Participations and Certificates: 3.57%; 
3. arrears of more than thirty (30) days of the Participations and Certificates portfolio 0% 
per annum; 
4. Participation and Certificate portfolio NPLs: 0.3% per annum from December 2006, with 
75% of the stock of NPLs recovered one year later; 
5. that the Disbursement Date will be 1 December 2005; 
6. Assuming that the Sociedad Gestora will exercise the option relating to the Early 
Liquidation and Early Redemption of the Bond issue, when the Outstanding Nominal 
Balance of the Mortgage Loans is less than 10% of their Outstanding Nominal Balance on 
the Date of Incorporation, the average life, IRR, duration and final maturity of the 
Securities at different ERR, would be as follows:

The Sociedad Gestora declares that the information in the charts displayed below is only given by 
way of example, and the amounts do not represent a specific obligation by the Fund to make 
payments to third parties on the respective dates or in the periods to which they refer. The figures 
have been drawn up on the hypothesis that the loan default and repayment rates remain constant 
throughout the life of the Fund yet are actually subject to constant change.  Therefore any investor 
interested in knowing the payments that the Fund  is scheduled to make on each specific date must 
request the pertinent information from the institutions authorised to distribute it, Sociedad Gestora, 
AIAF Market and CNMV. Nevertheless, the information can also be requested through the 
Underwriting Agents and other entities that operate on the secondary market. The hypotheses that 
have been used to produce the charts below are the same as those included at the start of this 
section; in particular, a hypothesis of arrears of more than thirty (30) days of the Participations and 
Certificates portfolio 0% per annum and a Participations and Certificates portfolio NPL ratio equal 
to 0.3% per annum from December 2006, with 75% of the stock of NPLs recovered one year later.

4.13. Issue date of the securities  
The Securities issue date will coincide with the date that the Articles of Incorporation is granted. 
The securities have been issued in order to be acquired by cualified investors. The Securities will 
be subscribed during the Subscription Period, which will start on the Business Day prior to the 
Disbursement Date (that is to say, 30 November 2005), at 10:00 hours (CET hour) and will end on 
the Disbursement Date (that is to say, 1 December 2005), at 10:00 hours (CET hour). 
The Underwriting and Placement Agents mentioned in section 5.2 of the Registration Document, 
in accordance with the nature of the issue and the customary practices in these markets, may 
distribute the underwritten Securities at their discretion, according to the provisions of the 
Placement Subscription and Underwriting Contract between the Sociedad Gestora and the 
Underwriting and Placement Agents, in all events endeavouring to ensure that no discriminatory 
treatment is given to orders of similar characteristics, notwithstanding which BSIL may give 
priority to the orders from its clients as it deems fit, albeit always taking into consideration the 
instructions received from the other Underwriting and Placement Agents. 
The Bonds will be disbursed on 1 December 2005 (“ Disbursement Date”) at the price of 100% 
of the nominal unit value, except for series A2, which will be an amount between 104.1% and 
106%, as stipulated in section 4.2. supra of this Securities Note. 
Investors to whom the Securities have been allotted must pay the Underwriting and Placement 
Agents, before 10:00 hours (CET time), of the Disbursement Date, for value that same day, the 
issue price of each Security allotted thereto.  
The subscription commitments entered into by each Underwriting and Placement Agent will be 
disbursed before 11:00 hours (CET time), of the Disbursement Date, by means of each 
Underwriting and Placement Agent paying the amount it owes in this respect into the account 
opened by the Paying Agent in the name of the Fund, for value that same day. 
4.14. Restrictions on the free transferability of the securities. 
The Securities are freely transferable and can be transmitted through any legally permissible 
means. Registration of the transfer to the purchaser in the accounting register will have the same 
effects as the trading of shares, and from that moment onwards the transfer can be relied upon as 
against third parties.

5. ADMISSION TO TRADING AND DEALING ARRANGEMENTS 
5.1. 
Market where the securities will be traded 
The Sociedad Gestora, for and on behalf of the Fund, will apply to have the Issue admitted to 
official trading, once the Disbursement has taken place, on the AIAF Fixed Income Market so that 
the Bonds can be traded no later than one (1) month after the Disbursement Date. 
If the Sociedad Gestora fails to have the Securities admitted to trading in the aforementioned time 
frame, it will notify the CNMV accordingly and publish, in a nationwide newspaper, both the 
reasons for such failure and the new date on which the issued Securities are scheduled to be 
admitted to trading, without prejudice to the possibility for the Sociedad Gestora to be held 
contractually liable if the failure is attributable to it. 
The Sociedad Gestora, for and on behalf of the Fund, will request the inclusion of the Securities in 
the accounting register managed by IBERCLEAR, so that their clearing and settlement is effected 
in accordance with the operating rules applicable to securities quoted in the AIAF Fixed Income 
Market established, or to be approved in the future by IBERCLEAR. 
The Sociedad Gestora, for and on behalf of the Fund, hereby declares that it knows the 
requirements and conditions necessary for listing, quotation and delisting of securities in the AIAF 
Fixed Income Market according to the applicable laws and the requirements of its ruling body and 
agrees to comply with the same. 
The Sociedad Gestora, for and on behalf of the Fund, will also request the inclusion of this Issue in 
the accounting register managed by EUROCLEAR and CLEARSTREAM. 
5.2. 
Paying Agent and depository agents 
The payment of interest and principal for the Securities Issue referred to in this Securities Note 
will be handled by SCH, located for these purposes in purposes in Santander (Spain), at Paseo de 
Pereda, 9 - 12, which has the resources to carry out this function. 
The interest of the Securities will be paid on each of the Payment dates, in accordance with the 
terms and conditions set forth in section 4.8 of this Securities Note. 
The Sociedad Gestora, on behalf of and for the account of the Fund, will enter into a Financial 
Services Contract with SCH for the financial servicing of the Securities issued by the Fund 
(hereinafter, “Financial Services Contract”).  
The obligations to be assumed by SCH as paying agent in this Financial Services Contract are as 
summarised below:  
(i) 
On the Disbursement Date, pay to each of the Underwriting and Placement Agents 
the amount of the underwriting and distribution fee owing to each of them. 
(ii) 
On each Payment Date, make the payments to the Security holders and, where 
applicable, to the other entities to which such payments must be made, after 
receiving appropriate instructions from the Sociedad Gestora. 
(iii) 
On each Fixing Date, notify the Sociedad Gestora of the Reference Interest Rate that 
will serve as the basis for calculating the Nominal Interest Rate applicable to each 
Series of the Bonds for each pertinent Interest Accrual Period. 
Furthermore, SCH will act as the custodian of the Multiple Certificates and of the Treasury 
Account, the Collection Account and the Liquidity Line Sinking Account.

any legal effect or be relied upon with regard to the Note Issue. 
 
62 
As consideration for the services to be performed by the Paying Agent, the Fund will pay the 
latter, on each Payment Date, a quarterly fee of three thousand (3,000.00) euros, plus one quarter 
of the that results from applying 0.0035% to the Outstanding Nominal Balance of the 
Participations and the Certificates on each Payment Date prior to the payment date on which it 
must be paid, as consideration for its services under the Financial Services Contract. On the first 
Payment Date, the fee payable to the Paying Agent will be calculated on the basis of the number of 
days elapsed since the Disbursement Date.  
Without prejudice to the provisions of the previous paragraph, the non-confirmation before the 
start of the Subscription Period of the provisional ratings assigned to the Securities by the Rating 
Agencies as well as the occurrence of any other event that could lead to the termination of the 
incorporation of the Fund, will both be construed as grounds for termination of the Financial 
Services Contract and the rest of the Fund Contracts. 
The Financial Services Contract will terminate on the date that the Fund is liquidated. 
Notwithstanding the above, the Sociedad Gestora is authorised to substitute the Paying Agent (in 
all or some of its duties as the administrator of the Treasury Account, the Collection Account, the 
Liquidity Line Sinking Account, paying agency or depository of the Participations and the 
Certificates), provided that this is permitted under current law and, if and when necessary, the 
authorisation of the competent authorities is obtained. The grounds that give rise to the substitution 
must be serious and be liable to harm the interests of the Security holders in the opinion of the 
Rating Agencies. The substitution will be reported to the CNMV, the Rating Agencies and the 
Sellers. 
Additionally, in the event that the credit ratings assigned by the Rating Agencies to the short-term 
risk of the Paying Agent, which is currently rated as A-1 by S&P and as F1+ by Fitch, are 
downgraded below A-1, in the case of S&P, or below F1, in the case of Fitch, or if such rating is 
withdrawn by either of the Rating Agencies for any reason, within the thirty (30) days following 
such downgrading the Sociedad Gestora, in order to maintain the ratings assigned to each of the 
Series and to the NAS-IO Securities by the Rating Agencies, and after notifying the latter, will put 
into practice, on account of the Fund, one of the options that are described below and are 
necessary, to permit an appropriate level of collateralisation to be maintained with respect to the 
commitments derived from the duties as depository of the Participations and Certificates, paying 
agent, and maintenance of the Treasury Account, the Collection Account and the Liquidity Line 
Sinking Account: 
(a) 
Secure similar guarantees or commitments from one or several credit institutions 
with an S&P rating of no less than A-1, and with a Fitch rating of no less than F1, 
that guarantees the commitments accepted by the Paying Agent;  
(b) 
Substitute the Paying Agent with an entity that has an S&P rating of no less than A-
1, and a Fitch rating of no less than F1. This new entity will perform the Paying 
Agent's duties in the same terms and conditions. 
Furthermore, the Paying Agent will be entitled to terminate the Financial Services Contract by 
giving the Sociedad Gestora at least two (2) months' notice, in accordance with the terms set forth 
in the Financial Services Contract, and provided that (i) another entity of similar financial 
characteristics to the Paying Agent and with a short-term credit rating of at least F1, in the case of 
Fitch, and of A-1, in the case of S&P, accepted by the Sociedad Gestora, takes over the duties 
accepted by the latter under the Financial Services Contract, (ii) the CNMV and the Rating 
Agencies are notified and (iii) the rating assigned to the Securities by the Rating Agencies is not 
affected. All the expenses derived from this substitution will be for the account of the previous or 
new Paying Agent. However, the termination will not take place, unless authorized by the

Sociedad Gestora, until two (2) Business Days after the Payment Date following the issue of the 
notice of termination.  
Notwithstanding the above, the Paying Agent will be entitled to unilaterally discharge the contract 
if the Sociedad Gestora, acting on behalf of the Fund, is in breach of its payment obligations, in 
which case the Paying Agent will initiate the procedure for its substitution in accordance with the 
provisions of this paragraph, and the Sociedad Gestora will be obliged to cooperate as required for 
such purposes. 
Subject to the provisions of the previous paragraphs, all or part of the Financial Services Contract 
may be terminated early, in the sense of affecting all or only some of the duties entrusted to the 
Paying Agent under the aforementioned contract and, in either case, it will give rise to the 
payment, on the next Payment Date in question, of the part of the remuneration described in the 
this Section in proportion to the time that has passed until all or part of the aforementioned duties 
are terminated. In the event that the termination is partial, on the termination date the Sociedad 
Gestora and the Paying Agent will agree on the amount of compensation to be imputed to the duty 
that the Paying Agent ceases to perform.

7.4. 
Information sourced from third parties 
As part of the tasks involved in checking the information contained in this Prospectus, the 
Sociedad Gestora has received confirmation from each of the Sellers that the information about the 
Sellers, the Mortgage Loans, the Mortgage Participations and the Mortgage Transfer Certificates 
that is given in section 2.2.8 of the Additional Building Block is true, and that the rest of the 
information about the Sellers, the Mortgage Loans, the Mortgage Participations and the Mortgage 
Transfer Certificates that is contained in this Prospectus is also true. In the Articles of 
Incorporation of the Fund, the Sellers will repeat to the Sociedad Gestora that such information 
remains true on the Date of Incorporation. 
The Sociedad Gestora has accurately reproduced the information that it has received from the 
Sellers and, insofar as it knows and can tell from such information received from the Sellers, 
confirms that it has not omitted any fact that might result in the information reproduced being 
inaccurate or misleading, nor does this Prospectus omit material facts or data that could be 
significant for the investor. 
7.5. 
Credit ratings assigned by the Rating Agencies 
The Bonds included in this Securities Note have been assigned, prior to the registration of this 
Prospectus, the following ratings by the following credit risk agencies (hereinafter, Fitch and S&P 
will be referred to jointly as the “Rating Agencies”): 
 
Fitch

AAA

Series B

Series C 
BBB

Series D

The rating assigned by S&P as to the credit risk is an opinion about the capacity of the Securities 
to make the periodic conforming interest and principal payments throughout the life of the 
transaction and, in any event, in case of the principal, before the Fund's Legal Maturity Date. 


This prospectus is a translation into English of the original "Folleto Informativo" drafted in Spanish language and registered with the 
"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores" (the Spanish Securities Market Commission, "CNMV") on November 25h, 2005. The "Folleto 
Informativo" drafted in the Spanish language is the only official document, and no document other than the "Folleto Informativo"shall have 
any legal effect or be relied upon with regard to the Note Issue. 
 
65 
The S&P rating is based on the quality of the Participations and the Certificates pooled in the 
Fund, on the credit enhancement available and on the legal and financial aspects of the Securities 
Issue. 
The S&P rating does not constitute an assessment of the risk of the Mortgagors making advance 
payments or repaying all of the principal of the Participations and the Certificates. The S&P rating 
does not in any way assess the level of return received by investors. 
To perform its analysis, S&P has relied on the statements made by the entities participating in the 
transaction, by their auditors and lawyers, and by other experts, about the accuracy and 
completeness of the information that it has been given in relation to the rating and the subsequent 
monitoring. 
The rating assigned by S&P upon the creation of the Fund may be revised, suspended or 
withdrawn, depending on any information that comes to its notice, or on the non-availability of 
information, or for any other reason. The ratings assigned by Fitch measure the capacity of the 
Fund to timely pay interest on each scheduled Payment Date and repay the principal throughout 
the transaction and, in any event, before the Legal Maturity Date, in accordance with the terms and 
conditions stipulated for the Securities in the Prospectus and in the Articles of Incorporation, 
which allow the delay of payment of interest on the Series B, C and D Bonds under certain 
circumstances. This means that interest might not be received in respect of these Bonds during a 
certain period of time if the delay trigger is reached, with such circumstance not being considered 
an event of default on payment of the Bonds. The Fitch rating of the NAS-IO Security does not 
constitute an assessment of the risk of the Mortgagors making advance payments. 
The ratings assigned by Fitch are based on the documents and information supplied by the issuer, 
and its experts and agents, and are subject to the reception of the final documents. Fitch does not 
audit, verify or check the truth, precision or accuracy of such information. 
Ratings may be changed, qualified, suspended, placed on Rating Watch or withdrawn as a result of 
changes in, additions to, accuracy of, unavailability of or inadequacy of information or for any 
reason Fitch Ratings deems sufficient. 
The scale of ratings for long term debt employed by the Rating Agencies are as follows:

The ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold the Securities. Ratings do not comment 
on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of the Securities for a particular investor, or the 
tax-exempt nature or taxability of any payments of the Securities. 
As explained in section 10 of the Registration Document, the document in which each Rating 
Agency assigns this Issue its provisional rating will be available to interested parties at the 
registered offices of the Fund and of the CNMV. Moreover, the CNMV will receive a copy of the 
document in which each Rating Agency assigns this Issue its definitive rating. 
The Sociedad Gestora, on behalf of the Fund, undertakes to provide the Rating with periodic 
information regarding the situation of the Fund and the behaviour of the Mortgage Loans in order 
to allow them to continue rating the Securities. Similarly, it will supply the said information 
whenever reasonably requested to do so and, in any event, whenever a change occurs in the 
conditions of the Fund, in the contracts entered into by the Fund through its Sociedad Gestora or in 
the interested parties. 
Should any of the provisional ratings assigned to the Securities by the Rating Agencies not be 
confirmed as definitive before the start of the Subscription Period, the following will be construed 
as terminated: the issuance and subscription of the Participations and the Certificates, the Initial 
Expenses Loan, as well as the rest of the Fund contracts, the Incorporation of the Fund and the 
issue of the Securities. 
The Prospectus submitted for filing and registration at the CNMV is exactly the same as the 
Prospectus delivered to the Rating Agencies.

However, in order to consolidate its financial structure and procure the largest possible coverage 
for the risks inherent to the issue, the Sociedad Gestora, on behalf of the Fund, will proceed on the

This Audit Report has been based on a selection of mortgage loans taken from the 6,925 mortgage 
loans, with a balance as at 25 October 2005 of Euros 526,108,073.63, that form the audited 
portfolio, using sampling techniques, which are a generally accepted method for verifying an 
entity's records relating to a group of items (“population”), and make it possible to draw a 
conclusion about that population through the analysis of a smaller number of items (“sample”) 
than the total population. The confidence level indicates the probability that the actual number of 
items with deviations from a pattern existing in a population will not exceed a predefined limit 
(“accuracy”).  
If the audit detects errors in any of the mortgage loans in the Sellers' portfolios, those loans will 
not be transferred on the Date of Incorporation. 
2.2.1. 
Legal jurisdiction by which the pool of assets is governed. 
The Participations and the Certificates relating to the Mortgage Loans will be issued in 
accordance with the laws of Spain. 
2.2.2. 
General characteristics of the Mortgagors. 
All the Mortgagors are private individuals. The details of the most significant 
characteristics of the selected mortgage loans are described throughout section 2. of this 
Additional Building Block. 
The tables below show the distribution of the mortgage loans that make up the audited 
portfolio by the geographical location of the security, contracted date, current balance, 
current rate, reference rate and spread, residual maturity, date of the next rate review and 
months in arrears. These tables have been produced with information as at 25 October 
2005.

This prospectus is a translation into English of the original "Folleto Informativo" drafted in Spanish language and registered with the 
"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores" (the Spanish Securities Market Commission, "CNMV") on November 25h, 2005. The "Folleto 
Informativo" drafted in the Spanish language is the only official document, and no document other than the "Folleto Informativo"shall have 
any legal effect or be relied upon with regard to the Note Issue.

2.2.3. 
Legal nature of the assets 
As indicated previously, all the assets will be Mortgage Loans that will be transferred to 
the Fund by the Sellers through the issue of Participations and Certificates. With respect 
to the audited portfolio, 86.18% of the outstanding nominal balance consists of mortgage 
participations and 13.82% of the outstanding nominal balance consists of mortgage 
transfer certificates, distributed among the Sellers as displayed below:

The Mortgage Loans are divided into two categories, in line with their characteristics: 
-  
Mortgage Loans that meet the requirements of Section Two of the Ley del 
Mercado Hipotecario 2/1981, of 25 March (Mortgage Market Act - the “Ley 
del Mercado Hipotecario”) and that are transferred to the Fund through the 
issue of Participations (the “Mortgage Loans 1”). 
-  
Mortgage Loans that do not meet all the requirements of section two of the 
Ley del Mercado Hipotecario, including the requirements that mortgages 
must not exceed 80% of the appraised value of the mortgaged properties or 
that the mortgage loans must be secured by first-class real estate mortgages, 
which are transferred to the Fund through the issue of the Certificates, 
pursuant to article 18 of Ley 44/2002 (the “Mortgage Loans 2”). 
The Mortgage Loans are documented in public deeds and registered at the Land Registry, 
and can be foreclosed in accordance with the provisions of Title IV of Book III of the Ley 
de Enjuiciamiento 1/2000, of 7 January (Civil Procedural Act). 
2.2.4. 
Expiry or maturity date of the assets 
Each Mortgage Loan in the portfolio has a maturity date, without prejudice to the 
possibility of its early redemption, in accordance with the Special Terms and Conditions 
stipulated in each one.  


This prospectus is a translation into English of the original "Folleto Informativo" drafted in Spanish language and registered with the 
"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores" (the Spanish Securities Market Commission, "CNMV") on November 25h, 2005. The "Folleto 
Informativo" drafted in the Spanish language is the only official document, and no document other than the "Folleto Informativo"shall have 
any legal effect or be relied upon with regard to the Note Issue. 
 
81 
At any time of the life of the Mortgage Loans, the Mortgagors can redeem all or part of 
the outstanding capital early, and interest will cease to accrue on the early redeemed part 
from the date on which the repayment is made. 
Section 2.2.2 of this Additional Building Block contains a chart with the distribution of 
the Mortgage Loans according to their residual maturity. The last regular redemption date 
of the mortgage loans is 10 June 2037. 
2.2.5. 
Amount of the assets 
On the Date of Incorporation, the Participations and Certificates that will be transferred to 
the Fund, with an Outstanding Nominal Balance equal to or slightly less than FOUR 
HUNDRED AND EIGHTY-FIVE million (485,000,000) euros, will be withdrawn from 
the loans in the portfolio audited as at 25 October 2005, which consists of 6,925 mortgage 
loans with an outstanding nominal balance of 526,108,073.63 euros.

2.2.7. 
Asset creation method 
CAJA CASTILLA LA MANCHA 
At the customer's request, the branch conducts a preliminary analysis and valuation with a 
view to the approval of the mortgage loan transaction. 
Normally during the first interview with customers, the following information is obtained 
about the transaction: information about the property, terms, financing needs, mortgages 
offered by other banks, etc. Customers are also told which type of loan best suits their 
needs, and about the nature, terms and conditions of the transaction (term, form of 
payment, expenses, rate of interest, etc.) and the documents that they must furnish. 
When the customers decide to apply for the loan and furnish all the documents and 
information requested, the branch office starts to process and analyse the application.  


This prospectus is a translation into English of the original "Folleto Informativo" drafted in Spanish language and registered with the 
"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores" (the Spanish Securities Market Commission, "CNMV") on November 25h, 2005. The "Folleto 
Informativo" drafted in the Spanish language is the only official document, and no document other than the "Folleto Informativo"shall have 
any legal effect or be relied upon with regard to the Note Issue. 
 
82 
The branch processes the application in an automated fashion, requesting a property 
valuation, information from the CIRBE (Bank of Spain Central Risk Information 
Database) and the RAI Credit Bureau, and the other documentation necessary to assess 
the risk properly, according to internal regulations. 
When all the information has been obtained, a loan viability analysis is conducted that 
includes the use of a scoring programme. The main criterion underlying a decision to 
grant a loan is the customer's capacity to repay the loan on time, and any additional 
security or collateral is considered to support the transaction, but under no circumstances 
as a decision-making criterion. 
When all the information has been obtained, the branch office decides whether or not to 
grant the loan, if it is authorised to do so, or else submits the transaction for approval at a 
higher decision-making level authorised to do so. 
When the transaction has been authorised at the pertinent level, all the relevant documents 
are drawn up, the deed is signed in the presence of a Notary Public and all the legal 
formalities necessary for the transaction to be considered properly entered into are 
completed. 
Once a customer has furnished all the required documents, the transaction can be carried 
out within eight to ten days. 
In the case of subrogated loans, it is the property developer who gives CAJA CASTILLA 
LA MANCHA a list of the home buyers, as well as a copy of the private contracts of sale. 
The branch office handles the formalities with the customers, securing their prior 
commitment to be subrogated to the mortgage and requests the documents it needs to 
analyse the transaction. 
 
CREDIFIMO 
1.1.  Description of the process: 
Credifimo mainly engages in lending to private individuals, chiefly for home buying 
purposes and, to a lesser extent, consumer loans. 
Therefore most of its sales efforts are oriented to attracting customers interested in 
financing sales conducted through real estate agencies. Credifimo appoints area 
representatives who visit and advise a group of these agencies. Consequently the 
procedure for granting personal or mortgage loans is as follows: 
The real estate agent sends the area representative the application, together with proof of 
the applicant's level of income and the documents necessary for each type of transaction. 
If the area representative considers the application viable, after calculating the applicant's 
creditworthiness and job stability, refers the application to his/her Sales Manager. 
The Sales Manager analyses the viability of the transaction, asking the area representative 
and real estate agency for further documents (bank guarantees, additional documentation, 
additional real property as collateral, etc.) when deemed necessary. When all the 
information has been provided and if the Sales Manager considers the application viable, 
it is referred to the Risks Department, formed by a Risks Manager and six analysts with 
different types of duties, and the Deputy Director General makes the final decision. If the 
Risks Committee considers the loan viable after examining the report and the 
documentation, it issues a signed and dated report. If it is not viable, the application is 
rejected, or further collateral is requested and it is not processed.

2.2.9. 
Substitution of the securitised assets 
In the exceptional event that, after the Date of Incorporation and, notwithstanding the 
declarations made by each Seller and the diligence exercised by the latter in ensuring their 
truthfulness, it is found, during life of the Fund, that one of the Participations and/or 
Certificates or that one of the Mortgage Loans upon which the latter have been issued, did 
not conform, on the Date of Incorporation of the Fund, to the declarations made in section 
2.2.8. of this Additional Building Block and set forth in Clause 8.3. of the Articles of 
Incorporation, the Sellers undertake as follows: 
(A) To substitute the Participation and/or Certificate in question with another of similar 
financial characteristics, in terms of the amount, residual term, interest rate, 
characteristics 
of 
the 
mortgagor 
and 
mortgaged 
property 
and 
current 
balance/appraised value ratio, that is accepted by the Sociedad Gestora, reported to 
the Rating Agencies and provided that it does not affect the Securities ratings 
granted by such Agencies. 
The amounts accrued and unpaid until the date of substitution of the Participation 
and/or Certificate that is to be substituted, must be paid to the Fund by the Seller in 
question, in its capacity as administrator, at the time that such Participation and/or 
Certificate is substituted. 
Be that as it may, when substituting a Participation and/or Certificate, the Sellers 
must attest that the substitute Participation and/or Certificate conforms to the 
declarations set forth in section 2.2.8. of this Additional Building Block. 
As soon as each Seller learns that one of the Participations and/or Certificates that it 
has issued or that one of the Mortgage Loans underlying them does not conform the 
aforementioned declarations, it will report the matter to the Sociedad Gestora and, 
within five (5) days, indicate the mortgage loans with respect to which it intends to

91 
issue new mortgage participations and/or mortgage transfer certificates to substitute 
the ones affected. If any Participation and/or Certificate is substituted, pursuant to 
the provisions of this paragraph, the Seller in question will proceed to issue a new 
Multiple Certificate that will be exchanged for the certificate that was issued on the 
Date of Incorporation. 
The Seller in question undertakes to formalize the substitution of Participations and 
Certificates in a public deed and in the manner and time frame stipulated by the 
Sociedad Gestora, and to furnish any related information that the Sociedad Gestora 
deems necessary. The substitution will be reported to the Rating Agencies and a 
copy of the deed will be sent to the CNMV. 
(B) In addition to the obligation assumed in point (A) supra and whenever the 
substitution stipulated therein is not possible because the mortgage loans available 
are not homogeneous with the securitised portfolio in terms of (i) the amount, (ii) 
the residual term, (iii) the interest rate, (iv) the characteristics of the mortgagor, (v) 
the characteristics of the mortgaged property, or (vi) current balance/appraised value 
ratio, the Seller in question undertakes to proceed to the early redemption of the 
Participation and/or Certificate in question, by reimbursing, in cash, both the 
outstanding capital of the Participation and/or Certificate in question and the interest 
accrued and unpaid to date, as well as payable any other amount owing to the Fund 
with respect to the Participation and/or Certificate in question, by depositing it in the 
Collection Account. The amounts received from the Participations and/or 
Certificates in question in the aforementioned circumstances will be added to the 
Available Funds and applied on the next Payment Date. 
In particular, should the Seller in question modify the terms and conditions of the 
Mortgage Loans during their lifetime without complying with the limits established in the 
special legislation applicable and with the terms agreed between the Fund and the Seller 
in the Articles of Incorporation of the Fund and in this Prospectus, in section 3.7.1. of this 
Additional Building Block, the Seller will be considered in breach of its obligations and 
the Fund will not be held responsible. In the event of such breach, the Fund, through the 
Sociedad Gestora, will be entitled to (i) seek pertinent damages and (ii) seek the 
substitution or reimbursement of the Participations and/or Certificates in question, 
pursuant to the provisions of letters (A) and (B) supra. This will not imply that the Seller 
guarantees the success of the transaction, but the necessary redress of the effects caused 
by the breach of its obligations, pursuant to article 1,124 of the Civil Code. The expenses 
originating from the actions to remedy the breach of the Seller will be borne by the latter 
and may not be recovered from the Fund. 
The Sociedad Gestora will notify the CNMV immediately whenever Loans are substituted 
or redeemed as a result of breach by the Sellers. 
2.2.10. Relevant insurance policies relating to the securitised assets 
Pursuant to the declarations and warranties set forth in section 2.2.8. of the Additional 
Building Block, all the properties mortgaged as security for the Mortgage Loans are 
insured against damages by insurance policies in favour of the Seller in question, in which 
the insured sum is not less than the valuation of the mortgaged property, excluding items 
which by their nature are uninsurable. For these purposes, Caja Castilla La Mancha and 
Bankpime has taken out a global subsidiary insurance policy that guarantees damage 
insurance coverage if none exists or if the insured sums are insufficient..

At the same time, each Seller will formalize the transfer, associated to the issue of the 
Participations and the Certificates, of its rights as the beneficiary of the material damage 
insurance policies taken out by the Mortgagors or any other insurance policy that affords 
equivalent coverage. Therefore the Fund, insofar as it is the owner of the Participations 
and the Certificates, will be entitled to any amounts that the Sellers should have received 
on these grounds. 
2.2.11. Information on the debtors where the securitised assets including obligations of 5 or

20% of the assets, or where a single debtor accounts for a material portion of the

by the Valuation Companies that the Sellers have with respect to their Mortgage Loans.

The full and unconditional assignment to the Fund of the credit rights which are derived 
from the Mortgage Loans, with the exceptions noted in section 3.3.3 of this Additional 
Building Block, by means of the issuance of the Participations and Certificates, will take 
place on the Date of Incorporation for the remaining term to maturity of said Loans, with 
no agreement of any kind to repurchase on the part of the Sellers. The Participations and 
the Certificates will begin to accrue the corresponding interest, beginning on the Date of 
Incorporation (inclusive), which is 28 November 2005, with the result that the interest 
accrued on the Mortgage Loans beginning on the Date of Incorporation will be for the 
benefit of the Fund, irrespective of the actual accrual period used to calculate the interest 
payment on said loans. 
The Sellers will not assume any responsibility whatsoever for non-payment by the 
Mortgagors, whether for principal, interest, or any other amount which the Mortgagors 
may owe pursuant to the Mortgage Loans. Likewise, they will not be held liable, in any 
form whatsoever, for directly or indirectly guaranteeing the successful conclusion of this 
transaction, nor will they grant collateral or bank guarantees, nor will they enter into 
agreements to repurchase the Participations and the Certificates, whether pursuant to the 
Articles of Incorporation, or to this Prospectus, or to any other agreement or contract. 
Each Seller will warrant to the Fund the existence and validity of the Mortgage Loans in 
the same manner as specified by articles 348 of the Commercial Code and 1,529 of the 
Civil Code. 
3.3.2. 
Issuance Price of the Participations and the Certificates 
The Sociedad Gestora, on the Date of Incorporation, will subscribe to 100% of the 
Participations and the Certificates on behalf of the Fund. 
The price of the Participations and the Certificates will be the Outstanding Nominal 
Balance thereof as of the Date of Incorporation and will be paid by the Sociedad Gestora, 
on behalf of and for the account of the Fund, to each Seller, on the Disbursement Date, 
which is 1 December 2005. 
In the event of termination of the incorporation of the Fund and, consequently, of the 
issuance and subscription of the Participations and of the Certificates, (i) the obligation of 
the Fund to pay for the Participations and the Certificates will be extinguished, and (ii) 
the Sociedad Gestora will be obligated to restore to the Sellers any right which may have 
accrued to the Fund by the subscription of the respective Participations and Certificates. 
In this event of the early termination of the Fund, the Sellers will undertake to meet any 
initial expenses that may have been incurred in incorporating the Fund, each one paying a 
percentage equivalent to its percentage participation in the issue of Mortgage 
Participations and Mortgage Transfer Certificates and taking into account any expenses 
that can attributed individually to each one of them.  
3.3.3. 
Description of the rights conferred upon the Fund for the subscription of the 
Mortgage Loan Participations and Certificates 
The Fund, as legal holder of the Participations and the Certificates, will hold the rights 
generally recognized by applicable law and in the Participations and the Certificates. 
Specifically, the Fund will be entitled to receive the payments which, beginning on the 
Date of Incorporation, are made by the Mortgagors, with the exceptions noted in the 
following paragraph, as well as any other payments arising from the Mortgage Loans, 
whenever they are made in accordance with the Participations and Certificates.  


This prospectus is a translation into English of the original "Folleto Informativo" drafted in Spanish language and registered with the 
"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores" (the Spanish Securities Market Commission, "CNMV") on November 25h, 2005. The "Folleto 
Informativo" drafted in the Spanish language is the only official document, and no document other than the "Folleto Informativo"shall have 
any legal effect or be relied upon with regard to the Note Issue. 
 
97 
In addition to the payments made by the Mortgagors, the Fund will be entitled to any 
other payment received by the Sellers on the Mortgage Loans, as administrators of these 
loans, including those arising from any right related to the loan such as those payments 
arising from insurance policies, payments made by possible guarantors, etc. with the 
exception of default interest, fees for the collection of unpaid amounts, assumption fees, 
early redemption/cancellation fees, as well as any other fee or payment to which the 
Sellers of the Participations and the Certificates are entitled.  
In addition, the Fund will be entitled to receive amounts, goods, or rights as payment of 
principal or interest on the Mortgage Loans, whether based on liquidation price or an 
amount determined by a court order or notarial procedure in the enforcement of a 
mortgage guarantee, by the transfer or liquidation of the real estate awarded or as a 
consequence of the aforementioned enforcement actions, as the acting administrator and 
manager of the properties in the process of foreclosure. The Sellers agree to provide the 
appropriate notifications that, depending on the case, are needed in order for said 
payments to be made to the Sociedad Gestora.  
The Sellers will exercise reasonable effort in order to maintain in full force and effect the 
insurance policies purchased relative to the Mortgage Loans, with each Seller being liable 
to the Fund for any loss sustained by the Fund in the event that the insurance policies are 
not maintained in full force and effect. 
 
3.3.4. 
Representation of the Participations and the Certificates and the deposit thereof 
The Participations and the Certificates that are pooled in the Fund will be represented by 
six (6) Multiple Certificates, three (3) Multiple Certificates issued, respectively, by CAJA 
CASTILLA LA MANCHA, CREDIFIMO and BANKPIME, representing all the 
Participations issued by each one of them, and three (3) Multiple Certificates issued, 
respectively, by CAJA CASTILLA LA MANCHA, CREDIFIMO and BANKPIME 
representing all the Certificates issued by each one of them. 
Both in the event that the Sociedad Gestora proceeds, on behalf and for the account of the 
Fund, to substitute a Mortgage Loan in accordance with the provisions of section 2.2.9 
(40).of the Additional Building Block, and in the event that a Mortgage Loan is 
foreclosed, in accordance with the provisions of section 3.7.1. of this Additional Building 
Block, and if, in the event of the Early Liquidation of the Fund, on the grounds and 
according to the terms set forth in section 4.4.3. of the Registration Document, the 
Participations and/or the Certificates have to be sold, and for any other circumstances 
which may arise, the Sellers undertake to divide any Multiple Certificate representing the 
Participations and/or the Certificates into as many individual or multiples certificates as 
may be required, or to substitute or exchange them, in order to achieve the 
aforementioned purposes. 
The Multiple Certificates representing the Participations and the Certificates and, in a 
given case, the individual certificates into which they have been divided, will remain on 
deposit with the Payment Agent who will act as the depository for them.  
3.3.5. 
Other legal system requirements for the Participations and the Certificates 
As established in Royal Decree 685/1982, the Participations and the Certificates will be 
transferable by written declaration on the security itself and, generally, by any of the

means legally allowed in accordance with the provisions of article 67.1 of Royal Decree 
685/1982, with the acquisition and ownership limited to institutional or professional 
investors and not permitted for the non-specialised public, as stipulated in article 64.1 of 
Royal Decree 685/1982. The purchaser must inform the issuer both of such a transfer and 
of the address of the new owner.  
The transferor will not be held responsible for the solvency of the issuing entity nor for 
that of the Mortgagor, nor likewise for the adequacy of the mortgage which secures it. 
3.3.6. 
Notification of the Mortgagors 
The Sellers will continue servicing the Mortgage Loans, in accordance with the 
provisions of section 3.7.1. of this Securities Note. The Sociedad Gestora and the Sellers 
will agree not to notify their respective Mortgagors of the transfer on the Date of 
Incorporation of the Fund. 
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sociedad Gestora will instruct the Sellers as to their 
obligation to notify the Mortgagors of the transfer of the Mortgage Loans, as and when it 
deems it appropriate, and in any case, in the event that the Sellers are substituted as the 
servicers of the Mortgage Loans, as well as in the event of the insolvency of the Sellers. 
The transfer must be notified by the reliable means of communications that the Sociedad 
Gestora considers fastest and most effective. 
3.4. 
Explanation of the flow of funds 
3.4.1. 
How the cash flow from the assets will meet the issuer’s obligations to the Security 
holders 
As illustrated in the diagram included in section 3.1. of this Additional Building Block, 
the cash flow from the assets will serve to fulfil the obligations of the issuer in the 
following manner: 
a) On the Disbursement Date, the Fund will pay the price of the Participations and of 
the Certificates issued, with a portion of the principal amount received from the 
Bonds. 
b) On said Disbursement Date, the Fund will also receive the amount of the Initial 
Expenses Loan, provided that the drawdown condition set forth in section 3.4.3.2. 
of the Additional Building Block is met. 
c) Likewise, on said Disbursement Date, the Reserve Fund will be established from a 
portion of the issuance price of the Securities. 
d) On each Collection Date corresponding to each Seller, the Sociedad Gestora, for 
and on behalf of the Fund, will receive the amounts that the Fund should receive 
respectively from each of the Sellers that have been paid by their Mortgagors for 
principal and interest during the Calculation Period. These amounts will remain on 
deposit in the Collection Account, earning interest, in accordance with the 
provisions of the Financial Services Contract, and will be utilized to meet the Fund 
payment requirements on each Payment Date. 
e) Technical Advance. Taking into account that a portion of the delays in the 
payment of an instalment by the Mortgagors can be of a temporary or technical 
nature, in order to prevent any such delays from negatively affecting the flow of

payments to the holders of the Securities issued, and in addition taking into 
account the existence of a 20 day difference between the end of the Calculation 
Period and the Calculation Date by the Fund during which period of time the 
amounts are collected by each Seller, as administrator of its respective Mortgage 
Loans, which belong to the Fund, the Sociedad Gestora will on each Calculation 
Date be entitled to draw, acting on behalf of and for the account of the Fund, a 
payment advance to be charged against said amounts.  
The amount of each Technical Advance will be an amount not greater than the 
amount collected by each Seller, from the Loans which it services, for any 
payments to which the Fund is entitled as holder of the Participations and the 
Certificates, from the end of the most recent Calculation Period until the 
Calculation Date on which the Technical Advance is requested. 
On each Calculation Date, the Technical Advance obtained on the previous 
Calculation Date will be considered deductible in the Calculation Period that is to 
be paid, and another Technical Advance may be requested from the next Technical 
Advance and charged to the next payment. 
f) The amounts received from the Mortgage Loans corresponding to the three (3) 
Collection Periods prior to the corresponding Payment Date, the amount of the 
Technical Advance, the interest accrued on the Collection Account, on the 
Treasury Account, on the Liquidity Line Sinking Account, and if applicable, on 
the Reinvestment Accounts and on the Treasury Surplus Account, the Net Amount 
which results in favour of the Fund pertaining to the Derivative Contracts and the 
amount which at any given moment comprises the Reserve Fund will be utilized 
on each Payment Date, to pay the accrued interest and repay principal on the 
Securities in accordance with the Payment Priority Order described in section 
3.4.6. of the Additional Building Block.  
3.4.2. 
Information on any credit enhancements 
As a mechanism for credit enhancement in the event of possible losses from unpaid 
and/or defaulted Mortgage Loans and for the purpose of allowing payments to be made 
by the Fund in accordance with the Payment Priority Order, a provision for the 
establishment of the Reserve Fund has been made, initially funded with a portion of the 
issuance price of the Securities. 
Similarly, the postponement in the payment of interest and the return of principal between 
the different Classes which results from their ranking in the Payment Priority Order, as 
well as the redemption rules for each of the Series established in section 4.9.2. of the 
Securities Note, constitute a protection mechanism between the different Classes. 
In order to eliminate the interest rate risk which exists due to the fact that the 
Participations and the Certificates are subject to variable interest rates based on different 
index rates and different adjustment periods and payment periods for the variable interest 
payments established for each of the Classes that are issued and paid by the Fund, the 
Sociedad Gestora will enter into three Derivative Contracts, described in section 3.4.7.1. 
of this Additional Building Block, with BSBP. 
In general, the quality of the Mortgage Loans and of the financial safeguards and controls, 
established in order to maintain the financial stability of the Fund, are such that they are 
considered sufficient by the Rating Agencies in order to assign the provisional solvency 
ratings to each one of the Securities that are included in section 7.5. of the Securities 
Note.

Details of any financing  
3.4.3.1 
Liquidity Line Contract 
The Sellers will grant, in accordance with the provisions of the Liquidity Line Contract, a 
liquidity line to the Fund (the “Liquidity Line”) for a total maximum amount of one 
million nine hundred and forty thousand (1,940,000) euros, equivalent to 0.4% of the 
original balance of the Bond issue, distributed among them in the following manner:  
 
 
CAJA CASTILLA LA MANCHA: 1,240,048 euros. 
 
 
CREDIFIMO: 
 
             519,920 euros. 
 
 
BANKPIME:                         
 180,032 euros. 
The maximum amount of the Liquidity Line will be made available on the Disbursement 
Date, and will be deposited in the Liquidity Line Sinking Account. 
On the first Payment Date, if necessary, the Sociedad Gestora will order a transfer from 
Liquidity Line Sinking Account to cover the shortfall that exists on that date between the 
interest accrued of the Participations and Certificates until that Payment Date and the 
interest collected on the Participations and Certificates, during the Calculation Periods 
prior to the first Payment Date. 
Where applicable, the remaining amounts not used to cover the shortfall indicated in the 
previous paragraph of this section and deposited in the Liquidity Line Sinking Account 
will also be transferred on the first Payment Date to the Treasury Account and will be 
used to repay part of the Liquidity Line on that date according to the Payment Priority 
Order.  
If, on the first Payment Date, the shortfall described above does not exist, the whole 
amount deposited in the Liquidity Line Sinking Account must be transferred to the 
Treasury Account on the first Payment Date, and such amount will be used to repay the 
whole of the Liquidity Line on that date according to the Payment Priority Order. 
The amounts drawn under the Liquidity Line and subject to repayment will accrue an 
interest rate equal to the rate that results from reducing the monthly average of the 
EONIA rates, calculated in accordance with the provisions of the Liquidity Line Contract, 
by fifteen (15) basis points, if the Liquidity Line has not been repaid in full on the first 
Payment Date. Such interest will be settled quarterly on each Payment Date and will be 
subject to the Payment Priority Order set forth in section 3.4.6. of the Additional Building 
Block.  
On each Payment Date, in accordance with the Payment Priority Order, an allocation will 
be made for the repayment of the Liquidity Line which will be accumulated in the 
Liquidity Line Sinking Fund deposited in the Liquidity Line Sinking Account, in the 
amount necessary so that, on each Payment Date, the balance of said Account will be 
equal to the amount resulting by applying to the amount available under the Liquidity 
Line and not repaid on the First Payment Date the percentage by which the Outstanding 
Nominal Balance under the Participations and Certificates has been reduced on the last 
day of the Calculation Period immediately prior to the corresponding Payment Date, 
relative to the Outstanding Nominal Balance on the Date of Incorporation. 
On the Payment Date on which the Outstanding Nominal Balance under the Participations 
and Certificates falls below 10% of the initial amount of the same:

Liquidity Line will be repaid in full, according to the Payment Priority Order, transferring 
therefore, on the Business Day prior to the Payment Date in question, the amounts 
deposited in the Liquidity Line Sinking Account to the Treasury Account. In the event 
that on said Payment Date there are not sufficient Available Funds to pay off the 
Liquidity Line in full, the payment will be made effective on the following Payment

The non-confirmation before the start of the Subscription Period of any of the provisional 
ratings assigned to the Bonds by the Rating Agencies as well as the occurrence of any 
other event that could lead to the termination of the incorporation of the Fund  will both 
be construed as grounds for termination of the Liquidity Line Contract. 
3.4.3.2 
Initial Expenses Loan Contract 
The Sellers will grant, in accordance with the provisions of the Initial Expenses Loan 
Contract, a loan to the Fund (the “Initial Expenses Loan”), for the purpose of meeting the 
initial expenses of the Fund, for a maximum amount equal to 1,079,505 Euros, which will 
be distributed among the Sellers as follows: 
 
CAJA CASTILLA LA MANCHA: 
686,007.42.- euros. 
        CREDIFIMO: 
                        
293,962.63.- euros.  
 
BANKPIME:                                
 
99,534.95.- euros. 
In the event that, once the definitive amount of the NAS-IO securities has been 
established, it is found that the proceeds from the Securities issued will be enough to 
cover both the price of the Mortgage Loans, the allocation of the Reserve Fund (as 
established in section 3.4.3.3.) and the payment of the initial expenses of the Fund, the 
Initial Expenses Loan will not be made available and the Initial Expenses Loan Contract 
will be terminated. Be that as it may, the termination of the Initial Expenses Contract on 
these grounds will not imply any additional expense for the Fund. 
Therefore the definitive amount of the Initial Expenses Loan or, where applicable, the 
termination of such Loan, will be determined by the Sociedad Gestora on 29 November 
2005, once the definitive amount of the NAS-IO Securities has been determined as 
described in section 4.2. of the Securities Note. The Sociedad Gestora will proceed to 
notify the final amount of the Initial Expenses Loan or, where applicable, the termination 
of the Contract, before 14:00 (CET time) on 29 November 2005, before the start of the 
Subscription Period. The final amount of the Initial Expenses Loan will be delivered, 
where applicable, on the Disbursement Date by means of a deposit into the Treasury 
Account. The final amount of the Initial Expenses Loan or, where applicable, the 
termination of such Loan, will be documented in the notarized disbursement document. 
The amount of the Initial Expenses Loan will be used by the Sociedad Gestora for the 
purpose of paying the initial expenses of the Fund incurred  in the incorporation of the 
Fund and the issuance of the Securities. 
If the Initial Expenses Loan is used, the interest on it will be calculated based on an 
annual interest rate, adjusted quarterly, equal to the Reference Interest Rate of the 
Securities in force from time to time. This interest will be paid only if the Fund has 
sufficient liquidity available according to the Payment Priority Order. The interest will be 
settled on each Payment Date, and will be calculated on the following basis: (i) the actual 
effective days in each Interest Accrual Period and (ii) a 360 day year 
The Loan principal will be repaid in 20 equal and consecutive instalments, the first of 
which will be paid on the first Payment Date (March 22, 2006) and the remaining ones on 
the following Payment Dates, all being subject to the Payment Priority Order described in 
section 3.4.6. of the Additional Building Block. 
The non-confirmation before the start of the Subscription Period of one of the provisional 
ratings assigned to the Securities by the Rating Agencies will be construed as grounds for

termination of the Initial Expenses Loan Contract, as will the occurrence of any other 
event that could lead to the termination of the incorporation of the Fund. 
All of the amounts that are to be paid to the Sellers, whether for the payment of accrued 
interest or for the repayment of principal, pertaining to the Initial Expenses Loan, will be 
subject to the Payment Priority Order described in section 3.4.6. of the Additional 
Building Block.  
All of the amounts which, as specified in the prior paragraphs, have not been paid to the 
Sellers will be paid on the following Payment Dates in which the Available Funds permit 
said payment according to the Payment Priority Order established and will be paid in 
preference to the amounts required to be paid under the Initial Expenses Loan on said 
Payment Date. 
The amounts owing to the Sellers and remaining unpaid according to the provisions of the 
prior paragraphs will not accrue default interest in their favour. 
3.4.3.3 
Reserve Fund 
As a security measure and for the purpose of allowing payments to be made by the Fund 
according to the Payment Priority Order described in section 3.4.6. of the Additional 
Building Block, a reserve fund will be established entitled “Reserve Fund”. 
The Reserve Fund will be initially established on the Disbursement Date, funded by a 
portion of the issuance price of the Securities, after having paid in full the price of the 
Participations and the Certificates, in the amount of THREE MILLION NINE 
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND (3,977,000) euros. 
On each Payment Date, the resources available on each Payment Date for that purpose, 
according to the Payment Priority Order, will be allocated to the Reserve Fund until the 
required level is reached for that Payment Date (hereafter referred to as the “Required 
Level”). 
The Required Level will be the lesser of the following amounts: 
- 0.82% of the initial amount of the Bond issuance. 
- 1.64% of the Outstanding Nominal Balance of the Bond issuance.  
The Reserve Fund must not be reduced in the event that any of the following 
circumstances exists: 
1) 
That the Reserve Fund is not at its Required Level as of the prior Payment 
Date. 
2) 
That the Outstanding Nominal Balance of the Participations and the 
Certificates that are past due for 90 days or more exceeds 1% of the 
Outstanding Nominal Balance of the Participations and the Certificates. 
3) 
That 3 years have not elapsed since the Date of Incorporation. 
In any event, the Required Level of the Reserve Fund must not fall below 0.5% of the 
initial balance of the Bond issuance. 
The amounts which make up the Reserve Fund will be deposited in the Treasury Account 
under the terms referred to in section 3.4.4.2. of the Additional Building Block.

3.4.4. 
Parameters for the investment of temporary liquidity surpluses and a description of 
the parties responsible for such investment 
The investment parameters for the liquidity surpluses of the Fund are listed in the 
Financial Services Contract. 
3.4.4.1 
Collection Account  
The Fund will have available through the Payment Agent, in accordance with the 
provisions of the Financial Services Contract, a bank account on behalf of the Fund (the 
“Collection Account”), through which it will accept on each Collection Date, from each 
Seller, in accordance with the dates stipulated in section 4.9.2.2. of the Securities Note, all 
of the payments that the Fund should receive from each of the Sellers respectively 
resulting from the loans which it services. 
CAJA CASTILLA LA MANCHA and CREDIFIMO will make their payments on a 
weekly basis, each Tuesday or, if is not a Business Day, on the immediately next 
Business Day. BANKPIME will make its payments on the 4th and 19th of each month or, 
if either of these is not a Business Day, the immediately next Business Day.  
Nevertheless, should the short-term debt rating assigned to the Sellers by either of the 
Rating Agencies have a negative effect on the Bond rating assigned by such Rating 
Agency, the Sellers will make their deposits on a daily basis. 
Additionally, in the event that the rating of CAJA DE AHORROS PROVINCIAL DE 
SAN FERNANDO DE SEVILLA Y JEREZ, in its capacity as the parent company of 
CREDIFIMO, assigned by any of the Rating Agencies to its subordinated and unsecured 
debt, is downgraded below F2, on the Fitch short-term rating scale and/or below A-, on 
the Fitch long-term rating scale, or else the aforementioned entity ceases to own 51% of 
the shares into which the share capital of CREDIFIMO are divided, and in such an event 
another entity with the same or higher ratings as CAJA DE AHORROS PROVINCIAL 
DE SAN FERNANDO DE SEVILLA Y JEREZ on the long-term and short-term rating 
scales of Fitch does not gain control of  51% of the shares into which the share capital of 
CREDIFIMO is divided, the latter must make its deposits on a daily basis. 
Additionally, in the event that the rating assigned by Fitch to the non-subordinated and 
unsecured debt of CAJA CASTILLA LA MANCHA is downgraded to a rating equal to 
F2, on the Fitch short-term rating scale, CAJA CASTILLA LA MANCHA will make its 
deposits on alternate days, instead of every week. If the rating assigned to that entity 
downgraded below F1, according to the Fitch scale, CAJA CASTILLA LA MANCHA 
will make its deposits on a daily basis and, additionally, must obtain a guarantee similar 
to the one described in section 3.4.4.3. (iii) of this Additional Building Block. 
The amounts that have been deposited in the Collection Account and that represent the 
total collected amount, derived from the mortgage loans serviced by each of the Sellers 
during the calendar month prior to each Calculation Date (hereafter referred to as 
“Collected Amount”) will be deposited, along with the corresponding Technical 
Advance, into the Treasury Account before 11:30 (CET time) on the corresponding 
Calculation Date, with good value as of that same date.  
The earnings on the Collection Account will be transferred on each Payment Date to the 
Treasury Account. 
The Collection Account will not be allowed to have a negative balance to the detriment of 
the Fund.

105 
The amounts deposited into the Collection Account will accrue interest on behalf of the 
Fund, with said interest to be paid monthly (on the last day of each month), calculated 
based on an annual interest rate equal to the rate that results from reducing the reference 
rate, which will be the monthly average of the EONIA rates, calculated in accordance 
with the provisions of the Financial Services Contract, by fifteen (15) basis points. Said 
amount will be rounded up to the nearest hundredth.  
In the event that the short-term risk rating of the Payment Agent assigned by any of the 
Rating Agencies, which is currently listed as F1+ by Fitch and A-1 by S&P, were 
downgraded to a rating lower than F1 according to the Fitch rating system and/or lower 
than A-1 according to S&P, or if that rating were to be discontinued, for whatever reason, 
by any of the Rating Agencies, the Sociedad Gestora must initiate, on behalf of the Fund, 
the options described in section 5.2 of the Securities Note. 
In the event that, at any given moment, the balance in the Collection Account, together 
with the balance of the Treasury Account and the balance of the Liquidity Line Sinking 
Account, were to be greater than or equal to 20% of the Outstanding Nominal Amount of 
the Bonds, the Sociedad Gestora will move such excess, until the following Payment 
Date, at which time it will be returned to the appropriate account to be applied, into an 
account with an entity whose short term unsubordinated and unsecured debt is rated A-1+ 
by S&P and F1 by Fitch, seeking to obtain the highest earnings possible on these 
balances. (Hereafter, the account which is opened, in accordance with the provisions 
immediately preceding in this paragraph, will be referred to as the “Treasury Surplus 
Account”). 
In the event that the short term debt rating for this entity in which the Treasury Surplus 
Account is opened is downgraded below A-1+, according to the S&P rating system and 
F1, according to the Fitch rating system, the Sociedad Gestora will have a period of thirty 
(30) days to find a substitute entity whose short term unsubordinated and unsecured debt 
is rated A-1+ by S&P and F1 by Fitch, or a guarantee payable on demand from an entity 
whose short term debt is rated A-1+ by S&P and F1 by Fitch. 
3.4.4.2 
Treasury Account 
The Fund will have available through the Payment Agent, in accordance with the 
provisions in the Financial Services Contract, a bank account on behalf of the Fund 
(hereafter referred to as “Treasury Account”).  
On each Calculation Date, the Fund will transfer to the Treasury Account all of the 
receipts which the Fund should receive of the Sellers from the Collection Account, in 
accordance with the provisions of the previous section and of the Articles of 
Incorporation. 
The allocation for the Reserve Fund and the Net Amounts in favour of the Fund from the 
Derivative Contracts will also be placed into the Treasury Account.  
Likewise, on the Disbursement Date, each Seller will deposit, where applicable, the actual 
amount which corresponds to the Initial Expenses Loan.   
On the first Payment Date the Fund will have available the amounts under the Liquidity 
Line that will be transferred from the Liquidity Line Sinking Account. 
All payments from the Fund will be transacted through the Treasury Account, following 
instructions from the Sociedad Gestora.

The Treasury Account will not be allowed to have a negative balance to the detriment of 
the Fund. The balances in the Treasury Account will remain as available cash  
The amounts deposited into the Collection Account will accrue interest on behalf of the 
Fund, with said interest to be paid monthly (on the first day of each month), calculated 
based on an annual interest rate equal to the rate that results from reducing the Collection 
Account reference rate, which will be the monthly average of the EONIA rates, calculated 
in accordance with the provisions of the Financial Services Contract, by fifteen (15) basis 
points. 
In the event that, at any given moment, the balance in the Collection Account, together 
with the balance of the Treasury Account and the balance of the Liquidity Line Sinking 
Account, were to be greater than or equal to 20% of the Outstanding Nominal Amount of 
the Bonds, the Sociedad Gestora will transfer such excess into the Treasury Surplus 
Account, pursuant to the provisions of section 3.4.4.1. immediately above. 
In the event that the short-term risk rating of the Payment Agent assigned by any of the 
Rating Agencies, which is currently listed as F1+ by Fitch and A-1 by S&P, were 
downgraded to below F1 on the Fitch rating scale and/or below A-1 on the S&P rating 
scale, or if that rating were to be withdrawn, for whatever reason, by any of the Rating 
Agencies, the Sociedad Gestora must initiate the same actions as those established for the 
Collection Account. 
3.4.4.3 
Reinvestment Accounts 
In the event that one of the Sellers were to obtain a rating equal to the highest short term 
rating assigned by both Ratings Agencies, S&P and Fitch, the Sociedad Gestora, after 
informing the CNMV, will proceed to open a bank account on behalf of the Fund at the 
corresponding Seller (the “Rated Seller”), called a “Reinvestment Account”, which will 
be used to receive, on each Collection Date, all of the amounts which the Fund should 
receive from that Seller. The Rated Seller will enter into a contract with the Sociedad 
Gestora, with the latter acting on behalf of and for the account of the Fund, which will 
control the handling of the Reinvestment Account.  
The regulation stipulated in this section must not refer to CREDIFIMO, because, in its 
capacity as a financial credit establishment, it cannot open current accounts. 
In the event that the Seller becomes a Rated Seller, the proportional share of the Reserve 
Fund which has been assigned to it will be added to the Reinvestment Account, from the 
Treasury Account, on the following Payment Date.  
The Rated Seller will provide to the Fund all of the customary services relating to the 
maintenance and administration of said account, in accordance with normal banking 
practices. The Rated Sellers will not charge the Fund any bank charges for the respective 
Reinvestment Accounts. 
The positive balances in favour of the Fund, if any, which occur in the Reinvestment 
Accounts will accrue interest, which will be payable quarterly (on the Business day prior 
to each Payment Date) at a variable rate equal to the Reference Interest Rate EURIBOR. 
With prior instructions from the Sociedad Gestora, on the Business Day prior to each 
Payment Date, the Rated Seller will make the necessary transfers in order to meet the 
obligations of the Fund through the Payment Agent. 
In the event that the rating assigned by either of the Rating Agencies to the short-term risk 
of the Rated Seller is downgraded below F1, according to the rating scale of Fitch and/or

to below A-1+, according to the rating scale of S&P, or either of the Rating Agencies 
withdraws such rating for any reason, the Sociedad Gestora will urge the Rated Seller to 
implement, within the thirty (30) days following such downgrade, the options necessary 
from among those described below, in terms of the severity of the rating downgrade, and 
pursuant to the provisions of the three last paragraphs of this section, in order to maintain 
the rating assigned to the Securities:  
(i)  obtain a first demand bank guarantee, from a bank with the two aforementioned 
ratings, that guarantees to the Fund, at the simple request of the Sociedad Gestora, the 
timely payment by the Rated Seller of its obligation to reimburse the amounts deposited 
in the Reinvestment Account; 
(ii) deposit the revenues of the Participations and the Certificates, once a week (every 
five (5) Business Days), into the Reinvestment Account; 
(iii) obtain a guarantee that guarantees that the amounts collected by the Rated Seller as 
the servicer of the Mortgage Loans are deposited into the Reinvestment Account, and that 
covers, at the simple request of the Sociedad Gestora, in favour of the Fund, an amount 
not exceeding 0.65% of the initial balance of the Securities issue; 
(iv) deposit the revenues of the Participations and the Certificates, every two (2) days, 
into the Reinvestment Account; 
(v) deposit the revenues of the Participations and the Certificates, every day into the 
Reinvestment Account; and 
(vi) find an entity with a short-term rating of F1, on the Fitch rating scale, and A-1+, on 
the S&P rating scale, that is willing to take over, under the same terms and conditions, the 
duties of the Rated Seller in relation to the Reinvestment Account. 
If the rating of the Rated Seller is downgraded below A-1+, on the S&P rating scale, it 
must implement the options described in points (i) and (ii) jointly, or else the options 
described in sections (ii) and (vi) jointly. 
If the Rated Seller's rating is F2 on the Fitch scale, the options described in sections (i), 
(iii) and (iii) must be implemented; or else the options described in sections (i) and (iv), or 
the options described in sections (iv), (vi). 
If the Rated Seller's rating is F3 on the Fitch scale, or in the event that such Seller ceases 
to be rated by Fitch, the options described in sections (i), (iii) and (v) must be 
implemented; or else the options described in sections (ii), (iii) and (vi). 
As of the signing of the Articles of Incorporation, none of the Sellers has a rating high 
enough, in accordance with the specifications of this section, to open a Reinvestment 
Account. 
3.4.4.4 
Liquidity Line Sinking Account 
The Fund will have available through the Payment Agent, in accordance with the 
provisions of the Financial Services Contract, a bank account on behalf of the Fund 
(“Liquidity Line Sinking Account”). 
On the Disbursement Date the whole amount of the Liquidity Line will be deposited into 
the Liquidity Line Sinking Account pursuant to the provisions of section 3.4.3.1. of the 
Additional Building Block.

The Fund will transfer to the Liquidity Line Sinking Account, on each Payment Date, and 
in keeping with the Available Funds, the amount determined according to section 3.4.3.1 
of this Additional Building Block. 
The Sociedad Gestora will order transfers from the Liquidity Line Sinking Account to the 
Treasury Account in the following instances and in the amounts indicated as follows: 
(1) The Sociedad Gestora will transfer to the Treasury Account, with good value on the 
Business Day immediately prior to a specified Payment Date, those amounts which, as the 
case may be, are necessary to meet the payment obligations specified in sections (1) to 
(14) of the Payment Priority Order, both inclusive, from funds which are held in the 
Liquidity Line Sinking Account. 
(2) On the Payment Date in which the Outstanding Nominal Balance of the 
Participations and the Certificates falls below 10% of the initial balance of the same and 
the Sociedad Gestora opts for the early termination of the Fund, the entire amount of the 
funds held in the Liquidity Line Sinking Account will be transferred to the Treasury 
Account. 
(3) On the Payment Date on which the Saldo Nominal Pendiente de Cobro of the 
Participations and the Certificates is equal to or less than 6.1% of the initial balance 
thereof, on which date the Liquidity Line will be repaid in full in accordance with the 
provisions of section 3.4.3.1 of the current Additional Building Block, the entire amount 
of the funds held in the Liquidity Line Sinking Account will be transferred to the 
Treasury Account. 
(4) Additionally, on the first Payment Date the maximum amount of the Liquidity Line 
will be transferred to the Treasury Account, and applied according to the provisions of 
section 3.4.3.1. of the Additional Building Block, and the amounts not required to cover 
the shortfall will be repaid on the first Payment Date according to the Payment Priority 
Order, and the full amount of the Liquidity Line may be repaid if there is no shortfall, as 
described in section 3.4.3.1. of this Additional Building Block. 
The balance in the Liquidity Line Sinking Account will be held in available cash. The 
balance in the Liquidity Line Sinking Account, for the account of the Fund, cannot be 
used, in any manner, by the Payment Agent, to offset any kind of amount owed to it by 
the Fund or by related third parties, unless prior written approval from the Sociedad 
Gestora has been obtained. 
The amounts deposited into the Liquidity Line Sinking Account will accrue interest on 
behalf of the Fund, with said interest to be paid monthly (on the last day of each month), 
calculated based on a variable annual interest rate equal to the rate that results from 
reducing the Collection Account reference rate, which will be the monthly average of the 
EONIA rates, calculated in accordance with the provisions of the Financial Services 
Contract, by fifteen (15) basis points, which will be transferred to the Treasury Account 
on the Business Day prior to each Payment Date. 
3.4.5. 
How payments are collected in respect of the assets 
As has been indicated in the Additional Building Block, the payments received from the 
Mortgagors will be deposited into the Collection Account on each Collection Date. The 
Sellers, in accordance with the provisions of section 3.7.1 of the Additional Building 
Block, and acting in their capacity as administrators of the Mortgage Loans assigned to 
the Fund, will not make any payment to the Fund that they have not previously received 
from the Mortgagors.

Other arrangements upon which payments of interest and principal to investors are 
dependent 
3.4.7.1 
Derivative Contracts 
The Sociedad Gestora will enter into, on behalf of and for account of the Fund, three 
Derivative Contracts (one quarterly Derivative Contract, one semi-annual Derivative 
Contract, and one annual Derivative Contract) with BSBP, whose most relevant terms are 
described below. 
The signing of the Derivative Contracts addresses, on one hand, the need to hedge against 
the interest rate risk that exists between the assets (Participations and Certificates) and the 
liabilities (Securities) of the Fund and, on the other hand, the interest rate risk that exists 
as a result of the rate caps and floors stipulated in a percentage of the Mortgage Loans 
pooled in the Fund. 
The parent company of BSBP, TBSCI, will guarantee the obligations of BSBP as 
counterparty to the Derivative Contracts. 
Party A: BSBP. 
Party B: The Sociedad Gestora, on behalf of and for the account of the Fund.  
Settlement Dates:  
The settlement dates will coincide with the Payment Dates, in other words, the 22nd day of 
the months of March, June, September, and December of each year or, if that day is not a 
Business Day, on the next Business Day. The first Payment Day of the Fund will be 22 
March 2006. 
Settlement Periods 
The settlement periods will be the number of days that actually pass between two 
consecutive Settlement Dates, including the first one but excluding the last one. By way 
of exception, the duration of the first contract period will be equivalent to the number of

114 
days that actually pass between the Bond Issue Disbursement Date (inclusive) and 22 
March 2006 (exclusive). 
Annual Derivative Contract 
Amount Payable by Party A on account of the Swap (Annual Derivative Contract) 
The Amount Payable by Party A is the result of multiplying the “Notional Amount of the 
Annual Derivative Contract”, as it is later defined, by the Reference Interest Rate 
established for each Payment Date, as defined in section 4.8 of the Securities Note, 
adjusted by a spread of between –0.06/0%, which must be set by Party A on the Date of 
Incorporation of the Fund and included in the Annual Derivative Contract that is signed 
on that date. In the absence of such notice, the spread will be set at 0%. The Party A 
calculation will be based on the number of days that actually pass with respect to a 360-
day year. At the same time the Sociedad Gestora will also notify the CNMV of this 
additional information to the Prospectus. 
The “Notional Amount of the Annual Derivative Contract” will be the Outstanding 
Nominal Balance of the Non-Defaulted Participations and Certificates that are pooled in 
the Fund and whose interest rate is adjusted annually, on the last day of the Calculation 
Period to the immediately preceding Payment Date. 
Amount Payable by Party B on account of the Swap (Annual Derivative Contract) 
The Amount to be Paid by Party B will be the product, based on the number of days that 
actually pass with respect to a 360-day year, of the “Notional Amount of the Annual 
Derivative Contract”, previously defined, multiplied by the “Swap Calculation Factor”. 
The “Swap Calculation Factor” will be the average 12 month EURIBOR rate for the 
twelve months prior to the beginning of Calculation Period, applying the weightings that 
are indicated in the Annual Derivative Contract.  
Amount Payable by Party A on account of the Cap (Annual Derivative Contract) 
On each Settlement Date, Party A will make a compensatory payment to Party B defined 
in such a way as to mitigate the flows being reduced by the amount that the Party B will 
stop receiving from the Mortgage Loans, that revise their interest rates each year and are 
subject to an Interest Rate Cap, due to the fact of being subject to those interest rate caps. 
The exact methodology used to calculate this amount is defined in the pertinent 
Derivative Contract. 
Amount Payable by Party B on account of the Floor (Annual Derivative Contract) 
On each Settlement Date, Party B will make a compensatory payment to Party A, defined 
in such a way that it is equivalent to the amount that Party A will receive additionally 
from the Mortgage Loans, that revise their interest rates each year and are subject to an 
Interest Rate Floor, due to the fact of being subject to those interest rate floors. The exact 
methodology used to calculate this amount is defined in the pertinent Derivative Contract. 
Semi-Annual Derivative Contract 
Amount Payable by Party A on account of the Swap (Semi-Annual Derivative Contract) 
The Amount Payable by Party A is the result of multiplying the “Notional Amount of the 
Semi-Annual Derivative Contract”, as it is later defined, by the Reference Interest Rate 
established for each Payment Date, as defined in section 4.8 of the Securities Note, 
adjusted by a spread of between +0.02/+0.08%, which must be set by Party A on the Date 
of Incorporation of the Fund and included in the Semi-Annual Derivative Contract that is

signed on that date.  In the absence of such notice, the spread will be set at +0.02%. The 
Party A calculation will be based on the number of days that actually pass with respect to 
a 360-day year. 
At the same time the Sociedad Gestora will also notify the CNMV of this additional 
information to the Prospectus. 
The “Notional Amount of the Semi-annual Derivative Contract” will be the 
Outstanding Nominal Balance of the Non-Defaulted Participations and Certificates that 
are pooled in the Fund and whose interest rate is adjusted semi-annually, on the last day 
of the Calculation Period to the immediately preceding Payment Date. 
Amount Payable by Party B on account of the Swap (Semi-Annual Derivative Contract) 
The Amount to be Paid by Party B will be the product, based on the number of days that 
actually pass with respect to a 360-day year, of the “Notional Amount of the Semi-annual 
Derivative Contract”, previously defined, multiplied by the “Swap Calculation Factor”. 
The “Swap Calculation Factor” will be the average 6 month EURIBOR rate for the six 
months prior to the beginning of Calculation Period, applying the considerations that are 
indicated in the Semi Annual Derivative Contract. 
Amount Payable by Party A on account of the Cap (Semi-Annual Derivative Contract) 
On each Settlement Date, Party A will make a compensatory payment to Party B defined 
in such a way as to mitigate the flows being reduced by the amount that the Party B will 
stop receiving from the Mortgage Loans, that revise their interest rates every six months 
and are subject to an Interest Rate Cap, due to the fact of being subject to those interest 
rate caps. The exact methodology used to calculate this amount is defined in the pertinent 
Derivative Contract. 
Amount Payable by Party B on account of the Floor (Semi-Annual Derivative Contract) 
On each Settlement Date, Party B will make a compensatory payment to Party A, defined 
in such a way that it is equivalent to the amount that Party A will receive additionally 
from the Mortgage Loans, that revise their interest rates every six months and are subject 
to an Interest Rate Floor, due to the fact of being subject to those interest rate floors. The 
exact methodology used to calculate this amount is defined in the pertinent Derivative 
Contract. 
Quarterly Derivative Contract 
Amount Payable by Party A on account of the Swap (Quarterly Derivative Contract) 
The Amount Payable by Party A is the result of multiplying the “Notional Amount of the 
Quarterly Derivative Contract”, as it is later defined, by the Reference Interest Rate 
established for each Payment Date, as defined in section 4.8 of the Securities Note, 
adjusted by a spread of between 0/0.06%, which must be set by Party A on the Date of 
Incorporation of the Fund and included in the Quarterly Derivative Contract that is signed 
on that date.  In the absence of such notice, the spread will be set at 0%. The Party A 
calculation will be based on the number of days that actually pass with respect to a 360-
day year. 
At the same time the Sociedad Gestora will also notify the CNMV of this additional 
information to the Prospectus.

the Fund and whose interest rate is adjusted quarterly, on the last day of the Calculation 
Period to the immediately preceding Payment Date. 
Amount Payable by Party B on account of the Swap (Quarterly Derivative Contract) 
The Amount to be Paid by Party B will be the product, based on the number of days that 
actually pass with respect to a 360-day year, of the “Notional Amount of the Quarterly 
Derivative Contract”, previously defined, multiplied by the “Swap Calculation Factor” . 
The “Swap Calculation Factor” will be the average 3 month EURIBOR rate for the 
three months prior to the beginning of Calculation Period, applying the considerations 
that are indicated in the Annual Derivative Contract. 
Amount Payable by Party A on account of the Cap (Quarterly Derivative Contract) 
On each Settlement Date, Party A will make a compensatory payment to Party B defined 
in such a way as to mitigate the flows being reduced by the amount that the Party B will 
stop receiving from the Mortgage Loans, that revise their interest rates each quarter and 
are subject to an Interest Rate Cap, due to the fact of being subject to those interest rate 
caps. The exact methodology used to calculate this amount is defined in the pertinent 
Derivative Contract. 
Amount Payable by Party B on account of the Floor (Quarterly Derivative Contract) 
On each Settlement Date, Party B will make a compensatory payment to Party A, defined 
in such a way that it is equivalent to the amount that Party A will receive additionally 
from the Mortgage Loans, that revise their interest rates quarterly and are subject to an 
Interest Rate Floor, due to the fact of being subject to those interest rate floors. The exact 
methodology used to calculate this amount is defined in the pertinent Derivative Contract. 
In the event of default under the Derivative Contract 
 
Breaches of the Derivative Contracts 
If on the Settlement Date Party B does not pay the amount owed to Party A, the 
corresponding Derivative Contract may be terminated at the request of Party A. In the 
event that a settlement amount is owed, Party A will, if applicable, assume the obligation 
to pay the settlement amount specified under the terms of the corresponding Derivative 
Contract, all in accordance with the Payment Priority Order.  
If on a Payment Date Party A does not meet its payment obligations for the full amount 
that is owed to Party B, the Sociedad Gestora can choose to terminate the corresponding 
Derivative Contract. In this case, (i) Party A will assume the obligation to pay the 
settlement amount specified under the terms of the corresponding Derivative Contract and 
(ii), any amounts payable by Party B to Party A, in accordance with the provisions of the 
corresponding Derivative Contract, will be paid according to the Fund Payment Priority 
Order. 
Notwithstanding the above, except in a situation involving a permanent change in the 
financial equilibrium of the Fund, the Sociedad Gestora, on behalf of and for the account 
of the Fund, will make every effort to always have in place three derivatives contracts 
(one for the Mortgage Loans whose interest rates adjust annually, another for the 
Mortgage Loans whose interest rates adjust semi-annually, and another for the Mortgage 
Loans whose interest rates adjust quarterly).

The settlement amount for each Derivative Contract will be calculated by Party A, as the 
calculation agent for the Derivative Contracts, based on the market value of the 
corresponding Derivative Contract. 
Termination of the Derivative Contracts 
The early termination of the Derivative Contracts, should it occur, will not, per se, 
constitute sufficient cause for the early termination of the Fund nor for the Early 
Liquidation thereof, unless in combination with other events or circumstances relating to 
the net worth of the Fund, a substantial or permanent change occurs in its financial 
equilibrium. 
The Derivative Contracts will expire on the earlier of (i) the Legal Maturity Date of the 
Fund and (ii) the Date of the Dissolution of the Fund, in accordance with the provisions 
set forth in section 4.4 of the Registration Document. 
The non-confirmation before the start of the Subscription Period of one of the provisional 
ratings assigned to the Bonds by the Rating Agencies will be construed as grounds for 
termination of the Derivative Contracts. 
The Derivative Contracts will also be terminated in the event of the occurrence, before the 
start of the Subscription Period, an event that could not be foreseen or that, despite being 
foreseeable, could not be avoided and makes it impossible to perform the Fund's 
Contracts pursuant to the provisions of section 1,105 of the Civil Code. 
Rating change events 
In the event that the rating of the unsecured and non-subordinated short-term debt of

*On 12 September 2005, Credifimo agreed a Euros 3,500,000 rights issue, which was disbursed 
during the month of September. The rights issue was put on public record on 4 October 2005 
before the Notary Public of Madrid Mr. Ignacio Martínez-Gil Vich under number 3,935 of his 
Official Record and registered at the Mercantile Registry on 26 October 2005, in Volume 
19,436, Folio 203, Section 8, Sheet M-104222. The main purpose of the rights issue was to 
achieve the level of equity required by the Bank of Spain and that had not been achieved prior to 
the rights issue because adjusting the accounts in accordance with the new Circular 4/2004 
implied an increase of the Lending figure (by adding to the balance sheet certain securitized 
credit rights that had been previously been removed in accordance with Circular 4/1991) and a 
decrease in the entity's reserves.

will exercise a reasonable level of skill, care and diligence in rendering its services.

Incorporation for the servicing of the Mortgage Loans, although it may modify such 
criteria provided that such modifications do not impair the servicing of the Mortgage 
Loans, are reported to the Sociedad Gestora and are not, in any way, detrimental to the

adjustments of such amount.

Actions against the Mortgagors 
In the event of delay in the payments to which Mortgagors are bound under the 
transferred Mortgage Loans, each Seller, as administrator of such Mortgage Loans, will

measures that a reasonably prudent mortgagee conducting financing transactions in Spain

the Fund, as their holder, will be entitled to exercise all the rights set forth in Article 66 of

Loans it services, and allocated to the Fund, within the following ten (10) Business Days

as offered to the Sociedad Gestora.

section, the Fund, through the Sociedad Gestora, will be entitled to bring a declaratory 
action against such Seller for breaching its obligations in relation to the Mortgage Loans,

126 
Where permitted under the current legal framework, each Seller will be entitled to 
subcontract with, or delegate on, third parties of recognized solvency and capacity vis-à-
vis the performance of the duties set forth in Clause 10 of the Articles of Incorporation, 
relating to the Mortgage Loans it services, provided that this is legally allowed and (i) the 
Sociedad Gestora gives its prior written consent, on behalf of the Fund, (ii) the 
subcontractor or delegate has been assigned a rating equal or higher to the rating required 
by the Rating Agencies and provided that (iii) such subcontractor or delegate has waived 
any action claiming liability against the Fund. 
In any case, neither the Sociedad Gestora nor the Fund will be held liable in any other 
way than pursuant to the provisions contained herein, regarding costs and expenses 
payable or incurred on account of the subcontracted or delegated services or arising from 
the termination of any related Contract. 
Be that as it may, no subcontract or delegation will free or release the Seller in question 
from any liability assumed by virtue of the Articles of Incorporation.  
5. 
Substitution of the Sellers as the Mortgage Loan administrators 
Should the Sociedad Gestora find that any Seller is in breach of the obligations stipulated 
in this section as administrator of the respective Mortgage Loans, or find about any events 
that, in the opinion of the Sociedad Gestora, imply a detriment or risk for the financial 
structure of the Fund or the rights and interests of Security holders, the Sociedad Gestora 
may, if permitted under the current legal framework, (i) substitute the Seller in question 
as administrator of the Mortgage Loans or (ii) demand that the Seller in question 
subcontract or delegate the performance of such obligations to or on a person who, in the 
opinion of the Sociedad Gestora, is suitably qualified technically to perform such duties. 
The Sociedad Gestora will consider any proposals made by the Seller in question 
regarding the appointment of its substitute. The Seller will be bound to execute such 
subcontract or delegation. 
Furthermore, if a corporate, legal or court decision is made or issued for the dissolution, 
winding-up or receivership of any Seller, or any Seller files a petition to be declared 
bankrupt, or a Court allows a request filed by a third party, the Sociedad Gestora will 
substitute the pertinent Seller as administrator of the Mortgage Loans, providing that this 
is permitted by the applicable Law. 
If permitted by the applicable Law, the new administrator of the Mortgage Loans will, 
where applicable, be appointed by the Sociedad Gestora, after consulting the competent 
administrative authorities, in order to avoid any detriment to the rating assigned to the 
Securities by the Ratings Agencies, who will be notified of such appointment. The 
Sociedad Gestora may agree the amount to be paid with the new administrator, at the 
expense of the Fund and, specifically, payable from the individual account of the Seller in 
question, as it deems appropriate. Such amount will be deemed an extraordinary expense 
and will be paid pursuant to the Payment Priority Order.  
If permitted by the applicable Law, any Seller may request to be substituted in servicing 
the Mortgage Loans; all expenses incurred in such substitution will be at the Seller’s 
expense. The Sociedad Gestora will authorize such substitution, provided that the 
requesting Seller has found an entity to substitute it in its servicing capacity, and such 
substitution is not detrimental to the rating assigned to the Securities by the Rating 
Agencies, who will be notified of such appointment. 
In the event of substitution, the substituted Seller will supply the new administrator with 
the documents necessary to provides the services in question.

6. 
Modifications to the Mortgage Loans 
Pursuant to article 25 of Royal Decree 685/1982, dated 17 March, without the consent of 
the Sociedad Gestora and with respect to the respective Mortgage Loans that they service, 
none of the Sellers will voluntarily cancel the mortgages on any grounds other than the 
payment of the Mortgage Loans, waive or settle such mortgages, substitute the Mortgage 
Loans through novation, write them off in full or part or defer them nor, in general, take 
any step that diminishes the range, legal efficiency or economic value of the mortgage or 
the Mortgage Loans , with the exception of the authorized modifications mentioned in the 
next paragraph. 
Each Seller, as administrator of its respective Mortgage Loans, will be authorized, from 
the Date of Incorporation and with respect to such Mortgage Loans, provided that the 
rating assigned to the Securities issued by the Fund is not impaired in any way, the 
payments to be made to the Fund are not adversely affected, and it notifies the Sociedad 
Gestora which, in turn, will notify the Rating Agencies, to: 
(i) 
Allow the subrogation of the Mortgage Loan contracts, solely in the event that the 
characteristics of the new Mortgagor are similar to the characteristics of the previous 
Mortgagor, and that such characteristics conform to the policy set forth in the 
respective Seller’s Internal Memo on Granting of Mortgage Loans. 
(ii) Agree with the Mortgagors to modify the interest rate and final maturity of the 
Mortgage Loans, provided that the terms and conditions set forth in sections 7 and 8 
infra are met. 
7. 
Interest rate modifications 
Pursuant to the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation and this Prospectus, if any 
Seller agrees to modify the interest of any Mortgage Loan that it services and, 
consequently, to modify the corresponding Participation or Certificate, the Fund will still 
be entitled to all the ordinary interest accrued by the Mortgage Loan.  
Each Seller may negotiate a lowering of the interest rate differential applicable to the 
Mortgage Loans underlying the issue of Participations and Certificates, without regard to 
its reference rate, provided that the new weighed average differential of the Participations 
and Certificates it has issued does not imply a reduction or more than 20% in the weighed 
average differential of the Participations and Certificates it has issued, on the Date of 
Incorporation. 
For these purposes, any modifications that lower or raise the interest rate differential 
applicable to the Mortgage Loans will not be construed as novations or renegotiations, if 
such variations are previously agreed upon under the Mortgage Loans notarial deeds.  
8. 
Modifications to final maturity of the loans 
Pursuant to the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation and this Prospectus, each Seller 
may modify the final maturity date of the Mortgage Loans it services and underlying the 
Participations and Certificates they issue, provided that the following conditions are met: 
(i) 
The frequency of the Mortgage Loan principal repayment instalments remains 
unchanged or is reduced, and the repayment system is maintained. 
(ii) The new final maturity date of the loan does not fall after 10 June 2037.

(iii) During the last six months prior to the time that the term is to be modified, all the 
instalments of the Mortgage Loan in question have been paid on time, and the 
Mortgage Loan payments are up-to-date. 
(iv) The Seller and the Mortgagor execute a deed to amend the Mortgage Loan, and the 
deed is filed at the Land Registry, without the mortgage ranking changing to the 
detriment of the Fund’s interests. 
(v) Any expenses incurred in amending the Mortgage Loans are at the expense of the 
respective Seller or Mortgagor, without the Fund being held liable for such expenses 
under any circumstances. 
(vi) The amount of the initial balance of the Participations and Certificates whose period 
of maturity is to be extended, does not exceed 5% of the initial balance of the 
Participations and Certificates of that Seller pooled in the Fund. 
Under no circumstances may the Seller, as administrator of the Mortgage Loans, decide to 
modify the period of maturity of a Mortgage Loan without a request from the Mortgagor. 
The administrator will always considers the Fund’s interests in making any such 
modification. 
The Sociedad Gestora, for and on behalf of the Fund, may cancel or suspend each Seller’s 
permission to modify the period of maturity, at any time throughout the life of the Fund.

(xiv) The Sociedad Gestora will make available to the public any documents and 
information necessary in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation and this

2. 
Resignation and substitution of the Sociedad Gestora. 
The resignation and substitution of the Sociedad Gestora will be governed by Royal 
Decree 926/1998 or the laws in force from time to time. Be that as it may, the Sociedad 
Gestora will be substituted in accordance with the procedure described below, provided 
that such procedure is not in conflict with the regulatory provisions established for such 
purposes:  
1. 
The Sociedad Gestora may resign from such duties whenever it deems such 
resignation appropriate and voluntarily ask to be substituted by submitting a written 
request to the CNMV. The request must enclose a document from the new Sociedad 
Gestora, which must be properly authorized and registered in the Special Registers of the 
CNMV, in which the new Sociedad Gestora states that it is willing to accept such duties 
and seeks appropriate authorization. The resignation of the Sociedad Gestora and the 
appointment of a new company as the Sociedad Gestora of the Fund must be approved by 
the CNMV. Under no circumstances will the Sociedad Gestora resign from its duties until 
all the requirements and formalities have been completed and its substitute can take over 
its duties with respect to the Fund. Furthermore, the Sociedad Gestora will not be entitled 
to resign from its duties if such substitution leads to the downgrading of the rating 
assigned to the Securities by the Rating Agencies. Any expenses incurred in such 
substitution will be for the account of the Sociedad Gestora or, where applicable, of the 
new Sociedad Gestora. 
2. 
The Sociedad Gestora will be substituted in the event of the occurrence, in the 
Sociedad Gestora, of any of the causes for dissolution set forth in article 260, number 1, 
of the Ley de Sociedades Anónimas (Spanish Corporations Act). The Sociedad Gestora 
will report the occurrence of any such cause to the CNMV and the Rating Agencies. In 
this event, the Sociedad Gestora will be bound to comply with the provisions of number 1 
above, before its dissolution. 
3. 
In the event that the Sociedad Gestora is declared bankrupt or its authorization is 
withdrawn, it will proceed to appoint a substitute Sociedad Gestora. The substitution must 
take place within four (4) months of the date on which the event giving rise to such 
substitution occurs. Should the Sociedad Gestora fail to find another Sociedad Gestora 
willing to take over the administration and representation of the Fund or the CNMV 
consider that the proposal is not suitable and may result in the rating of the Securities 
being downgraded, the Fund will be liquidated in advance and the Bonds redeemed, four 
(4) months after the event giving rise to the substitution has occurred. 
4. 
The substitution of the Sociedad Gestora and the appointment of a new Sociedad 
Gestora, approved by the CNMV as stipulated in the preceding paragraphs, must be 
accepted by the Rating Agencies, and published in the AIAF Fixed Income Market Daily 
Bulletin. The Sociedad Gestora undertakes to grant any necessary private and public 
documents for its substitution by another Sociedad Gestora, pursuant to the provisions of 
the previous paragraphs. The substitute sociedad gestora must be subrogated to the rights 
and obligations of the Sociedad Gestora relating to this Prospectus and the Articles of 
Incorporation. Furthermore, the Sociedad Gestora will hand over to the new Sociedad 
Gestora any accounting or computer documents and records relating to the Fund in its 
possession.
