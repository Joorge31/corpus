The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any state of 
the United States or other relevant jurisdiction. The Notes may not at any time be offered, sold or delivered 
within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, any person who is a U.S. Person (as defined in 
Regulation S under the Securities Act (as amended, “Regulation S”)) by any person referred to in Rule 
903(b)(2)(iii) of Regulation S, (x) as part of their distribution at any time or (y) otherwise until 40 calendar days 
after the completion of the distribution of the Notes as determined and certified by the Lead Manager, in either 
case except in accordance with Regulation S. 
EXCEPT WITH THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF THE SELLER (A U.S. RISK RETENTION 
CONSENT) AND WHERE SUCH SALE FALLS WITHIN THE EXEMPTION PROVIDED BY 
SECTION 20 OF THE FINAL RULES PROMULGATED UNDER SECTION 15G OF THE 
SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 (AS AMENDED, THE “U.S. RISK RETENTION RULES”), 
THE NOTES OFFERED AND SOLD BY THE ISSUER MAY NOT BE PURCHASED BY, OR FOR 
THE ACCOUNT OR BENEFIT OF, ANY “U.S. PERSON” AS DEFINED IN THE U.S. RISK 
RETENTION RULES (“RISK RETENTION U.S. PERSONS”). PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS SHOULD 
NOTE THAT THE DEFINITION OF “U.S. PERSON” IN THE U.S. RISK RETENTION RULES IS 
SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO, BUT NOT IDENTICAL TO, THE DEFINITION OF “U.S. PERSON” 
IN REGULATION S. EACH PURCHASER OF THE NOTES, OR A BENEFICIAL INTEREST 
THEREIN, ACQUIRED IN THE INITIAL SYNDICATION OF THE NOTES BY ITS ACQUISITION 
OF THE NOTES, OR A BENEFICIAL INTEREST THEREIN, WILL BE DEEMED TO HAVE MADE

PROSPECTUS OR OTHER OFFERING MATERIALS RELATING TO THE NOTES) TO THE 
ISSUER, THE ORIGINATOR, THE ARRANGER, THE MANAGEMENT COMPANY AND THE

OR BENEFICIAL INTEREST THEREIN, AS PART OF A SCHEME TO EVADE THE 
REQUIREMENTS OF THE U.S. RISK RETENTION RULES (INCLUDING ACQUIRING SUCH 
NOTE OR CERTIFICATE THROUGH A NON-RISK RETENTION U.S. PERSON, RATHER THAN A 
RISK RETENTION U.S. PERSON, AS PART OF A SCHEME TO EVADE THE 10 PER CENT. RISK 
RETENTION U.S. PERSON LIMITATION IN THE EXEMPTION PROVIDED FOR IN SECTION 20 
OF THE U.S. RISK RETENTION RULES). 
IN ORDER TO BE ELIGIBLE TO READ THE PROSPECTUS OR MAKE AN INVESTMENT 
DECISION WITH RESPECT TO THE NOTES DESCRIBED THEREIN, YOU MUST NOT BE A “U.S. 
PERSON” AS DEFINED IN REGULATION S (A “U.S. PERSON”). 
The transaction will not involve the retention by the Seller of at least 5 per cent. of the credit risk of the Issuer for 
the purposes of the U.S. Risk Retention Rules. The Seller intends to rely on the exemption provided for in 
Section 20 of the U.S. Risk Retention Rules regarding non-U.S. transactions that meet certain requirements. No 
other steps have been taken by the Issuer, the Originator, the Management Company, the Arranger or the Lead 
Manager or any of their affiliates or any other party to otherwise comply with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules. See 
“US Risk Retention” in section 3.4.3.2 in the Additional Information below.

IMPORTANT NOTICE: MIFID II PRODUCT GOVERNANCE PROFESSIONAL INVESTORS AND 
ECPS ONLY TARGET MARKET 
 
Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect

professional clients only, each as defined in MIFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to 
eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or 
recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market 
assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market 
assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) 
and determining appropriate distribution channels. 
 
 
IMPORTANT NOTICE: UK MIFIR PRODUCT GOVERNANCE PROFESSIONAL INVESTORS AND 
ECPS ONLY TARGET MARKET 
 
Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect 
of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only eligible counterparties, as 
defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“COBS”), and professional clients, as defined 


 
 
6 
 
in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of the domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (as amended, “UK 
MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are 
appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take 
into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA 
Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product Governance 
Rules”) is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either 
adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution 
channels. 
IMPORTANT NOTICE – UK AFFECTED INVESTORS 
 
From 1 January 2021, relevant UK-established or UK-regulated persons are subject to Regulation (EU) 
2017/2402 as it forms part of the domestic law by virtue of the EUWA, and as amended by the Securitisation 
(Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (the “Securitisation EU Exit Regulations”) (and as may be further 
amended, the “UK Securitisation Regulation”). Article 5 of the UK Securitisation Regulation places certain 
conditions on investments in a “securitisation” (as defined in the UK Securitisation Regulation) (the “UK Due 
Diligence Requirements”) by an “institutional investor” (as defined in the UK Securitisation Regulation). The 
UK Due Diligence Requirements also apply to investments by certain consolidated affiliates, wherever 
established or located, of such institutional investors which are CRR firms (as defined by Article 4(1)(2A) of 
Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA) (such affiliates, 
together with all such institutional investors, “UK Affected Investors”). The UK Securitisation Regulation 
regime is currently subject to a review, which is likely to result in further changes being introduced in the UK in 
due course. Therefore, some divergence between EU and UK regimes exists already and the risk of more 
divergence in the future between EU and UK regimes cannot be ruled out. 
Neither the Seller nor any other party to the transaction described in this Prospectus will retain or commit to 
retain a 5% material net economic interest with respect to this transaction in accordance with the UK 
Securitisation Regulation or makes or intends to make any representation or agreement that it or any other party 
is undertaking or will undertake to take or refrain from taking any action to facilitate or enable the compliance by 
UK Affected Investors with the UK Due Diligence Requirements, or to comply with the requirements of any 
other law or regulation now or hereafter in effect in the UK in relation to risk retention, due diligence and 
monitoring, credit granting standards or any other conditions with respect to investments in securitisation 
transactions by UK Affected Investors. The arrangements described in section 3.4.3 and section 4.2 of the 
Additional Information to be included with respect to Asset-backed Securities and elsewhere in this Prospectus 
have not been structured with the objective of ensuring compliance with the requirements of the UK 
Securitisation Regulation by any person. 
Failure by a UK Affected Investor to comply with the UK Due Diligence Requirements with respect to an 
investment in the Notes offered by this Prospectus may result in regulatory sanctions being imposed by the 
competent authority of such UK Affected Investor (including the imposition of a higher regulatory capital 
charges on that investment). 
The UK Securitisation Regulation also includes criteria and procedures in relation to the designation of 
securitisations as simple, transparent and standardised, or STS, within the meaning of article 18(1) of the UK 
Securitisation Regulation (“UK STS”). The transaction described in this Prospectus is not intended to be 
designated as a UK STS securitisation for the purposes of the UK Securitisation Regulation. Pursuant to article 
18(3) of the UK Securitisation Regulation as amended by the Securitisation EU Exit Regulations, a securitisation 
which meets the requirements for an STS-Securitisation for the purposes of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 of the 
European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2017 laying down a general framework for 
securitisation and creating a specific framework for simple, transparent and standardized securitisation, and 
amending Directives 2009/65/EC, 2009/138/EC and 2011/61/EU and Regulations (EC) No 1060/2009 and (EU) 
No 648/2012, (as amended, the “EU Securitisation Regulation”), which is notified to the European Securities 
and Markets Authority (“ESMA”) in accordance with the applicable requirements before the expiry of the period 
of two years specified in article 18(3) of the Securitisation EU Exit Regulations, as amended, and which is 
included in the ESMA List may be deemed to satisfy the “STS” requirements for the purposes of the UK 


 
 
7 
 
Securitisation Regulation. No assurance can be provided that this transaction does or will continue to meet the 
STS requirements or to qualify as an STS-Securitisation under the EU Securitisation Regulation or pursuant to 
Article 18(3) of the UK Securitisation EU Exit Regulations at any point in time. 
Prospective UK Affected Investors are themselves responsible for analysing their own regulatory position and 
should consult their own advisers in this respect and should consider (and where appropriate, take independent 
advice on) the application of the UK Securitisation Regulation or other applicable regulations and the suitability 
of the Notes for investment.
