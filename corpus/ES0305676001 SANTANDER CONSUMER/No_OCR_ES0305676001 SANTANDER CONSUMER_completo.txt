The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any state of 
the United States or other relevant jurisdiction. The Notes may not at any time be offered, sold or delivered 
within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, any person who is a U.S. Person (as defined in 
Regulation S under the Securities Act (as amended, “Regulation S”)) by any person referred to in Rule 
903(b)(2)(iii) of Regulation S, (x) as part of their distribution at any time or (y) otherwise until 40 calendar days 
after the completion of the distribution of the Notes as determined and certified by the Lead Manager, in either 
case except in accordance with Regulation S. 
EXCEPT WITH THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF THE SELLER (A U.S. RISK RETENTION 
CONSENT) AND WHERE SUCH SALE FALLS WITHIN THE EXEMPTION PROVIDED BY 
SECTION 20 OF THE FINAL RULES PROMULGATED UNDER SECTION 15G OF THE 
SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 (AS AMENDED, THE “U.S. RISK RETENTION RULES”), 
THE NOTES OFFERED AND SOLD BY THE ISSUER MAY NOT BE PURCHASED BY, OR FOR 
THE ACCOUNT OR BENEFIT OF, ANY “U.S. PERSON” AS DEFINED IN THE U.S. RISK 
RETENTION RULES (“RISK RETENTION U.S. PERSONS”). PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS SHOULD 
NOTE THAT THE DEFINITION OF “U.S. PERSON” IN THE U.S. RISK RETENTION RULES IS 
SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO, BUT NOT IDENTICAL TO, THE DEFINITION OF “U.S. PERSON” 
IN REGULATION S. EACH PURCHASER OF THE NOTES, OR A BENEFICIAL INTEREST 
THEREIN, ACQUIRED IN THE INITIAL SYNDICATION OF THE NOTES BY ITS ACQUISITION 
OF THE NOTES, OR A BENEFICIAL INTEREST THEREIN, WILL BE DEEMED TO HAVE MADE

ISSUER, THE ORIGINATOR, THE ARRANGER, THE MANAGEMENT COMPANY AND THE

OR BENEFICIAL INTEREST THEREIN, AS PART OF A SCHEME TO EVADE THE 
REQUIREMENTS OF THE U.S. RISK RETENTION RULES (INCLUDING ACQUIRING SUCH 
NOTE OR CERTIFICATE THROUGH A NON-RISK RETENTION U.S. PERSON, RATHER THAN A 
RISK RETENTION U.S. PERSON, AS PART OF A SCHEME TO EVADE THE 10 PER CENT. RISK 
RETENTION U.S. PERSON LIMITATION IN THE EXEMPTION PROVIDED FOR IN SECTION 20 
OF THE U.S. RISK RETENTION RULES). 
IN ORDER TO BE ELIGIBLE TO READ THE PROSPECTUS OR MAKE AN INVESTMENT 
DECISION WITH RESPECT TO THE NOTES DESCRIBED THEREIN, YOU MUST NOT BE A “U.S. 
PERSON” AS DEFINED IN REGULATION S (A “U.S. PERSON”). 
The transaction will not involve the retention by the Seller of at least 5 per cent. of the credit risk of the Issuer for 
the purposes of the U.S. Risk Retention Rules. The Seller intends to rely on the exemption provided for in

other steps have been taken by the Issuer, the Originator, the Management Company, the Arranger or the Lead 
Manager or any of their affiliates or any other party to otherwise comply with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules. See 
“US Risk Retention” in section 3.4.3.2 in the Additional Information below.

ADDITIONAL IMPORTANT NOTICE IN RESPECT OF THE OBLIGATION TO SUPPLEMENT THE 
PROSPECTUS 
THIS PROSPECTUS HAS BEEN ENTERED IN THE REGISTERS OF THE SPANISH SECURITIES 
MARKET COMMISSION ON 10 NOVEMBER 2022. THE PERIOD OF VALIDY OF THIS PROSPECTUS 
IS UP TO (AND INCLUDING) THE ADMISSION TO TRADING OF THE NOTES IN ACCORDANCE 
WITH THE PROSPECTUS REGULATION. 
ACCORDINGLY, FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT IT IS EXPRESSLY STATED THAT THE 
OBLIGATION TO SUPPLEMENT THE PROSPECTUS IN THE EVENT OF SIGNIFICANT NEW 
FACTORS, MATERIAL MISTAKES OR MATERIAL INACCURACIES DOES NOT APPLY AFTER THE 
TIME WHEN TRADING OF THE NOTES BEGINS. 
 
IMPORTANT NOTICE: MIFID II PRODUCT GOVERNANCE PROFESSIONAL INVESTORS AND 
ECPS ONLY TARGET MARKET 
 
Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect 
of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties and 
professional clients only, each as defined in MIFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to 
eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or 
recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market 
assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market 
assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) 
and determining appropriate distribution channels. 
 
 
IMPORTANT NOTICE: UK MIFIR PRODUCT GOVERNANCE PROFESSIONAL INVESTORS AND 
ECPS ONLY TARGET MARKET 
 
Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect 
of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only eligible counterparties, as 
defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“COBS”), and professional clients, as defined 


 
 
6 
 
in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of the domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (as amended, “UK 
MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are 
appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take 
into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA 
Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product Governance 
Rules”) is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either 
adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution 
channels. 
IMPORTANT NOTICE – UK AFFECTED INVESTORS 
 
From 1 January 2021, relevant UK-established or UK-regulated persons are subject to Regulation (EU) 
2017/2402 as it forms part of the domestic law by virtue of the EUWA, and as amended by the Securitisation 
(Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (the “Securitisation EU Exit Regulations”) (and as may be further 
amended, the “UK Securitisation Regulation”). Article 5 of the UK Securitisation Regulation places certain 
conditions on investments in a “securitisation” (as defined in the UK Securitisation Regulation) (the “UK Due 
Diligence Requirements”) by an “institutional investor” (as defined in the UK Securitisation Regulation). The 
UK Due Diligence Requirements also apply to investments by certain consolidated affiliates, wherever 
established or located, of such institutional investors which are CRR firms (as defined by Article 4(1)(2A) of 
Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA) (such affiliates, 
together with all such institutional investors, “UK Affected Investors”). The UK Securitisation Regulation 
regime is currently subject to a review, which is likely to result in further changes being introduced in the UK in 
due course. Therefore, some divergence between EU and UK regimes exists already and the risk of more 
divergence in the future between EU and UK regimes cannot be ruled out. 
Neither the Seller nor any other party to the transaction described in this Prospectus will retain or commit to 
retain a 5% material net economic interest with respect to this transaction in accordance with the UK 
Securitisation Regulation or makes or intends to make any representation or agreement that it or any other party 
is undertaking or will undertake to take or refrain from taking any action to facilitate or enable the compliance by 
UK Affected Investors with the UK Due Diligence Requirements, or to comply with the requirements of any 
other law or regulation now or hereafter in effect in the UK in relation to risk retention, due diligence and 
monitoring, credit granting standards or any other conditions with respect to investments in securitisation 
transactions by UK Affected Investors. The arrangements described in section 3.4.3 and section 4.2 of the 
Additional Information to be included with respect to Asset-backed Securities and elsewhere in this Prospectus 
have not been structured with the objective of ensuring compliance with the requirements of the UK 
Securitisation Regulation by any person. 
Failure by a UK Affected Investor to comply with the UK Due Diligence Requirements with respect to an 
investment in the Notes offered by this Prospectus may result in regulatory sanctions being imposed by the 
competent authority of such UK Affected Investor (including the imposition of a higher regulatory capital 
charges on that investment). 
The UK Securitisation Regulation also includes criteria and procedures in relation to the designation of 
securitisations as simple, transparent and standardised, or STS, within the meaning of article 18(1) of the UK 
Securitisation Regulation (“UK STS”). The transaction described in this Prospectus is not intended to be 
designated as a UK STS securitisation for the purposes of the UK Securitisation Regulation. Pursuant to article 
18(3) of the UK Securitisation Regulation as amended by the Securitisation EU Exit Regulations, a securitisation 
which meets the requirements for an STS-Securitisation for the purposes of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 of the 
European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2017 laying down a general framework for 
securitisation and creating a specific framework for simple, transparent and standardized securitisation, and 
amending Directives 2009/65/EC, 2009/138/EC and 2011/61/EU and Regulations (EC) No 1060/2009 and (EU) 
No 648/2012, (as amended, the “EU Securitisation Regulation”), which is notified to the European Securities 
and Markets Authority (“ESMA”) in accordance with the applicable requirements before the expiry of the period 
of two years specified in article 18(3) of the Securitisation EU Exit Regulations, as amended, and which is 
included in the ESMA List may be deemed to satisfy the “STS” requirements for the purposes of the UK 


 
 
7 
 
Securitisation Regulation. No assurance can be provided that this transaction does or will continue to meet the 
STS requirements or to qualify as an STS-Securitisation under the EU Securitisation Regulation or pursuant to 
Article 18(3) of the UK Securitisation EU Exit Regulations at any point in time. 
Prospective UK Affected Investors are themselves responsible for analysing their own regulatory position and 
should consult their own advisers in this respect and should consider (and where appropriate, take independent 
advice on) the application of the UK Securitisation Regulation or other applicable regulations and the suitability 
of the Notes for investment.

RISK FACTORS 
THE CONTENTS OF THE RISK FACTORS RELATED TO THE UNDERLYING ASSETS, THE 
NATURE OF THE SECURITIES AND THE NATURE OF THE ISSUER INCLUDED IN “RISK 
FACTORS” SECTION OF THIS PROSPECTUS HAVE BEEN DRAFTED IN ACCORDANCE 
WITH THE ARTICLE 16 OF THE PROSPECTUS REGULATION. THEREFORE, GENERIC 
RISKS REGARDING THE UNDERLYING ASSETS, THE NATURE OF THE SECURITIES AND 
THE NATURE OF THE ISSUER HAVE NOT BEEN INCLUDED IN THIS PROSPECTUS IN 
ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH ARTICLE 16. YOU ARE EXPECTED TO CONDUCT YOUR OWN 
ASSESSMENT AND INQUIRY OF THE GENERIC RISKS DERIVED FROM THE UNDERLYING 
ASSETS, THE NATURE OF THE SECURITIES AND THE NATURE OF THE ISSUER. 
1. 
RISKS SPECIFIC TO THE SECURITIES 
1.1. 
Related to the underlying assets 
1.1.1. 
Risk of payment default of the Borrowers 
Noteholders and other creditors of the Fund shall bear the risk of payment default by the 
Borrowers of the Loans pooled in the Fund. In particular, in the event that the losses under the 
Receivables pooled in the Aggregate Portfolio were higher than the credit enhancements described 
in the Additional Information, this circumstance could potentially negatively affect the payment of 
principal and/or interest under the Notes and/or the Subordinated Loan Agreement. 
The Seller shall accept no liability whatsoever for the Borrower's default of principal, interest or 
any other amount they may owe under the Loans. Pursuant to article 348 of the Spanish 
Commercial Code published by virtue of the Royal Decree of 22 August 1885 (Real Decreto de 22 
de agosto de 1885 por el que se publica el Código de Comercio) (the “Commercial Code”) and 
article 1,529 of the Spanish Civil Code, approved by Royal Decree of 24 July 1889 (Real Decreto 
de 24 de julio de 1889 por el que se publica el Código Civil) (the “Civil Code”), the Seller will 
only be liable vis à vis the Fund for the existence and lawfulness of the Receivables, on the terms 
and conditions set forth in this Prospectus and the Transaction Documents, as well as for the legal 
status under which the transfer is effected. The Seller will have no responsibility nor warrants the 
successful outcome of the transaction and no guarantees will be granted by any public or private 
entity, including the Seller, the Management Company and any of their affiliate companies or 
investee companies; the Seller does not undertake to repurchase the Receivables except for the 
repurchase obligation foreseen in section 2.2.9 of the Additional Information. 
The tables with historical information of delinquency, defaults and recovery rates of SCF auto loan 
portfolio are displayed at the end of section 2.2.7.5 of the Additional Information. The estimated 
cash flows displayed in section 4.10 of the Securities Notes have been calculated with an annual 
constant default rate (“CDR”) of 1.4% and a recovery rate of 59.39% at twenty-four (24) months 
that are consistent with the rates of SCF portfolio of equivalent auto loans and with the 
delinquency data in the charts included below at the end of this section and in section 2.2.7.5 of the 
Additional Information. For the purposes of this Prospectus, such portfolio takes into account the 
relevant proportion of New Vehicles and Used Vehicles and is selected by equivalent loans that 
comply with the following criteria: (i) each and every Loan has a maximum Regulatory PD (as 
defined below in this section) of 6%, and (ii) no Loan is derived from a Refinancing or 
Restructuring. The aforementioned CDR corresponds to a net cumulative loss rate at maturity of 
1.71% in the 6.5% constant prepayment rate (“CPR”) scenario. Please note that the way the CDR 
is calculated differs from the way the weighted average Regulatory PD is calculated and hence the 


 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Risk Factors 
 
 
14 
 
different respective values. The CDR is annualised from the lifetime expected default rate that is 
derived from the Static Cumulative Gross Defaults included in section 2.2.7.5 of the Additional 
Information, while the weighted average Regulatory PD is calculated with internal data, with an 
estimation period from 2006 to the present, as it has to cover a complete economic cycle 
(“through-the-cycle”, TTC). 
The charts below show data corresponding to the evolution of arrears in payments in the auto loan 
portfolio managed by the Seller, excluding (i) Refinancing or Restructuring transactions, or (ii) 
“demo” vehicles and rent-a-car transaction. 
The situation of payments in arrears by number of days and in percentage terms as at 31 May 2022 
was as follows: 
Payment 
Arrears

Up to 30 
days 
Between 31 and

2.42% 
1.11% 
0.63% 
2.76% 
 
For clarification purposes, the information detailed in the table above (regarding payments arrears 
by the Borrowers) reflects the length of the payment delays on the whole auto loan portfolio 
managed by the Seller at the specified date. 
The weighted average Regulatory PD of the Receivables is 2.56%. 
General economic conditions and other factors such as losses of subsidies or interest rate rises, 
may have an impact on the ability of Borrowers to meet their repayment obligations under the 
Loans. A deterioration in economic conditions resulting in increased unemployment rates, 
consumer and commercial bankruptcy filings, a decline in the strength of national and local 
economies, inflation and other results that negatively impact household incomes could have an 
adverse effect on the ability of Borrowers to make payments on their Loans and result in losses on 
the Notes. Unemployment, loss of earnings, illness (including any illness arising in connection 
with an epidemic), divorce and other similar factors may also lead to an increase in delinquencies 
and insolvency filings by Borrowers, which may lead to a reduction in payments by such 
Borrowers on their Loans. The Issuer's ability to meet its payment obligations under the Notes 
depend almost entirely on the full and timely payment of the Borrower's payment obligations 
under the Loans. This risk is additionally affected by the macroeconomic instability of the 
financial markets as explained in section 1.1.2 below. 
“Regulatory PD” refers to the probability of a Borrower not being able to meet its payments 
obligations under the Loans over a one (1) year period as stated in article 163 of CRR. Regulatory 
PD is based on a Through-the-Cycle (TTC) approach according to the guidelines on PD 
estimation, LGD estimation and the treatment of defaulted exposures published by EBA. 
Below is shown the accumulated gross loss ratio for those auto loans that present payment arrears 
+90 days past due, in percentage terms for new and used vehicles over the annual generated loans 
up to May 2022.

In light of the scenarios described in section 4.10 of the Securities Note, it is not expected that the 
Notes incur losses given (i) the different subordination between the different Classes of Notes 
(except for the Class F Notes) and (ii) the additional credit enhancement provided by the available 
excess spread in the transaction. 
Notwithstanding this, prospective investors in the Notes should be aware that the Notes may incur 
losses irrespective of the credit enhancement provided by the subordination among different 
Classes of Notes and/or available excess spread in the transaction. 
1.1.2. 
Risk of deterioration of the economic outlook due to the war between Russia and Ukraine 
and COVID-19  
In addition to the significant macroeconomic challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, 
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has caused and may continue to cause a significant disruption, 
instability and volatility in global markets, as well as result in higher inflation (including by 
contributing to further increases in the prices of energy, oil and other commodities and further 
disrupting supply chains) and lower or negative growth rates. The European Union and other 
governments have imposed significant sanctions and export controls against Russia and 
Russian interests and threatened to impose additional sanctions and controls. The impact of 
these measures, as well as potential responses to them by Russia, is currently unknown, 
although they could significantly affect the stability and growth rates of globlal economies. 
This conflict, together with the growing geopolitical tensions may lead, among others, to a 
deglobalization of the world economy, an increase in protectionism or barriers to immigration, 
a general reduction of international trade in goods and services and a reduction in the

integration of financial markets, any of which could materially and adversely affect the 
financial conditions of the Spanish economy, trigger a rise in the Spanish unemployment rate, 
and therefore have a negative impact on the Receivables and the Obligor’s creditworthiness 
that may result in negative effects on the Issuer’s business, financial condition, results of 
operations and prospects.  
Moreover, according to the ECB report (“ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro 
area – September 2022”), the economic consequences of the war in Ukraine continue to 
unfold and darken the outlook for the euro area economy while pushing up inflationary 
pressures further. Disruptions to natural gas supplies coupled with skyrocketing gas and 
electricity prices have increased uncertainty, severely hit confidence and led to increasing 
losses in real income that are expected to lead to a stagnation of the euro area economy in the 
second half of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023. The uncertainty surrounding both the short 
and the medium-term outlook remains at high levels. According to the ECB, the real Gross 
Domestic Product (“GDP”) growth would be 3.1%, 0.9% and 1.9% in 2022, 2023 and 2024 
respectively, while the HICP inflation (Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices) rates would be 
8.1%, 5.5% and 2.3% in 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively. 
Furthermore, according to ECB’s Economic Bulletin Issue 5, 2022, the recent increase in 
energy prices constitutes a significant supply shock, which could therefore also have an 
impact on the potential output of the euro area economy. Based on the assumptions used in the 
June 2022 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, oil prices in US dollars in the period 
2022 to 2024 are expected to be around 40% higher than their levels in the pre-COVID period 
(2017-2019). It also states that despite one of the main objectives of the discretionary fiscal 
measures adopted by euro area governments is cushioning the impact of energy price 
increases, the risks to the inflation outlook continue to be on the upside and have intensified, 
particularly in the short term. The risks to the medium-term inflation outlook include a 
durable worsening of the production capacity of the economy, persistently high energy and 
food prices, inflation expectations rising above the Governing Council’s target and higher 
than anticipated wage rises.  
In relation specifically to the Spanish economy, according to the Bank of Spain in their article 
“Quarterly Report on the Spanish Economy. Economic Bulletin 3/2022 – Macroeconomic 
Projections for the Spanish Economy (2022-2024) – September 2022”, economic growth 
depends crucially on the developments of the war in Ukraine as the European economy is 
particularly exposed due to its geographical proximity. Several factors will decrease the 
growth outlook for economic activity in the coming quarters, such as the persistence of 
inflation and the maintenance of a high degree of uncertainty, all of which are strongly 
influenced by the consequences of the current energy crisis and the war in Ukraine, and by the 
current economic crisis. In this context, it is expected that the Spanish GDP increases by 
4.5%, 1.4% and 2.9% in 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively, and average inflation in 2022 is 
expected to reach 8.7%, gradually moderating to 5.6% and 1.9% in 2023 and 2024, 
respectively. 
Regarding the inflation rate, in a recent press release published by INE (Instituto Nacional de 
Estadística) on 14 October 2022, the estimated annual inflation of the Consumer Price Index 
(CPI) in September 2022 is 7.3%. In this context, higher consumer prices highlights, while 
fuel and electricity prices reduce from the previous month. The annual variation rate of 
underlying inflation (general index excluding unprocessed food and energy products) stands to 
6.2%.

On 27 October 2022 the Governing Council of the ECB decided to raise the three key ECB 
interest rates by 75 basis points. Accordingly, the interest rate on the main refinancing 
operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility were 
increased to 2.00%, 2.25% and 1.50% respectively, with effect from 2 November 2022. This 
is the third major policy rate increase in a row, by means of which the Governing Council 
intends to progress in withdrawing monetary policy accommodation. The Governing Council 
took this decision, and expects to raise interest rates further, to ensure the timely return of 
inflation to its 2% medium-term inflation target.  
Moreover, although the effects of the crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic have been 
mitigated in recent months by the liberalisation of mobility, new variations are still emerging 
and affecting the global economy. Whilst as of the date of this Prospectus no Covid-19 
Moratoriums have been granted or requested in respect of the Loans at the time of their 
assignment to the Fund, it cannot be discarded that further extensions or new Covid-19 
Moratoriums or Moratoriums in general are approved after the Date of Incorporation of the 
Fund. If that is the case, the Borrowers (and eventually their guarantors) could request such 
extended or new Covid-19 Moratoriums or in general Moratoriums. This could entail a 
temporary reduction and/or postponement of cash flows under the Loans and, ultimately, the 
Available Funds to pay the amounts due under the Notes, and consequently a decrease in the 
average yield and an increase in the duration and final maturity of the Notes. This risk will be 
borne by the Fund and, consequently, the Noteholders, since, in accordance with sections 
2.2.9 and 3.7.1.7 of the Additional Information, the Seller will neither replace nor repurchase 
such Receivables affected after the effective date of their assignment to the Fund by any 
further extensions or new Covid-19 Moratoriums or in general any Moratoriums. 
Whilst as of the date of this Prospectus it is not possible to foresee the full impact of the 
above factors in the global, national or local economy, and consequently the effects they may 
have on the Fund and the Notes, the continuation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the continued 
increase in interest rates and the remaining effects of the COVID-19 outbreak may affect in 
particular: (i) the ability of some Borrowers to make full and timely payments of principal 
and/or interests under their Loans (and therefore increase delinquency ratios in relation to the 
Loans); (ii) the ability of the Seller to originate Loans and assign Additional Receivables 
during the Revolving Period or under any other circumstance as required in the Transaction 
Documents; and (iii) third parties ability to perform their obligations under the Transaction 
Documents to which they are a party (including any failure arising from circumstances beyond 
their control). 
1.1.3. 
Risk concentration depending on the depreciation of the value of the Vehicles 
Two circumstances can cause a reduction of the Vehicles’ recovery value: 
(i) 
Distribution of New Vehicles and Used Vehicles. Depreciation. 
28.82% of the Outstanding Balance of the Receivables selected for assignment to the Fund 
corresponds to New Vehicles (i.e., vehicles with an age, since registration, of less than or 
equal to twelve (12) months). The remaining 71.18% corresponds to Used Vehicles, as 
detailed in section 2.2.2.3 (i) of the Additional Information. Information regarding the 
Receivables assigned to the Fund that correspond to brand new vehicles that have never 
been used is not available. 
As detailed in section 2.2.2.3(xi) of the Additional Information, the largest concentration 
according to the year of origination of the Receivables selected to be assigned to the Fund 


 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Risk Factors 
 
 
18 
 
are, as a percentage of the Outstanding Balance of the Receivables, as follows: year 2020 
(4.07%), year 2021 (62.46%) and year 2022 (32.84%), altogether representing 99.37%. 
Given the high concentration of loans originated between 2020, 2021 and 2022, it can be 
assumed that their delinquency rate has not yet reached its maximum value, so it is possible 
that in the coming months the delinquency rate of the Receivables may increase. 
The immediate depreciation suffered by a New Vehicle (vehicles with an age, since 
registration, of less than or equal to twelve (12) months) at the time that it leaves the 
corresponding dealer approximately represents 20% of its value, moreover, it is also 
necessary to take into account an average monthly depreciation, which is approximately a 
1.5% (monthly) additional depreciation of the vehicle value for the first year. The 
cumulative depreciation during the twelve (12) first months since registration can reach 
approximately a 38.00%. Additionally, it is also necessary to take into account a 0.6% 
(monthly) depreciation for the second and third years, a 0.5% (monthly) depreciation for the 
fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh years, and a 0.4% (monthly) depreciation for the subsequent 
years. 
In case of Used Vehicles (vehicles with an age, since registration, of more than twelve (12) 
months), in addition to the cumulative depreciation during the twelve (12) first months 
since registration, it should be added a 0.6% (monthly) depreciation to the market value of 
the vehicle for the second and third years, and a 0.5% (monthly) depreciation for the fourth, 
fifth, sixth and seventh years, and a 0.4% (monthly) depreciation for the subsequent years. 
The weighted average age of the Used Vehicles at the time of granting the Loans is 40 
months (3.3 years). 
(ii) 
Distribution of the Loan over the value of the Vehicle. 
56.63% of the Loans representing the total Outstanding Balance of the Receivables have a 
ratio of the Loan amount granted over the value of the Vehicle of higher than 80%, of 
which 9.14% have a ratio higher than or equal to 100% and less than 110%, and 1.30% 
have a ratio higher than or equal to 110%. This ratio of the Loan amount granted over the 
value of the Vehicle may be adversely affected by the depreciation of the value of New 
Vehicles and Used Vehicles. However, this negative impact is partially reduced by the 
ordinary and anticipated amortisation of the Loans. 
The circumstances described above constitute a risk of impairment of the recovery value in the 
event of enforcement (following a payment default under any Loan Agreement) of the security 
over the Vehicles. If the proceeds received from enforcement were not sufficient to repay in full 
the Receivables arising from the relevant Loan, the resulting loss will cause a reduction of the 
Available Funds to meet the payment obligations of the Fund (including principal and/or interest 
under the Notes). 
1.1.4. 
Loan Agreements partially formalised as public documents 
As set out in section 2.2 of the Additional Information, all Loan Agreements contain reservation of 
title clauses (reserva de dominio) in order to secure the Receivables. 
The inclusion of a reservation of title clause would grant the Seller, as creditor, a right of 
ownership (dominio) over the Vehicle financed under the Loan until such Loan is repaid in full. In 
order for reservation of title clauses to be enforceable vis-à-vis third parties, it will be necessary to 
register them in the Register of Instalment Sales of Movable Properties (Registro de Venta a 
Plazos de Bienes Muebles). 


 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Risk Factors 
 
 
19 
 
Not all reservation of title clauses in the Loan Agreements are registered in the Register of 
Instalment Sales of Movable Properties; only those representing 21.80% of the Outstanding 
Balance of Receivables, as provided in section 2.2.2.3 (vi) (b) of the Additional Information, are 
registered. Therefore, until their registration, the reservation of title clauses may not be enforceable 
against third parties. 
As per section 2.2.7.1 of the Additional Information, pursuant to SCF Policies, the reservation of 
title formalised in a public deed (póliza) or in an official form, shall be immediately registered in 
the Register of Instalment Sales of Movable Properties when any irregularities are detected by the 
Collection Business Unit (“CBU”) and/or when the Operation Decision Unit (“ODU”) analyst 
deems appropriate. And, as a general rule, the reservation of title is also required to be registered in 
the Register of Instalment Sales of Movable Properties when the amount of principal to be 
financed is equal or above €24,000. 
As a general rule and as provided in section 2.2.7.1 of the Additional Information, a public deed 
(póliza) granted before a public notary is generally required when principal amounts are equal or 
above €50,000 (including pre-authorised outstanding risk). 
From the random sample of the Preliminary Portfolio, 1 Loan representing 0.19% of the number of 
Loans included in the random sample of the Preliminary Portfolio (which represents 0.75% of their 
Outstanding Balance) is formalised in a public deed (póliza) granted before a public notary, as 
detailed in section 2.2.2.3 (xvii) of the Additional Information. This piece of information in 
relation to the whole Preliminary Portfolio has not been collected and therefore it is not available. 
Enforceability risk 
Enforceability of reservation of title clauses may be affected in case of non fulfilment of the above 
formalities following execution of the Loan Agreements. 
In particular, non-registration of a reservation of title clause involves that the Loan Agreement 
shall exclusively have inter-partes effects (i.e., it would be unenforceable against third party 
purchasers in good faith, who would be considered as having validly acquired the Vehicle affected 
by the reservation of title clause, without prejudice to Seller’s right to claim damages against the 
Borrower arising from the latter's failure to abide by the non-disposal covenant). 
Issues arising in connection with enforceability of reservation of title clauses (including 
unenforceability against third party purchasers in good faith) may affect the recovery ability of the 
Fund in the event of enforcement (following a payment default under any Loan) of the security 
over the Vehicles and, ultimately, a reduction of the Available Funds to meet the payment 
obligations of the Fund (including principal and/or interest under the Notes). 
Loan Agreement executed in a public deed (póliza) or official form with registration with the 
Register of Instalment Sales of Movable Properties: 
In the event that the Loan Agreement is formalised in an official form or as a public deed (póliza), 
in accordance with sections 4 and 5 of article 517 of the Spanish Civil Procedure Law and 
registered with the Register of Instalment Sales of Movable Properties, the recovery procedure is 
made through a public notary, who may demand payment from the Borrower within three (3) 
working days. After expiry of such term without the Borrower paying the claimed amount or 
handing over possession of the Vehicle, the Fund may file a claim before the competent Court for 
the recovery of the property or foreclose the collateral, pursuant to first additional provision of 


 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Risk Factors 
 
 
20 
 
Law 28/1998. In addition, notarizing the Loan Agreement would permit to initiate an enforcement 
proceeding to attach other assets. 
If the Loan Agreement was formalised (i) in an official form, the Fund may choose to exercise the 
summary verbal procedure to obtain repossession of the Vehicle; or (ii) as a public deed (póliza), 
the Fund may choose to exercise the enforcement action and foreclose on the collateral or attach 
other assets. 
In the event of insolvency of the Borrower, the claim of the Fund will be classified as a secured 
claim with priority over the collateral proceeds and, subject to legal automatic stays and 
exceptions, the Fund may also seek repossession thereof. 
Loan Agreement executed in a public deed (póliza) or official form without registration with the 
Register of Instalment Sales of Movable Properties: 
In the event that the Loan Agreement is formalised as a public deed (póliza) or official form, the 
Fund will be able to start enforcement proceedings to attach the assets of the Borrower. 
Pursuant to the Spanish Supreme Court case law, to the extent that the Loan Agreements are 
executed in a public deed (póliza) these would be classified as secured within an insolvency 
proceeding of the Borrower (even if these are not registered with the Register of Instalment Sales 
of Movable Properties). 
If the Loan Agreements are not executed in public deed (póliza) nor registered with the Register of 
Instalment Sales of Movable Properties such claims would be classified as “ordinary” (unsecured) 
in the event of insolvency of the Borrower, in accordance with article 271.1 of the Insolvency Law, 
and therefore would rank pari passu with the rest of unsecured creditors. In addition, the Fund will 
not be able to seek restitution of possession of the Vehicle. 
Notwithstanding the above, in the event of insolvency of the Borrower, the ranking of credit rights 
will be assigned by the insolvency administrator and creditors will be able to challenge such 
ranking in case of disagreement. 
Other related risks 
The Vehicles financed under the Loans will remain in possession of the Borrowers, who may in 
fact instigate the loss of the Vehicles, without prejudice to the resulting liability that they might 
incur. 
Likewise, although from a legal point of view the protection provided by the registration of the 
reservation of title with the Register of Instalment Sales of Movable Properties is similar to that 
provided by the registration of ownership of real estate with the Land Register, the level of 
protection may in practice be lower due to the movable nature of the assets. 
1.1.5. 
Receivables prepayment risk 
Borrowers may prepay the Outstanding Balance of the Receivables, in the terms set out in the 
relevant Loan Agreement from which the Receivables arise. 
Upon termination of the Revolving Period, this prepayment risk shall pass onto the Noteholders 
quarterly on each Payment Date through the partial redemption of the Notes (to the extent 
applicable in accordance with the provisions of section 4.9.2.1 of the Securities Note). 


 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Risk Factors 
 
 
21 
 
Early repayment of the Receivables in rates higher than expected will cause the Fund to make 
payments of principal on the Notes earlier than expected and will shorten the maturity of the 
Notes. If principal is paid on the Notes earlier than expected due to prepayments on the 
Receivables (such prepayments occurring at a time when interest rates are lower than interest rates 
that would otherwise be applied if such prepayments had not been made or made at a different 
time), Noteholders may not be able to reinvest the principal in a comparable security with an 
effective interest rate equivalent to the interest rate on the Notes. Similarly, if principal payments 
on the Notes are made later than expected due to slower than expected prepayments or payments 
on the Receivables, Noteholders may lose reinvestment opportunities. Noteholders will bear all 
reinvestment risk resulting from receiving payments of principal on the Notes earlier than 
expected. 
1.1.6. 
Interest rate risk and hedging instrument 
The Receivables pooled in the Aggregate Portfolio include and will include interest payments 
calculated at interest rates and periods, which are different from the interest rates and periods 
applicable to the interest due under the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the 
Class D Notes and the Class E Notes (the “Floating Rate Notes”). 
The weighted average coupon of the Floating Rate Notes is 3.20% (assuming an EURIBOR 3 
months rate of 1.732% on 4 November 2022) and the weighted average interest of the Initial 
Receivables is 6.78%, as described in section 2.2.2.3(ix) of the Additional Information. 
The Fund expects to meet its payment obligations under the Floating Rate Notes with the 
collections received from the Receivables. However, the interest component in respect of such 
collections may have no correlation to the floating rate applicable to the Floating Rate Notes from 
time to time. 
To protect the Fund from a situation where EURIBOR increases to such an extent that the 
collections received from the Non-Defaulted Receivables are not sufficient to cover the Fund’s 
obligations under the Floating Rate Notes, the Fund will enter into an interest rate swap transaction 
(the “Interest Rate Swap Transaction”) on the Date of Incorporation with Banco Santander, S.A. 
(the “Swap Counterparty”), which shall at all times be (or its credit support provider shall at all 
times be) an institution rated in accordance with the provisions of the Interest Rate Swap 
Agreement. 
Pursuant to the Interest Rate Swap Agreement, the Fund will pay an amount equal to a fixed 
interest rate set out in section 3.4.8.1.4 of the Additional Information and the Swap Counterparty 
will pay an amount equal to a floating rate of EURIBOR 3 months, in either case by reference to 
the Notional Amount. 
Accordingly, the Fund may in certain circumstances depend upon payments made by the Swap 
Counterparty in order to have sufficient funds available to make payments of interest on the 
Floating Rate Notes. If the Swap Counterparty fails to pay any amounts when due under the 
Interest Rate Swap Transaction, the Available Funds may be insufficient to make the interest 
payments on the Floating Rate Notes and the Noteholders may experience delays and/or reductions 
in the interest payments due to be received by them. 
In the event of early termination of the Interest Rate Swap Transaction, including any termination 
upon failure by the Swap Counterparty to perform its obligations, the Fund will use its best 
endeavours to, but cannot guarantee that it will be able to, find a replacement Swap Counterparty. 


 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Risk Factors 
 
 
22 
 
In such circumstances, there is no assurance that the Fund will be able to meet its payment 
obligations under the Floating Rate Notes in full or even in part. 
As the notional amount of the Interest Rate Swap Transaction with respect to which payments due 
from the Swap Counterparty will be calculated by reference to the Outstanding Balance of the 
Non-Defaulted Receivables, and it does not consider the Outstanding Balance of the Defaulted 
Receivables, the Interest Rate Swap Transaction may not fully mitigate the interest rate risk borne 
by the Fund.  
Additionally, if the Interest Rate Swap Transaction is early terminated, then the Fund may be 
obliged to pay the amount determined pursuant to the Interest Rate Swap Agreement to the Swap 
Counterparty. Except in certain circumstances, any termination payment due to the Swap 
Counterparty by the Fund will rank in priority to payments due on the Notes. Any additional 
amounts required to be paid by the Fund as a result of the termination of the Interest Rate Swap 
Transaction (including any extra costs incurred if the Fund cannot immediately enter into one or 
more, as appropriate, replacement interest rate swap transaction), may also rank in priority to 
payments due on the Notes. Therefore, if the Fund is obliged to pay an amount determined 
pursuant to the Interest Rate Swap Agreement to the Swap Counterparty or to pay any other 
additional amount as a result of the termination of the Interest Rate Swap Transaction, this may 
reduce the Available Funds to meet the payment obligations of the Fund (including principal 
and/or interest under the Notes). For further details, see sections 3.4.7. and 3.4.8.1. of the 
Additional Information. 
1.1.7. 
Geographical concentration risk 
As detailed in section 2.2.2.3(xv) of the Additional Information, the autonomous communities 
having the largest concentrations of Borrowers under the Receivables in the Preliminary Portfolio 
is as follows (as a percentage of the Outstanding Balance of the Receivables): Andalusia 
(Andalucía) (22.54%), Catalonia (Cataluña) (13.06%), Valencian Community (Comunidad 
Valenciana) (11.38%) and Madrid Community (Comunidad de Madrid) (10.39%) and, altogether 
representing 57.37%. 
Any significant event (political, social, pandemics, natural disasters, etc.) occurring in these 
Autonomous Communities could adversely affect the creditworthiness of the relevant Borrowers 
and their capacity to repay the Loans when due. 
1.2. 
Related to the nature of the securities 
1.2.1. 
Current inflation rate, interest rates and their impact on the price and the IRR of the Notes 
As described in section 1.1.2 above, inflation rates, both in Spain and in the rest of the European 
Union, are reaching high levels. The European Central Bank has provided clear forward guidance. 
It has raised the three key ECB interest rates by 75 basis points for the second time in a row, and 
intends to raise interest rates further, and with gradual but sustained increases thereafter. In recent 
months, as result of the significant increase in inflation rates, this has also translated into a rise in 
market interest rates at the various maturities and with a very high degree of volatility.  
According to the Macroeconomic forecast report of Bank of Spain (“Quarterly Report on the 
Spanish Economy. Economic Bulletin 3/2022 – Macroeconomic Projections for the Spanish 
Economy (2022-2024) – September 2022”), EURIBOR and longer-term interest rates are expected 
to increase in 2022 if compared to those rates in 2021 and these rates will continue to increase in 
2023 and 2024.

The Floating Rate Notes issued by the Issuer are floating rate note instruments that pay a periodic 
(quarterly) coupon comprising a variable reference rate (EURIBOR 3 months) plus a constant 
spread. Given the quarterly reset frequency of the Notes, the impact in price in the event of a rise 
in interest rates is lower than that of similar fixed rate securities or floating rate note instruments 
with a lower reset frequency. In fact, the major impact on the price of the Notes is mainly caused 
by the relationship between the quoted spread of the Notes and the discount margin (i.e, the yield 
spread versus the reference rate such that the floating rate note is priced at par on a rate reset date). 
Therefore, when the discount margin is higher that the quoted spread of the Notes, the price of the 
Floating Rate Notes will be at discount.  
Additionally, considering the abovementioned variables (inflation rate, interest rates, etc.), among 
others, the internal rate of return (IRR) of the Notes may differ from those detailed in section 4.10 
of the Securities Note of this Prospectus. 
1.2.2. 
Subordination risk 
As set out in section 4.6.3.1 of the Securities Note, during the Revolving Period and the Pro-Rata 
Redemption Period, the ordinary redemption of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C 
Notes, the Class D Notes and the Class E Notes will be pari passu and pro-rata without preference 
or priority amongst themselves in accordance with the Pre-Enforcement Priority of Payments set 
forth in section 3.4.7 of the Additional Information. 
In addition, during the period starting from (and including) the Payment Date immediately 
following the occurrence of a Subordination Event, and ending on (an including) the earlier of (i) 
the Legal Maturity Date; (ii) the Payment Date on which the Floating Rate Notes will be redeemed 
in full; or (iii) the Early Liquidation Date (i.e. during the Sequential Redemption Period), the Class 
A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes and the Class E Notes will be 
redeemed sequentially in accordance with the Pre-Enforcement Priority of Payments set forth in 
section 3.4.7 of the Additional Information. Therefore, during the Sequential Redemption Period, 
the payment of interest and the reimbursement of principal for the Class B Notes are subordinated 
to those for the Class A Notes; the payment of interest and the reimbursement of principal for the 
Class C Notes are subordinated to those for the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes; the payment 
of interest and the reimbursement of principal for the Class D Notes are subordinated to those for 
the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes and the Class C Notes; and the payment of interest and the 
reimbursement of principal for the Class E Notes are subordinated to those for the Class A Notes, 
the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes and the Class D Notes. 
Conversely, the Class F Notes shall be redeemed during the Pro-rata Redemption Period and 
the Sequential Redemption Period with the available excess spread for an amount equal to 
Class F Notes Target Amortisation Amount in accordance with the Pre-Enforcement Priority of 
Payments set forth in section 3.4.7 of the Additional Information. 
As a result, during the Sequential Redemption Period: 
– 
Class A Notes: will rank pari passu and pro rata without preference or priority 
amongst themselves and in priority to the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class 
D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes and shall benefit from 19.09% of 
subordination of the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E 
Notes and the Class F Notes, as the case may be. 
 


 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Risk Factors 
 
 
24 
 
– 
Class B Notes: will rank pari passu and pro rata without preference or priority 
amongst themselves and in priority to the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E 
Notes and the Class F Notes, and shall benefit from 14.50% of subordination of the 
Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes, as the case 
may be. 
 
– 
Class C Notes: will rank pari passu and pro rata without preference or priority 
amongst themselves and in priority to the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the 
Class F Notes, and shall benefit from 11.32% of subordination of the Class D Notes, 
the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes, as the case may be. 
 
– 
Class D Notes: will rank pari passu and pro rata without preference or priority 
amongst themselves and in priority to the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes, and 
shall benefit from 4.95% of subordination of the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes, 
as the case may be. 
 
– 
Class E Notes: will rank pari passu and pro rata without preference or priority 
amongst themselves and in priority to the Class F Notes, and shall benefit from 0.99% 
of subordination of the Class F Notes, as the case may be. 
 
– 
Class F Notes: will rank pari passu and pro rata without preference or priority 
amongst themselves and its payment of interest and the repayment of principal are 
subordinated to those of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the 
Class D Notes and the Class E Notes. Notwithstanding, the Class F Notes will amortise 
with the available excess spread for an amount equal to the Class F Notes Target 
Amortisation Amount, until the Class F Notes are fully redeemed. Once the Class F 
Notes are fully redeemed the subordination of such Class F Notes will no longer apply. 
 
Based on the assumptions presented in section 4.10 of the Securities Notes, under the 6.5% CPR 
scenario: 
(i) 
the Floating Rate Notes shall redeem from the Payment Date falling on March 2024 to the 
Payment Date falling on September 2028; and 
(ii) 
the Class F Notes shall start to redeem from the Payment Date falling on December 2022. 
There is no certainty that these subordination rules shall protect any Class of Notes from the risk of 
loss. The materiality of this risk is further developed in section 3.4.7 of the Additional Information. 
1.2.3. 
Notes Euroeligibility risk 
The Class A Notes are intended to be held in a manner which will allow be recognised as eligible 
collateral for Eurosystem monetary policy and Intraday credit operations by the Eurosystem 
(“Eurosystem Eligible Collateral”). This means that the Class A Notes are intended upon issue to 
be deposited with Sociedad de Gestion de los Sistemas de Registro, Compensación y Liquidacion 
de Valores S.A.U. (“IBERCLEAR”) but does not necessarily mean that the Class A Notes shall be 
recognised as Eurosystem Eligible Collateral either upon issue or at any or all times during their 
life. Such recognition will, inter alia, depend upon satisfaction of the Eurosystem eligibility criteria 
set out in the Guideline of the European Central Bank (the “ECB”) of 19 December 2014 on the 
implementation of the Eurosystem monetary policy framework (ECB/2014/60) (recast) as 
amended and applicable from time to time (the “Guideline”), including compliance with loan-by-


 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Risk Factors 
 
 
25 
 
loan reporting in a prescribed format and manner. It should be noted that, with effect from 1 
October 2021 (but subject to certain transitional provisions), amended Eurosystem rules apply to 
loan-by-loan reporting whereby loan-level reporting via an ESMA-authorised securitisation 
repository in compliance with article 7 of the EU Securitisation Regulation applies. 
If the Class A Notes do not satisfy the criteria specified by the ECB, or if the Servicer fails to 
submit the required loan-level data, the Class A Notes will not be eligible collateral for the 
Eurosystem. 
None of the Fund, the Management Company, the Seller, the Lead Manager or the Arranger gives 
any representation, warranty, confirmation or guarantee to any investor or potential investor in the 
Class A Notes that the Class A Notes will, either upon issue, or at any time or at all times during 
their life, satisfy all or any requirements for Eurosystem eligibility and be recognised as 
Eurosystem Eligible Collateral for any reason whatever. Any potential investor in the Class A 
Notes should make its own conclusions and seek its own advice with respect to whether or not the 
Class A Notes constitute Eurosystem Eligible Collateral. 
1.2.4. 
Yield and duration risk 
Several calculations, such as the average yield, duration and final maturity of the Notes in each 
Class (assuming a CPR of 5.0%, 6.5% and 8.0% -which is consistent with the historical 
information provided by the Seller-) contained in section 4.10 of the Securities Note are subject to 
a number of hypotheses, inter alia, estimates of prepayment rates and delinquency rates that may 
not be fulfilled. 
These calculations are influenced by a number of economic and social factors such as the COVID-
19 pandemic, macroeconomic instability caused by the Ukraine conflict, market interest rates, the 
Borrowers' financial circumstances and the general level of economic activity, preventing their 
predictability. Please refer to section 1.1.2 of the Risk Factors for further information regarding the 
risk of deterioration of the economic outlook due to COVID-19 and the war between Russia and 
Ukraine. 
No guarantee can be given as to the level of prepayments (in part or in full) that the Receivables 
may experience. Early repayment of the Receivables in rates higher than expected will cause the 
Issuer to make payments of principal on the Notes earlier than expected and will shorten the 
maturity of such Notes. 
1.2.5. 
Early redemption of the Notes 
(i) 
Occurrence of a Clean-Up Call Event or Tax Call Event 
In accordance with section 4.4.3.2 of the Registration Document, the Seller will have the right (but 
not the obligation) to instruct the Management Company to carry out the Early Liquidation of the 
Fund and an Early Redemption of the Notes in whole (but not in part) and hence repurchase at its 
own discretion all outstanding Receivables in any of the following instances: 
(a) 
upon the occurrence of a Clean-Up Call Event, or 
(b) 
upon the occurrence of a Tax Call Event. 
For these purposes: 


 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Risk Factors 
 
 
26 
 
- 
“Clean-Up Call Event” means the event by virtue of which the Seller has the right (but not 
the obligation), only to the extent that there are sufficient funds to repay back the Floating 
Rate Notes in full, to instruct the Management Company to carry out an Early Liquidation 
of the Fund and an Early Redemption of all Notes and hence repurchase at its own 
discretion all outstanding Receivables, when the aggregate Outstanding Balance of the 
Receivables falls below 10% of the Outstanding Balance of the Receivables on the Date of 
Incorporation. 
- 
“Tax Call Event” means the event, derived from changes in relevant taxation law and 
accounting provisions and/or regulation (or official interpretation of that taxation law and 
accounting provisions and/or regulation by authorities), by virtue of which the Seller has 
the right (but not the obligation) to instruct the Management Company to carry out an Early 
Liquidation of the Fund and an Early Redemption of all Notes and hence repurchase at its 
own discretion all outstanding Receivables, when the Fund is or becomes at any time 
required by law to deduct or withhold, in respect of any payment under any of the Notes, 
any present or future taxes, levies or governmental charges, regardless of their nature, 
which are imposed under any applicable legal system or in any country with competent 
jurisdiction, or for the account of, any political subdivision thereof or government agency 
authorised to levy taxes, that materially affect the allocation of benefits among the parties of 
the Transaction. 
Upon the occurrence of any of those events, the Seller may repurchase all outstanding Receivables 
at the Final Repurchase Price calculated in accordance with section 4.4.3.2 of the Registration 
Document. 
Any potential investor in the Notes should be aware that the occurrence of Tax Call Event may 
result in the Principal Amount Outstanding of the Notes, if any, not being redeemed in full. 
Given the Final Repurchase Price mentioned above, any potential investor in the Class F Notes 
should be aware that the occurrence of Clean-up Call Event may result in the Principal Amount 
Outstanding of the Class F Notes, if any, not being redeemed in full. 
If the Notes are redeemed earlier than expected due to the exercise by the Fund (following 
instructions of the Seller) of the early redemption of such Notes (such early redemption occurring 
at a time when interest rates are lower than interest rates that would otherwise be applied if such 
early redemption had not been made or made at a different time), Noteholders may not be able to 
reinvest the principal in a comparable security with an effective interest rate equivalent to the 
interest rate on the Notes. Noteholders will bear all reinvestment risk resulting from early 
redemption of the Notes earlier than expected. 
That being said, there is no guarantee that, upon the occurrence of a Clean-up Call Event and/or 
Tax Call Event, the Seller shall exercise the Clean-up Call Event and/or Tax Call Event and 
therefore give its written instruction to the Management Company to carry out an Early 
Liquidation of the Fund and an Early Redemption of the Notes. 
(ii) 
Occurrence of a Regulatory Call Event 
Additionally, in accordance with section 4.9.2.3 of the Securities Note, upon the occurrence of a 
Regulatory Call Event the Seller will have the right (but not the obligation) to request the 
Management Company to redeem in full (but not in part) on any Payment Date thereafter the Class 


 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Risk Factors 
 
 
27 
 
B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes (while the 
Class A Notes and the Cash Reserve shall not be affected). 
It should be noted that as a requisite for the exercise of this right by the Seller, the Seller shall 
provide to the Fund through the Seller Loan the necessary funds on such Payment Date to 
discharge the Fund’s outstanding liabilities in respect of all the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, 
the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes in full after making the payments 
ranking in priority to or pari passu therewith, in accordance with the Pre-Enforcement Priority of 
Payments set out in section 3.4.7.2 of the Additional Information. 
In that case, once the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and 
the Class F Notes are redeemed in full, the Class A Notes shall benefit from subordination of the 
Seller Loan (which will be granted by the Seller to repay the Class B, Class C, Class D, Class E 
and Class F Notes) instead of the redeemed subordinated Notes, and from the collateralisation of 
all Receivables which, prior to the exercise by the Seller of the option above, backed all Classes of 
Notes. 
No losses under the Notes shall result from the exercise by the Seller of this option upon the 
occurrence of a Regulatory Call Event. 
For these purposes: 
- 
“Regulatory Call Event” means (i) any enactment or implementation of, or supplement or 
amendment to, or change in any applicable law, policy, rule, guideline or regulation of any 
competent international, European or national body (including the European Central Bank, 
the Prudential Regulation Authority or any other competent international, European or 
national regulatory or supervisory authority) or the application or official interpretation of, 
or view expressed by any such competent body with respect to, any such law, regulation, 
rule, policy or guideline; or (ii) a notification by or other communication from an applicable 
regulatory or supervisory authority is received by the Seller with respect to the transactions 
contemplated by the Transaction Documents, which, in either case, occurs on or after the 
Date of Incorporation and results in, or would in the reasonable opinion of the Seller result 
in, a material adverse change in the rate of return on capital of the Fund and/or the Seller or 
materially increasing the cost or materially reducing the benefit for the Seller of the 
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents. 
1.2.6. 
Risk relating to benchmarks 
The interest payable on the Floating Rate Notes and payments to be made in respect of the Interest 
Rate Swap Transaction are determined by reference to the Euro Interbank Offered Rate 
(“EURIBOR”), a reference rate that constitutes a benchmark for the purpose of Regulation (EU) 
No. 2016/1011 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of Regulation (EU) No. 2016/1011 (as 
amended, the “EU Benchmarks Regulation”). Such benchmark is administered by the European 
Money Markets Institute, included in the European Securities Market Insititute (the “ESMA”) 
register of administrators and benchmarks under Article 36 (Register of administrators and 
benchmarks) of the EU Benchmarks Regulation. The registration status of any administrator under 
the EU Benchmarks Regulation is a matter of public record and, save where required by the 
applicable law, the Fund does not intend to update the applicable terms to reflect any change in the 
registration status of the administrator.

Reference rates and indices such as EURIBOR and other interest rate or other types of rates and 
indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks” (each a “Benchmark” and together, the 
“Benchmarks”), to which interest on securities may be linked, have become the subject of 
regulatory scrutiny and recent national and international regulatory guidance and proposals for 
reforms. This has resulted in regulatory reform and changes to existing Benchmarks. Such reform 
of Benchmarks includes the EU Benchmarks Regulation and Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 which 
apply to the provision of Benchmarks, the contribution of input data to a Benchmark and the use of 
a Benchmark within the EU. Among other things, the EU Benchmarks Regulation (i) require 
Benchmark administrators to be authorised or registered (or, if non-EU-based or UK-based, to be 
subject to an equivalent regime or otherwise recognised or endorsed) and (ii) prevent certain uses 
by EU and UK supervised entities, as applicable, (such as the Issuer) of Benchmarks of 
administrators that are not authorised or registered (or, if non-EU based or UK-based, as 
applicable, not deemed equivalent or recognised or endorsed). 
The Benchmarks Regulations could have a material impact on the Floating Rate Notes and the 
Interest Rate Swap Transaction, in particular, if the methodology or other terms of the Benchmark 
are changed in order to comply with the requirements of the Benchmarks Regulations. Such 
changes could, among other things, have the effect of reducing, increasing or otherwise affecting 
the volatility of the published rate or level of the relevant Benchmark. 
Although EURIBOR has been reformed in order to comply with the terms of the EU Benchmarks 
Regulation, it remains uncertain as to how long it will continue in its current form, or whether it 
will be further reformed or replaced with an alternative benchmark. The euro risk free-rate 
working group for the euro area has also published a set of guiding principles and high level 
recommendations for fall-back provisions in, amongst other things, new euro denominated cash 
products (including bonds) referencing EURIBOR. The guiding principles indicate, among other 
things, that continuing to reference EURIBOR in relevant contracts (without robust fall-back 
provisions) may increase the risk to the euro area financial system. On 11 May 2021, the working 
group on euro risk-free rates as an alternative to the EURIBOR issued recommendations on 
EURIBOR fall-back trigger events and fall-back rates. Investors should be aware that the market is 
continuing to develop such alternative reference rates and further changes or recommendations 
may be introduced. 
It is not possible to predict whether, and to what extent, EURIBOR will continue to be supported 
going forward. This may cause EURIBOR to perform differently than they have done in the past 
and may have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Such factors may have (without 
limitation) the following effects on certain Benchmarks: (i) discouraging market participants from 
continuing to administer or contribute to a Benchmark; (ii) triggering changes in the rules or 
methodologies used in the Benchmark; or (iii) leading to the disappearance of the Benchmark. Any 
of the above changes or any other consequential changes as a result of international or national 
reforms or other initiatives or investigations, could a material adverse effect on the value or 
liquidity of, and return on, any Notes linked to, referencing, or otherwise dependent (in whole or in 
part upon), a Benchmark. 
Investors should consult their own independent advisers and make their own assessment about the 
potential risks imposed by the Benchmarks Regulations reforms in making any investment 
decision with respect to any Notes linked to, referencing, or otherwise dependent (in whole or in 
part upon), a Benchmark. 
Any of the above changes could have a material adverse effect on the value of and return on the 
Floating Rate Notes.

On a separate matter, as provided in section 4.8.4 of the Securities Notes, changes in the manner of 
administration of EURIBOR could result in the base rate changing from EURIBOR to an 
Alternative Base Rate under certain circumstances broadly related to EURIBOR dysfunction or 
discontinuation. This Alternative Base Rate will be determined by the Rate Administration Agent 
and, subject to certain conditions being satisfied, it will be implemented in substitution of 
EURIBOR or the then current Reference Rate, as the new Reference Rate applicable of the 
Floating Rate Notes and other relevant agreements (as applicable), except that Noteholders 
representing at least 10 per cent. of the Outstanding Principal Balance of the Most Senior Class of 
Floating Rate Notes do not consent to the Base Rate Modification. Such decision of the 
Noteholders of the Most Senior Class of Floating Rate Notes approving a Base Rate Modification 
will bind holders of the junior Notes as well as other relevant creditors even if they have not 
approved such decision. 
2. 
RISKS DERIVED FROM THE ISSUER’S LEGAL NATURE AND OPERATIONS 
2.1. 
Related to the Issuer’s nature, financial situation or activity 
2.1.1. 
Mandatory replacement of the Management Company 
If the Management Company is declared insolvent or its authorisation to operate as a management 
company of securitisation funds is revoked, notwithstanding the effects of such insolvency 
described under section 3.7.2.3 of the Additional Information, it shall find a substitute management 
company for the Fund. 
If four (4) months have elapsed from the occurrence of the event determining the substitution and 
no new management company has been found willing to take over the management of the Fund, 
the Management Company shall early liquidate the Fund and the Notes shall be subject to early 
redemption in accordance with section 4.4.3.1 of the Registration Document. 
2.1.2. 
Limitation of actions 
Noteholders and other creditors of the Fund shall have no recourse whatsoever against Borrowers 
who have defaulted on their payment obligations under the Loans, or against the Seller. Any such 
rights shall lie with the Management Company, representing the Fund. 
Noteholders and all other creditors of the Fund shall have no recourse whatsoever against the 
Management Company other than in case of breach by the Management Company’ of its 
obligations or failure to comply with the provisions of this Prospectus, the Deed of Incorporation, 
the other Transaction Documents, and the applicable laws and regulations. Those actions shall be 
resolved in the relevant ordinary declaratory proceedings depending on the amount claimed. 
In particular, Noteholders and all other creditors of the Fund shall have no recourse whatsoever 
against the Fund or against the Management Company in the following scenarios: 
− 
Payment default of amounts due by the Fund resulting from the existence of Receivable 
default or prepayment, 
− 
Breach by the Seller or by any other counterparties of their obligations under the 
corresponding Transaction Documents entered into by the Management Company for and 
on behalf of the Fund, or 


 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Risk Factors 
 
 
30 
 
− 
Shortfall of the financial hedging transactions for servicing the Notes. 
2.1.3. 
Inexistence of meeting of creditors 
Article 21(10) of the EU Securitisation Regulation provides that the transaction documentation 
shall include clear provisions that facilitate the timely resolution of conflicts between different 
classes of investors. 
Whilst the Deed of Incorporation does not contemplate Noteholders having voting rights or the 
ability to call creditors' meetings in the terms of article 37 of Law 5/2015, of 27 April, on the 
Promotion of Enterprise Funding (“Ley 5/2015, de 27 de abril, de fomento de la financiación 
empresarial”) (as amended, “Law 5/2015”), pursuant to article 26.1.a) of Law 5/2015, the 
Management Company, as legal representative of the Fund, is legally required to protect the 
interest of the Noteholders and other creditors of the Fund and ensure that the Fund is operated in 
accordance with the provisions of the Deed of Incorporation. Under Law 5/2015, and the general 
principles of Spanish law, in case of conflicts between different classes of Noteholders, the 
Management Company, where appropriate, will make a decision on the relevant issue to ensure 
timely resolution of such conflict. Under Spanish law, the Management Company would generally 
be required to give preference to the holders of the most senior Class of Notes. 
The ability to defend the Noteholders’ interests depends on the resources of the Management 
Company, which, under article 26 of Law 5/2015, shall act with maximum due diligence and 
transparency in the defence of the interests of the Noteholders and the creditors, and in the 
management of the Receivables. 
In addition, the Noteholders will have no recourse against the Management Company, other than 
for (i) non-performance of its duties or (ii) non-compliance with the provisions of the Deed of 
Incorporation, the rest of the Transaction Documents and the applicable laws and regulations 
(those duties including, among others, exercising and enforcing all of rights and remedies of the 
Fund under the Transaction Documents to which the Fund is a party). The Management Company 
is however not responsible for any of the Fund’s liabilities. 
Additionally, although it is not contemplated that Noteholders have voting rights or the ability to 
call creditors' meetings, Noteholders representing at least 10 per cent of the Outstanding Principal 
Balance of the Most Senior Class of Floating Rate Notes can reject a Base Rate Modification, as 
set forth in section 4.8.4 of the Securities Note. 
2.2. 
Related to legal and regulatory risks 
2.2.1. 
EU Securitisation Regulation: simple, transparent and standardised securitisation. UK 
Securitisation Regulation: Non-compliance with UK STS regime. 
On 12 December 2017, the European Parliament adopted the EU Securitisation Regulation which 
applies to the fullest extent to the Notes. 
The transaction envisaged under this Prospectus is intended to qualify as a simple, transparent and 
standardised securitisation (STS securitisation) within the meaning of article 18 of the EU 
Securitisation Regulation. Consequently, the Seller will submit on or about the Date of 
Incorporation (and in any case within fifteen (15) calendar days from the Date of Incorporation) an 
STS notification to ESMA pursuant to which compliance with the requirements of articles 19 to 22 
of the EU Securitisation Regulation shall be notified to ESMA in order to request that the 
securitisation transaction described in this Prospectus is included in the relevant ESMA STS 
register within the meaning of article 27(5) of the EU Securitisation Regulation. Additionally, the 


 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Risk Factors 
 
 
31 
 
Management Company, by virtue of a delegation by the Seller shall notify the CNMV -in its 
capacity as competent authority- of the submission of such mandatory STS Notification from the 
Seller to ESMA, and attaching such notification. 
For these purposes, the Seller has appointed Prime Collateralised Securities (PCS) EU SAS 
(“PCS”) as a verification agent authorised under article 28 of the EU Securitisation Regulation, in 
connection with an assessment of the compliance with the requirements of articles 19 to 22 of the 
EU Securitisation Regulation (the “STS Verification”). It is important to note that the 
involvement of PCS as the authorised verification agent is not mandatory and the responsibility for 
compliance with the EU Securitisation Regulation remains with the relevant institutional investors, 
the Originator and the Fund, as applicable in each case. The STS Verification will not absolve such 
entities from making their own assessments with respect to the EU Securitisation Regulation, and 
the STS Verification cannot be relied on to determine compliance with the foregoing regulations in 
the absence of such assessments by the relevant entities.  
No assurance can be provided that the securitisation transaction described in this Prospectus will 
receive the STS Verification (either before issuance or at any time thereafter), and if the 
securitisation transaction described in this Prospectus does not receive the STS Verification, this 
shall not, under any circumstances, affect the liability of SCF (as Originator) and the Fund in 
respect of their legal obligations under the EU Securitisation Regulation, nor shall it affect the 
obligations imposed on institutional investors as set forth in article 5 of the EU Securitisation 
Regulation. 
None of the Issuer, the Reporting Entity, the Arranger, the Lead Manager, or any other party to the 
Transaction Documents makes any representation or accepts any liability for (i) the inclusion of 
the securitisation transaction in the list administered by ESMA within the meaning of article 27 of 
the EU Securitisation Regulation or (ii) the securitisation transaction to qualify as an STS-
securitisation under the EU Securitisation Regulation at any point in time. 
Non-compliance with the status of an STS-securitisation may result in higher capital requirements 
for investors, as well as in various administrative sanctions and/or remedial measures being 
imposed on the Fund or the Seller. Any of such administrative sanctions and/or remedial measures 
may affect the ability of the Issuer to fulfil its payment obligations under the Notes. 
Finally, since 1 January 2021, the EU Securitisation Regulation forms part of the domestic law of 
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (UK) by virtue of the EUWA. None of 
the Seller (as originator) or the Fund (as SSPE) under the UK Securitisation Regulation are 
actively seeking to comply with the requirements of the UK Securitisation Regulation. UK 
investors should be aware of this and should note that their regulatory position may be affected. 
The Transaction will not be a UK STS Transaction and will therefore not be notified to the UK 
Financial Conduct Authority for that purpose.

which may be acquired on each Payment Date during the Revolving Period (which will end on the 
Payment Date falling on December 2023 (included), unless the Revolving Period is early 
terminated, as provided in item 4.9.2.1 of the Securities Note). 
The open-end nature of the Fund will end, and thus the sale of Additional Receivables to the Fund

The Deed of Incorporation of the Fund may also be amended at the request of the CNMV. 
The Management Company represents that the content of the Deed of Incorporation will not 
contradict that of the Prospectus and that the Deed of Incorporation will coincide with the draft 
public deed (escritura pública) that has been submitted to the CNMV in connection with the

4.4.2. 
Period of activity of the Fund. 
It is expected that the life of the Fund runs from the Date of Incorporation until the Legal Maturity 
Date of the Fund (i.e., until 20 September 2038, subject to the Modified Following Business Day 
Convention), unless the Fund is early liquidated or cancelled in accordance with the provisions of 
sections 4.4.3 and 4.4.4 below. 
4.4.3. 
Early Liquidation of the Fund. 
4.4.3.1. 
Mandatory early liquidation of the Fund 
The Management Company shall proceed to carry out the early liquidation of the Fund (the “Early 
Liquidation of the Fund”) and, hence, the early redemption of the whole (but not part) of the 
Notes (the “Early Redemption of the Notes”) upon the occurrence of any of the following 
events: 
(i) 
if, as stated in article 33 of Law 5/2015, four (4) months have elapsed since the occurrence 
of an event giving rise to the mandatory replacement of the Management Company due to a 
declaration of insolvency thereof, or 
(ii) 
in the event of revocation of the authorisation of the Management Company, 
in either case, without a new management company having been found that is prepared to take 
over management of the Fund and that is appointed pursuant to section 3.7.2 of the Additional 
Information. 
In order for the Management Company to carry out the Early Liquidation of the Fund, and 
therefore, the Early Redemption of the Notes, the Management Company shall sell the 
Receivables and any remaining assets of the Fund in accordance with the provisions below. 
Pre-emptive right of the Seller to acquire the Receivables 


 
 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Registration Document 
 
 
36 
 
Upon the occurrence of any of the events indicated in paragraphs (i) and (ii) above, the Seller will 
have the right, but not the obligation, to repurchase the outstanding Receivables at the time of 
early liquidation of the Fund at a price equal to the Final Repurchase Price (as defined below). 
In order for the Seller to exercise this right, the Management Company shall notify in writing to 
the Seller that the Early Liquidation of the Fund will be carried out immediately and in any case 
within thirty (30) Business Days from the occurrence of any of the events indicated in paragraphs 
(i) and (ii) above. 
Upon receiving such notification, the Seller will have a period of five (5) Business Days from the 
date on which it receives such notification to communicate its decision to repurchase or not the 
Receivables at the Final Repurchase Price. 
If the Seller confirms its decision to repurchase the Receivables, the transfer of the Receivables to 
the Seller must be completed within fifteen (15) Business Days from the date on which the Seller 
communicates such decision. 
For the avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances will the Seller have an obligation to 
repurchase any of the Receivables in the above events. 
Sale of the Receivables to third parties 
In case the Seller decides not to exercise its right to repurchase the Receivables in accordance with 
the provisions of the preceding section, the Management Company shall request binding bids from 
at least three (3) entities, at its sole discretion, among entities that are active in the purchase and 
sale of similar assets. 
The Management Company shall be entitled to obtain any valuation reports it deems necessary 
from any one or several specialised entities in order to assess the value of the Receivables. The 
Management Company shall set forth the terms and conditions of the bidding process (including, 
without limitation, the information to be provided to the bidders and deadline to submit the bids) 
in the manner it considers best to maximise the value of the Receivables. 
The highest bid received from the entities referred to above shall be accepted by Management 
Company and will determine the value of the Receivables. If no relevant offer is received from 
any third parties, then the Receivables shall remain as assets of the Fund, without prejudice to the 
possibility of the Management Company to start a new bidding process for the sale of the 
Receivables. 
Common provisions 
The purchase price paid by the Seller or the third party will be paid to the Treasury Account and 
shall form part of the Available Funds to be applied in accordance with the Post-Enforcement 
Priority of Payments set forth in section 3.4.7.3 of the Additional Information. 
The Management Company shall be entitled to sell the Receivables even if the holders of any of 
the Classes of Notes suffer a loss. 
For the above purposes, the payment obligations under the Notes on the Early Redemption Date 
shall mean the Principal Amount Outstanding of the Notes on that date plus the unpaid accrued 
interest to that date, amounts that, to all legal effects, will be deemed past due and payable 
(líquido, vencido y exigible) on the Early Redemption Date.

The above procedure does not entitle the automatic liquidation of the underlying receivables for 
the purposes of article 21.4 of the EU Securitisation Regulation. 
Notice of the liquidation of the Fund will be provided to the CNMV by publishing the appropriate 
relevant fact communication (comunicación de otra información relevante) and thereafter to the 
Rating Agencies and the Noteholders in the manner established in section 4.2.3 of the Additional 
Information, at least thirty (30) Business Days in advance of the Early Redemption Date. 
4.4.3.2. 
Early liquidation of the Fund at the Seller’s initiative 
The Seller will have the right (but not the obligation) to instruct the Management Company to 
carry out the Early Liquidation of the Fund and the Early Redemption of the Notes in whole (but 
not in part): 
(i) 
upon the occurrence of a Clean-up Call Event; or 
(ii) 
upon the occurrence of a Tax Call Event. 
provided that, in case of the Clean-up Call Event, the Seller can only exercise this right to the 
extent that there are sufficient Available Funds to redeem the Floating Rate Notes  in full. 
Upon the exercise by the Seller of a Seller’s Call following the occurrence of a Clean-Up Call 
Event or a Tax Call Event, the Seller may repurchase all outstanding Receivables at the Final 
Repurchase Price (as this term is defined below). 
Given the Final Repurchase Price mentioned above, any potential investor in the Notes should be 
aware that the occurrence of Tax Call Event may result in the Principal Amount Outstanding of the 
Notes, if any, not being redeemed in full. 
Given the Final Repurchase Price mentioned above, any potential investor in the Class F Notes

Accounting Standards Board (IASB) in July 2014, which introduced an “expected credit loss”

Receivable, any amount that constitutes any expected credit loss for such Delinquent Receivable 
or Defaulted Receivable as determined by the Seller in accordance with International Financial

promulgated by the International Accounting Standards Board in order to replace IFRS 9.

value of debt securities valued at amortised cost and included in mortgage-backed securities 
funds and asset-backed securities funds, the rules foreseen by the CIT Regulations in force 
until 31 December 2015, and not the rules in force as from 1 January 2016 (after the 
amendment of the CIT Regulations in 30 June 2017), will be applicable to the Fund until

Bank of Spain, having its registered office at Ciudad Grupo Santander, Avenida de 
Cantabria, s/n, Boadilla del Monte (Madrid), Spain, with tax identification number A 
28122570. 
SCF’s activity is subject to the Spanish legislative regime applicable to financial 
institutions in general and, in particular, to the supervision, control and rules of the Bank of 
Spain and the CNMV. 
SCF´s objective is to receive funds from the public in the form of deposits, loans, repos or 
other similar transactions entailing the obligation to refund them, and to use these funds for 
its own account to grant loans and credits or to perform similar transactions. In addition, 
SCF is the holding company of a finance group (“Consumer Group”) and handles the 
investments of its subsidiaries. 
SCF is fully owned by Banco Santander, S.A, which had a 100% direct and indirect 
ownership interest in the share capital of SCF as of 31 December 2021. Banco Santander, 
S.A. has its registered office at Paseo de Pereda 9-12, Santander.

and engages in finance leasing, financing of third party purchases of consumer goods of 
any kind, full-service leasing (“renting”) and other activities.

31 December 2021, the European Consumer Group had 250 branches throughout Europe, 
49 of them in Spain (256 branches at 31 December 2020, 49 of them in Spain). 
In 2020, after obtaining the relevant authorisation to operate in the Hellenic Republic (also 
known as Greece), SCF set up a new branch in the country focused at financing the 
purchase of all types of consumer goods by third parties, financial leasing, renting and other 
activities.  
During 2021 and following the merger of SCF with its subsidiaries Santander Consumer 
Bank, S.A., Banco Santander Consumer Portugal, S.A. and Santander Consumer Finance 
Benelux, B.V., new branches have been established in Belgium, Portugal and the 
Netherlands in order to provide continuity to the activities provided so far. In August 2021, 
the Consumer Group underwent a corporate reorganisation whereby PSA Financial 
Services Spain, E.F.C., S.A. acquired 100% of the shares of PSA Finance Belux, S.A. and 
PSA Financial Services Nederland, B.V. Prior to the acquisition, both entities were 
indirectly already controlled by SCF. Santander Consumer Finance, S.A. (Belgian Branch) 
and Banque PSA Finance owned directly 50% each of the shares of PSA Finance Belux, 
S.A., and Santander Consumer Finance Benelux, B.V. and Banque PSA Finance, S.A.

There is no knowledge of the existence of any other relationship involving direct or indirect 
ownership or control between the aforementioned legal persons that participate in the 
securitisation transaction. 
In addition, it should be noted that certain parties to the transaction documents (the “Transaction 
Parties”) have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, investment banking and/or 
commercial banking or other services for the Fund, the Seller or its affiliates and the Management 
Company in the ordinary course of business. Other Transaction Parties may also perform multiple 
roles. Accordingly, conflicts of interest may exist or may arise as a result of or in connection with 
parties having previously engaged or in the future engaging in transactions with other parties, 
having multiple roles or carrying out other transactions for third parties. The Transaction Parties 
may be replaced by one or more new parties. It cannot be excluded that such a new party could 
also have a potential conflicting interest, which might ultimately have a negative impact on the 
ability of the Fund to perform its obligations in respect of the Notes. 
In particular, the Arranger and the Lead Manager are part of global investment banking and 
securities and investment management firms that provide a wide range of financial services to a 
substantial and diversified client base that includes corporations, financial institutions, 
governments and high-net-worth individuals. As such, they actively make markets in and trade 
financial instruments for their own account and for the accounts of customers in the ordinary 
course of its business.  
In particular, the Arranger and the Lead Manager and their affiliates may play various roles in 
relation to the offering of the Notes. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the 
duties of the Arranger and Lead Manager and/or their affiliates in respect of the Notes are limited 
to the relevant contractual obligations set out in the Transaction Documents (if any) and, in 
particular, no advisory or fiduciary duty is owed to any person. None of the Arranger, the Lead 
Manager or their affiliates shall have any obligation to account to the Fund, any party to the 
Transaction or any Noteholder for any profit as a result of any other business that it may conduct 
with either the Fund or any party to the transaction. 
The Arranger and the Lead Manager may assist clients and counterparties in transactions related to 
the Notes (including assisting clients in future purchases and sales of the Notes and hedging 
transactions). The Arranger and the Lead Manager expect to earn fees and other revenues from 
these transactions.

services similar to those provided for in the Transaction Documents to other persons, firms or 
companies or from carrying on any business similar to or in competition with the business of any 
Transaction Parties. 
Accordingly, conflicts of interest may exist or may arise as a result of the Transaction Parties:  
(i) 
having previously engaged or in the future engaging in transactions with other parties to the 
transaction;  
(ii) 
having multiple roles in this transaction; and/or (c) carrying out other roles or transactions 
for third parties. 
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, none of the Arranger, the Lead Manager 
and/or their affiliates are restricted from entering into, performing or enforcing its rights in respect 
of the Transaction Documents, the Notes, or the interests described above and may otherwise 
continue or take steps to further or protect any of those interests and its business even where to do

65 
 
(i) 
The Lead Manager will, on a best-efforts basis and upon the satisfaction of certain conditions

The Lead Manager may give a termination notice to the Management Company, at any time before 
15.00 CET on the Disbursement Date upon occurrence of, among others, the following termination 
events:

in case that the Seller elects not to, or otherwise fails to, subscribe for and purchase any 
remaining Notes that the Lead Manager has not procured subscription for, by the end of the 
relevant time limit;

Force majeure: since the date of the Management, Placement and Subscription Agreement 
there has been, in the reasonable opinion of the Lead Manager in consultation with the 
Seller and the Management Company, an event that could not be foreseen or, even if 
foreseen, is inevitable rendering it impossible to perform the subscription or disbursement 
of the Notes or the success of the placement of the Notes pursuant to article 1,105 of the 
Civil Code (force majeure); and

condition (financial or otherwise), business, prospects, results of operations or general affairs or

provided for by the Management, Placement and Subscription Agreement. Persons into whose 
possession this Prospectus (or any part of it) comes are required by the Fund to inform themselves 
about, and to observe, any such restrictions. Neither this Prospectus nor any part of it constitutes 


 
 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Securities Note 
 
 
66 
 
an offer, or may be used for the purpose of an offer to sell any of the Notes, or a solicitation of an 
offer to buy any of the Notes, by anyone in any jurisdiction or in any circumstances in which such 
offer or solicitation is not authorised or is unlawful. 
This Prospectus is not intended to provide the basis of any credit or other evaluation and should 
not be considered as a recommendation by the Fund, the Management Company, the Arranger or 
the Lead Manager that any recipient of this Prospectus should purchase any of the Notes. Each 
investor contemplating purchasing Notes should make its own independent investigation of the 
portfolio of Loans and of the financial condition and affairs, and its own appraisal of the 
creditworthiness, of the Fund. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, neither the Arranger nor the Lead Manager accept any 
responsibility whatsoever for the contents of this Prospectus or for any other statement, made or 
purported to be made by the Arranger or Lead Manager or on their behalf, in connection with the 
Fund, the Seller, any other Transaction Party or the issue and offering of the Notes. Each of the 
Arranger and the Lead Manager accordingly disclaims all and any liability, whether arising in tort 
or contract or otherwise, which it might otherwise have in respect of this Prospectus or any such 
statement. 
The Notes may not be offered or sold directly or indirectly, and neither this Prospectus nor any 
other prospectus, form of application, advertisement, other offering material or other information 
relating to the Fund or the Notes may be issued, distributed or published in any country or 
jurisdiction, except under circumstances that will result in compliance with all applicable laws, 
orders, rules and regulations. 
The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act or the “blue sky” 
laws of any state of the U.S. or other jurisdiction and the Notes may not be offered, sold or 
delivered within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (as defined 
in Regulation S under the Securities Act) except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction 
not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state or local 
securities laws. The Notes are in dematerialised form and are subject to U.S. tax law requirements. 
The Notes are being offered for sale outside the United States in accordance with Regulation S 
under the Securities Act. Neither the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, nor any 
state securities commission or any other regulatory authority, has approved or disapproved the 
Notes or determined that this Prospectus is truthful or complete. Any representation to the contrary 
is a criminal offence. 
Neither the Arranger nor the Lead Manager nor any of their affiliates makes any representation to 
any prospective investor or purchaser of the Notes as to whether the transactions described in this 
Prospectus comply as a matter of fact with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules on the Date of 
Incorporation or at any time in the future. Investors should consult their own advisers as to the 
U.S. Risk Retention Rules. No predictions can be made as to the precise effects of such matters on 
any investor or otherwise. 
4.2.5. 
VOLCKER RULE 
Under section 619 of the U.S. Dodd-Frank Act and the corresponding implementing rules (the 
“Volcker Rule”), U.S. banks, non-U.S. banks with U.S. branches or agencies, companies that 
control U.S. banks, and their U.S. and non-U.S. affiliates (collectively, the “Relevant Banking 
Entities” as defined under the Volcker Rule) are prohibited from, inter alia, acquiring or retaining 
any ownership interest in, or acting as sponsor in respect of, certain investment entities referred to 
in the Volcker Rule as covered funds, except as may be permitted by an applicable exclusion or 
exemption from the Volcker Rule. In addition, in certain circumstances, the Volcker Rule restricts 


 
 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Securities Note 
 
 
67 
 
Relevant Banking Entities from entering into certain credit exposure related transactions with 
covered funds. 
Neither the Issuer nor the Arranger nor the Lead Manager nor the Management Company have 
made any determination as to whether the Issuer would be a “covered fund” for the purposes of the 
Volcker Rule. If the Issuer was considered as a “covered fund”, the price and liquidity of the 
market for the Notes may be materially and adversely affected. 
There is limited interpretative guidance regarding the Volcker Rule, and implementation of the 
regulatory framework for the Volcker Rule is still evolving. The Volcker Rule's prohibitions and 
lack of interpretive guidance could negatively impact the liquidity and value of the Notes. Any 
entity that is a “Relevant Banking Entity” and is considering an investment in the Notes should 
consider the potential impact of the Volcker Rule in respect of such investment and on its portfolio 
generally. Each purchaser must determine for itself whether it is a Relevant Banking Entity. 
Neither the Issuer nor the Arranger nor the Management Company nor the Lead Manager makes 
any representation regarding the ability of any purchaser to acquire or hold the Notes, now or at 
any time in the future. 
4.3.

Special consideration regarding interest payments of the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes:  
Interest payments of the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes are placed seventh (7th) and ninth 
(9th) in the Pre-Enforcement Priority of Payments, respectively. However, upon the occurrence of 
a Class E and Class F Notes Interest Deferral Trigger, interest payments of the Class E Notes and 
the Class F Notes would be deferred and therefore would be placed eleventh (11th) and twelfth 
(12th) in the Pre Enforcement Priority of Payments, respectively.  
For these purposes, “Class E and Class F Notes Interest Deferral Trigger” means a Cumulative 
Loss Ratio higher than 3.00%.  
For clarification purposes, if the Cumulative Loss Ratio falls below 3% again, interest payments of

B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes and the Class E Notes will be sequential in 
accordance with the Pre-Enforcement Priority of Payments set forth in section 3.4.7.2 of the

4.7. 
Description of the rights, including any limitations of these, attached to the securities and 
procedure for the exercise of such rights 
Pursuant to current legislation in force, the Notes described in this Securities Note do not create 
any present and/or future political rights for the investor acquiring them in relation to the Fund or 
its Management Company. This is consistent with the nature of the FONDO DE TITULIZACIÓN 
as a separate estate (patrimonio separado) devoid of legal personality, according to the provisions 
of Law 5/2015. 
The economic rights of the investor associated with the acquisition and holding of the Notes will 
be those deriving from the interest rates, yields and redemption prices with which the Notes are 
issued as set forth in sections 4.8 and 4.9 below. 
The Noteholders are subject, with respect to the payment of interest and principal repayment of the 
Notes, to the Pre-Enforcement Priority of Payments or the Post-Enforcement Priority of Payments, 
as applicable, set forth in section 3.4.7 of the Additional Information. 
The Noteholders will have no recourse against the Management Company, other than for non-
performance of its duties or non-compliance with the provisions of the the Transaction Documents 
and the applicable laws and regulations. In this regard, Noteholders will have no recourse 
whatsoever against the Fund or the Management Company based on (i) delinquency or 
prepayment of the Receivables; (ii) non-fulfilment by the counterparties of the Transaction 
Documents entered in the name and on behalf of the Fund; or (iii) the insufficiency of the credit 
enhancements to cover the payments of the Notes. 


 
 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Securities Note 
 
 
73 
 
The Noteholders shall have no actions against the Borrowers that have failed to comply with their 
payment obligations. Pursuant to applicable law, the Management Company is the only authorised 
representative of the Fund as regards third parties and in any legal proceedings (without prejudice 
to any rights of representation that may be granted by the Management Company to third parties). 
Each of the Noteholders by purchasing or subscribing the Notes acknowledges and agrees in 
favour of the Fund, represented by the Management Company, that: 
(i) 
sums payable to each Noteholder in respect of the Fund's obligations to such Noteholder 
shall be limited to the lesser of (a) the aggregate amount of all sums due and payable to 
such Noteholder and (b) the aggregate amounts of the Available Funds, net of any sums 
which are payable to other persons in priority to or pari passu with such Noteholder in 
accordance with the Pre-Enforcement Priority of Payments or the Post-Enforcement 
Priority of Payments, as applicable, set forth in section 3.4.7 of the Additional Information; 
(ii) 
upon liquidation of the Fund and following final distribution of the Available Funds, the 
Noteholders shall have no further claim against the Fund in respect of any unpaid amounts 
and such unpaid amounts shall be discharged in full; 
(iii) 
none of the Management Company, the Arranger, the Lead Manager or any other 
Transaction Parties shall be responsible for any of the Fund’s liabilities; 
(iv) 
in particular, the Noteholders shall not have any claim or right of action against the 
Management Company other than by reason of non-performance of its duties or non-
compliance with the provisions of the Deed of Incorporation, the rest of the Transaction 
Document and the applicable laws and regulations; and 
(v) 
no meeting of creditors (junta de acreedores) will be established. 
Various potential and actual conflicts of interest may arise between the interests of the 
Noteholders, on the one hand, and the interests of any of the Transaction Parties, on the other 
hand, as a result of the various businesses and activities of the Transaction Parties, and none of 
such persons is required to resolve such conflicts of interest in favour of the Noteholders except 
for the obligations legally vested on the Management Company, who, pursuant to article 26.1.f) of 
Law 5/2015 must have in place procedural and organisational measures to prevent potential 
conflicts of interests. 
The Management Company will be liable to the Noteholders and other creditors of the Fund for all 
damages caused thereto by a breach of its obligations. It will be liable for the penalties applicable 
thereto pursuant to the provisions of Law 5/2015. 
The obligations of the Seller and of the other entities participating in the transaction are limited to 
those included in the corresponding Transaction Documents to which each of them are parties, the 
most significant ones being described in this Prospectus and in the Deed of Incorporation. 
All matters, disputes, actions and claims concerning the Fund or the Notes issued and that may 
arise during the operation or liquidation thereof, whether among the Noteholders or between the 
Noteholders and the Management Company, will be submitted to the Courts of the City of Madrid, 
waiving any other forum to which the parties may be entitled.

the purposes of the Reference Rate relating to EURIBOR without the need to modify the 
terms of the Reference Rate and without the need to notify to the Noteholders.

If the Screen Rate is unavailable at such time for Euro deposits for the relevant period, then 
the rate for any relevant period shall be determined in accordance with section 4.8.4 of the

Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Securities Note 
 
 
76 
 
(a) 
the original Reference Rate ceasing to be published for a period of at least 5 
Business Days or ceasing to exist; or

(e) 
the making of a public statement by or on behalf of the supervisor of the 
administrator of the EURIBOR that (I) the EURIBOR is or will be (or is or will be 
deemed by such supervisor to be) no longer representative of its relevant underlying 
market, and (II) such representativeness will not be restored (as determined by such 
supervisor); or 
(f) 
it has become unlawful for any Paying Agent, the EURIBOR Provider, the Swap 
Calculation Agent, the Fund or other party to calculate any payments due to be made 
using the original Reference Rate. 
provided that the Base Rate Modification Event shall be deemed to occur (1) in the case of 
sub-paragraph (a) above, on the date of cessation of publication for a period of at least 5 
Business Days or ceasing to exist, (2) in the case of sub-paragraphs (b) and (c) above, on 
the date of the cessation of publication of the EURIBOR or the discontinuation of the 
EURIBOR, as the case may be, (3) in the case of sub-paragraph (d) above, on the date of 
the prohibition of use of the EURIBOR, (4) in the case of sub-paragraph (e) above, on the 
date with effect from which the EURIBOR will no longer be (or will be deemed by the 
relevant supervisor to no longer be) representative of its relevant underlying market and 
which is specified in the relevant public statement, and, in each case, not the date of the 
relevant public statement, and (5) in the case of sub-paragraph (f) above, on the date in 
which such unlawfulness is communicated by the relevant party.

Following the occurrence of a Base Rate Modification Event, the Management Company, 
in the name and on behalf of the Fund (acting on the advice of the Originator) will inform

Determination Agent”). 
(iii) 
The Rate Determination Agent shall determine an alternative base rate (the “Alternative 
Base Rate”) to replace EURIBOR as the Reference Rate of the Floating Rate Notes and the 
Subordinated Loan Agreement and those amendments to the Transaction Documents to be 
made by the Management Company, in the name and on behalf of the Fund, as are 
necessary or advisable to facilitate such change (the “Base Rate Modification”), provided 
that no such Base Rate Modification will be made unless the Rate Determination Agent has 
determined and confirmed to the Management Company in writing that: 


 
 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Securities Note 
 
 
77 
 
(a) 
such Base Rate Modification is being undertaken due to the occurrence of a Base 
Rate Modification Event and, in each case, such modification is required solely for 
such purpose and it has been drafted solely to such effect; and 
(b) 
such Alternative Base Rate is: 
(1) 
a base rate published, endorsed, approved or recognised by the relevant 
regulatory authority or any stock exchange on which the Notes are listed or 
any relevant committee or other body established, sponsored or approved by 
any of the foregoing; or 
(2) 
a base rate utilised in a material number of publicly-listed new issues of Euro 
denominated asset backed floating rate notes prior to the effective date of 
such Base Rate Modification; or 
(3) 
a base rate utilised in a publicly-listed new issue of Euro denominated asset 
backed floating rate notes where the originator of the relevant assets is SCF 
or an affiliate of SCF banking group; or 
(4) 
such other base rate as the Rate Determination Agent reasonably determines 
(and in relation to which the Rate Determination Agent has provided 
reasonable justification of its determination to the Management Company), or 
provided that, for the avoidance of doubt (A) in each case, the change to the Alternative 
Base Rate will not, in the Management Company’s opinion, be materially prejudicial to the 
interest of the Noteholders and the Subordinated Loan Provider; (B) for the avoidance of 
doubt, the Management Company may propose an Alternative Base Rate on more than one 
occasion provided that the conditions set out in this paragraph (iii) are satisfied, and (C) the 
Alternative Base Rate shall fulfil the requirements of the Benchmark Regulation. 
By subscribing the Notes, each Noteholder acknowledges and agrees with any amendments 
to the Transaction Documents made by the Management Company, in the name and on 
behalf of the Fund, which may be necessary or advisable in order to facilitate the Base Rate 
Modification. 
(iv) 
Any such Base Rate Modification shall not be carried out unless: 
(a) 
the Interest Rate Swap Transaction is amended to align the Reference Rates 
applicable under the Floating Rate Notes and the Interest Rate Swap Transactions 
and such amendment takes effect at the same time as the Base Rate Modification 
takes effect; 
(b) 
the Seller pays (or arranges for the payment of) all fees, costs and expenses 
(including legal fees) properly incurred by the Management Company and each 
other applicable party including, without limitation, any of the Transaction Parties, 
in connection with such modifications. For the avoidance of doubt, such costs shall 
not include any amount in respect of any reduction in the interest payable to a 
Noteholder or any change in the amount due to the Swap Counterparty or any 
change in the mark-to-market value of the Interest Rate Swap Transaction; and 
(c) 
with respect to each Rating Agency, the Management Company has notified such 
Rating Agency of the proposed modification and, in the Management Company’s 


 
 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Securities Note 
 
 
78 
 
reasonable opinion, formed on the basis of due consideration and consultation with 
such Rating Agency (including, as applicable, upon receipt of oral confirmation 
from an appropriately authorised person at such Rating Agency), such modification 
would not result in (1) a downgrade, withdrawal or suspension of the then current 
ratings assigned to the Floating Rate Notes by such Rating Agency or (2) such 
Rating Agency placing the Floating Rate Notes on rating watch negative (or 
equivalent). 
(v) 
When implementing any modification pursuant to this section 4.8.4, the Rate Determination 
Agent, the Management Company and the Seller, as applicable, shall act in good faith and 
(in the absence of gross negligence or wilful misconduct), shall have no responsibility 
whatsoever to the Noteholders or any other party. 
(vi) 
If a Base Rate Modification is not made as a result of the application of paragraph (iii) 
above, and for so long as the Management Company (acting on the advice of the Seller) 
considers that a Base Rate Modification Event is continuing, the Management Company 
may or, upon request of the Originator, must, initiate the procedure for a Base Rate 
Modification as set out in this section 4.8.4. 
(vii) 
Any modification pursuant to this section 4.8.4 must comply with the rules of any stock 
exchange on which the Notes are from time to time listed or admitted to trading and may be 
made on more than one occasion. 
(viii) As long as a Base Rate Modification is not deemed final and binding in accordance with 
this section 4.8.4, the Reference Rate applicable to the Floating Rate Notes will be equal to 
the last Reference Rate available on the relevant applicable screen rate pursuant to 
paragraph (i) above. 
(ix) 
This section 4.8.4 shall be without prejudice to the application of any higher interest under 
applicable mandatory law. 
(x)

(xi) 
The Management Company, acting in the name and on behalf of the Fund, shall provide to 
the Noteholders a Base Rate Modification Noteholder Notice, at least 40 calendar days 
prior to the date on which it is proposed that the Base Rate Modification would take effect 
(such date being no less than 10 Business Days prior to the next Determination Date). 
(xii) 
Noteholders representing at least 10 per cent of the Outstanding Principal Balance of the 
Most Senior Class of Floating Rate Notes on the Base Rate Modification Record Date shall 
not have directed the Management Company (acting on behalf of the Fund) in writing (or 
otherwise directed the Paying Agent in accordance with the then current practice of any 
applicable clearing system through which such Most Senior Class of Floating Rate Notes 
may be held) within such notification period that such Noteholders of the Most Senior 
Class of Floating Rate Notes do not consent to the Base Rate Modification. 
Noteholder negative consent rights 
If Noteholders representing at least 10 per cent. of the Outstanding Principal Balance of the Most 
Senior Class of Floating Rate Notes on the Base Rate Modification Record Date have directed the

79 
 
Management Company (acting on behalf of the Fund) in writing (or otherwise directed the Paying 
Agent in accordance with the current practice of any applicable clearing system through which 
such Most Senior Class of Floating Rate Notes may be held) within the notification period referred 
to above that such Noteholders of the Most Senior Class of Floating Rate Notes do not consent to

be carried out in accordance with the following formula: 
 I = P*R/100*d/360 
 
 
Where: 
 I = Interest to be paid per Note on a given Payment Date, rounded (if necessary) to the second 
decimal place, with 0.005 being rounded upwards.

 P = Principal Amount Outstanding of the Notes on the Determination Date preceding such 
Payment Date. 
 R = Nominal interest rate expressed as a percentage. 
 d = Number of calendar days actually elapsed in each Interest Accrual Period. 
4.8.6. 
Time limit for the validity of claims to interest and repayment of principal 
Interest on the Notes will be paid until their full redemption on each Payment Date according to 
the Pre-Enforcement Priority of Payments specified in section 3.4.7.2 of the Additional 
Information or, if applicable, according to the Post-Enforcement Priority of Payments contained in 
section 3.4.7.3 of the Additional Information, provided that the Fund has sufficient Available 
Funds. 
In the event that, on a Payment Date, the Fund is totally or partially unable to pay the interest 
accrued on the Notes according to the Pre-Enforcement Priority of Payments or the Post-
Enforcement Priority of Payments, as applicable, set forth in sections 3.4.7.2 or 3.4.7.3 of the 
Additional Information, respectively, the amounts that the Noteholders do not receive will be paid 
on the following Payment Date on which the Fund has sufficient Available Funds to do so at the 
relevant Interest Rate for each Note in accordance with the Pre-Enforcement Priority of Payments 
or the Post-Enforcement Priority of Payments, as applicable. Amounts deferred will accrue 
ordinary interest but not default interest. 
The Fund, through its Management Company, may not defer the payment of any interest on the 
Notes beyond the Legal Maturity Date of the Fund (subject to the Modified Following Business 
Day Convention). Upon liquidation of the Fund (including on the Legal Maturity Date), following 
final distribution of the Available Funds, the Noteholders shall have no further claim against the 
Fund in respect of any unpaid amounts and such unpaid amounts shall be discharged in full. 
4.8.7. 
Payment dates and interest periods 
Interest in respect of the Notes will accrue on a daily basis and will be payable in Euro in arrears 
on 20 December, 20 March, 20 June and 20 September of each year (each, a “Payment Date”) 
(subject to Modified Following Business Convention), provided that the first Payment Date will 
take place on 20 December 2022 (the “First Payment Date”), in respect of the immediately 
preceding Interest Accrual Period (as defined below), in accordance with the applicable Priority of 
Payments, and will be calculated on the basis of the actual number of calendar days elapsed and a 
360-day year. 
The “Modified Following Business Day Convention” shall apply to all Notes, where if a 
Payment Date or the Legal Maturity Date is not a Business Day, the relevant date shall be 
postponed to the next day that is a Business Day unless in case that it would thereby fall into the 
next calendar month, in which event such date shall be deemed to be the immediately preceding 
Business Day. 
For these purposes, “Business Day” means a day which is a TARGET2 Business Day other than 
(i) a Saturday, (ii) a Sunday or (iii) a public holiday in the City of Madrid (Spain). 
“TARGET2 Business Day” means a day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time

The term of the Notes will be divided into successive interest accrual periods comprising the 
calendar days that have actually elapsed between each Payment Date (each a “Interest Accrual 
Period”). Each Interest Accrual Period will begin on (and including) the previous Payment Date 
and end on (but excluding) such Payment Date. Exceptionally: 
(i) 
the first Interest Accrual Period will begin on the Disbursement Date (included) and will 
end on the First Payment Date (excluded) (the “Initial Interest Accrual Period”); and 
(ii)

accrued on the Notes in accordance with the Pre-Enforcement Priority of Payments or the Post-
Enforcement Priority of Payments set forth in sections 3.4.7.2 or 3.4.7.3 of the Additional 
Information, respectively, the unpaid amounts will be paid on the following Payment Date on 
which the Fund has sufficient Available Funds to do so immediately before the payment of the 
same Class for the new period and without accruing additional or default interest in accordance 
with the aforementioned Pre-Enforcement Priority of Payments, or Post-Enforcement Priority of 
Payments. 
In any case, the Fund cannot defer the payment of interest on the Notes beyond the Legal Maturity 
Date. 
Withholding, contributions or taxes now or hereafter applicable to the principal, interest or returns 
on the Notes will be the sole responsibility of the Noteholders, and the amount thereof will be 
deducted by the Management Company, on behalf of the Fund, through the Paying Agent in the 
manner provided by law. 
Payment will be made through the Paying Agent, which will use Iberclear and its participating 
institutions to distribute the amounts to the Noteholders in accordance with their established 
procedures. Payment of interests and redemption of principal will be notified to the Noteholders in 
the events and with the notice established for each situation described in 4.2.1 of the Additional

4.9.2.1. 
Redemption of the Notes 
During the Revolving Period 
During the Revolving Period, the Noteholders will only receive payments of interest on the Notes 
on each Payment Date and will not receive any principal payment, except as described in section

falling on December 2023 (included), and (ii) the date on which a Revolving Period Early 
Termination Event has occurred (excluded). 
On any Determination Date during the Revolving Period, the occurrence of any of the following 
events shall, inter alia, constitute a “Revolving Period Early Termination Event”: 
(i) 
a Subordination Event occurs; or 
(ii) 
on the Payment Date immediately preceding the relevant Determination Date, the 
Outstanding Balance of the Non-Defaulted Receivables was less than 75.00% of the 
Principal Amount Outstanding of the Floating Rate Notes on the Disbursement Date; or

tax regulations are amended in such a way that the assignment of Additional Receivables 
proves to be excessively onerous to the Seller; 
(iv) 
the audit reports on the Seller’s annual accounts show qualifications, which in the opinion 
of the CNMV, could affect the Additional Receivables; or

Additional Receivables to be acquired on that Payment Date, and (iii) the remaining 
Principal Account balance on that Payment Date after payment of the purchase price related 
to the principal amount of the Additional Receivables. 
During the Pro-Rata Redemption Period 
During the Pro-Rata Redemption Period and for so long as no Subordination Event has occurred, 
the ordinary redemption of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D 
Notes and the Class E Notes will be pari passu and pro-rata without preference or priority 
amongst themselves holding the tenth (10th) place in the Pre-Enforcement Priority of Payments as

This redemption will be made in an amount equal to the Pro-Rata Target Redemption Amount, as 
detailed in section 4.6.3.1 of this Securities Note. 
The Class F Notes shall be redeemed in accordance with the Class F Notes Target Amortisation 
Amount in accordance with the Pre-Enforcement Priority of Payments set forth in section 3.4.7.2 
of the Additional Information. Once the Class F Notes are fully redeemed, the subordination of 
such Class F will no longer apply. 
During the Sequential Redemption Period 
Upon the occurrence of a Subordination Event, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C 
Notes, the Class D Notes and the Class E Notes will be redeemed sequentially in accordance with

Class E Notes and the Class F Notes; 
(ii) 
the Class B Notes will rank pari passu and pro rata without preference or priority amongst

the Class F Notes will rank pari passu and pro rata without preference or priority amongst 
themselves, provided that the Class F Notes will amortise with the available excess 
spread for an amount equal to the Class F Notes Target Amortisation Amount. Once the 
Class F Notes are fully redeemed the subordination of such Class F Notes will no 
longer apply. 
The occurrence of any of the following events in respect of any Determination Date prior to the 
Legal Maturity Date shall constitute a subordination event (each a “Subordination Event”): 
(i) 
an Insolvency Event occurs in respect of the Seller; or

the Seller defaults in the performance or observance of any of its obligations under any of 
the Transaction Documents to which it is a party (unless such default is remedied within 
five (5) Business Days or the following Purchase Date); or 
(vi) 
an Event of Replacement of the Servicer occurs; or 
(vii) 
a Swap Counterparty Downgrade Event occurs and none of the remedies provided for in the 
Interest Rate Swap Agreement are put in place within the term required thereunder; 
(viii) a Clean-Up Call Event occurs; or 
(ix) 
an exercise of a Seller’s Call option. 
For the purposes of this section: 


 
 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Securities Note 
 
 
85 
 
“Cumulative Loss Ratio” means, as of the Determination Date immediately preceding any 
Payment Date, the ratio between: 
(i) 
the aggregate Defaulted Amount of all Receivables that have become Defaulted 
Receivables between the Date of Incorporation until the end of the corresponding 
Determination Period, reduced by the amount of Principal Recoveries received during 
such period in respect of such Receivables; and 
(ii) 
the sum of (a) the Outstanding Balance of the Receivables as of the Date of 
Incorporation and (b) the Outstanding Balance of all the Additional Receivables on the 
date of their respective assignment. 
For the avoidance of doubt, for the purpose of calculating the numerator of the above ratio, the 
Defaulted Amount of each Defaulted Receivable shall be taken as at the last day of the 
Determination Period during which the relevant Receivable became a Defaulted Receivable. 
“Insolvency Event” means, with respect to any person or entity: 
(i) 
the declaration of insolvency (declaración de concurso), including the filing of any request

elapsed; 
(iii) 
any event with respect to itself which, under the applicable laws of any jurisdiction, has an 
analogous effect to any of the events specified in the paragraphs above; 
(iv) 
such person or entity being unable or admitting its inability to pay its debts as they fall due; 
(v) 
such person or entity being deemed, or being declared by a court of competent jurisdiction, 
to be insolvent or unable to pay its debts as they fall due under Spanish law; or 
(vi) 
such person or entity suspending or threatening (by way of written notice) to suspend 
making payments on its debts as a whole generally as they fall due. 
Early Redemption of all the Notes issued. 
Upon the occurrence of any of the events set forth in section 4.4.3 of the Registration Document 
the Management Company shall carry out the Early Liquidation of the Fund and, thus, the Early 
Redemption of all Notes issued, and distribute the Available Funds in accordance with the Post-
Enforcement Priority of Payments set out in section 3.4.7.3 of the Additional Information. 
In case of Early Redemption of the Notes pursuant to section 4.4.3 of the Registration Document:

4.9.2.2. 
Legal Maturity Date 
The Legal Maturity Date of the Fund and consequently the final redemption of the Notes is 20 
September 2038 (subject to the Modified Following Business Day Convention). Final redemption 
of the Notes on the Legal Maturity Date shall be made subject to the Post-Enforcement Priority of 
Payments set forth in in section 3.4.7.3 of the Additional Information. 
4.9.2.3. 
Optional redemption upon the occurrence of a Regulatory Call Event 
The Seller will have the right (but not the obligation) to request the Management Company to 
redeem on any Payment Date following the occurrence of a Regulatory Call Event all of the Class 
B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes (while the 
Class A Notes and the Cash Reserve shall not be redeemed) if a Regulatory Call Event (as this 
term is defined below) occurs, in accordance with the Regulatory Call Priority of Payments set 
forth in section 3.4.7.2.3(B) of the Additional Information. 
In order for the Seller to exercise its right upon the occurrence of a Regulatory Call Event, the 
Seller and the Management Company shall take the following actions: 
(i) 
the Seller shall provide with written notice to the Management Company communicating 
the occurrence of a Regulatory Call Event and requesting the Management Company to 
redeem the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the 
Class F Notes; and 
(ii) 
the Management Company shall then inform the Rating Agencies in accordance with 
section 4 of the Additional Information, and the Noteholders with no less than thirty (30) 
days’ prior written notice by publishing the appropriate material event (información 
relevante) with the CNMV (the “Regulatory Redemption Notice”) (the “Regulatory Call 
Early Redemption Date”). 
On or before the Regulatory Redemption Notice is published, the Management Company shall 
notify the Noteholders that: 
(i) 
the Regulatory Call Event is continuing and cannot be avoided by taking reasonable 
measures; and 
(ii) 
the Fund shall have the necessary funds on such Payment Date to discharge its outstanding 
liabilities in respect of all the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the 
Class E Notes and the Class F Notes in full after making the payments ranking in priority to 


 
 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Securities Note 
 
 
87 
 
or pari passu therewith, in accordance with the Pre-Enforcement Priority of Payments set 
out in section 3.4.7.2 of the Additional Information. 
“Regulatory Call Event” means: 
(i) 
any enactment or implementation of, or supplement or amendment to, or change in any 
applicable law, policy, rule, guideline or regulation of any competent international, 
European or national body (including the European Central Bank, the Prudential Regulation 
Authority or any other competent international, European or national regulatory or 
supervisory authority) or the application or official interpretation of, or view expressed by 
any such competent body with respect to, any such law, regulation, rule, policy or 
guideline; or 
(ii) 
a notification by or other communication from an applicable regulatory or supervisory 
authority is received by the Seller with respect to the transactions contemplated by the 
Transaction Documents, 
which, in either case, occurs on or after the Date of Incorporation and results in, or would in the 
reasonable opinion of the Seller result in, a material adverse change in the rate of return on capital 
of the Fund and/or the Seller or materially increasing the cost or materially reducing the benefit for 
the Seller of the transactions contemplated in the Transaction Documents. 
For clarification purposes, the declaration of a Regulatory Call Event will not be prevented by the 
fact that, prior to the Date of Incorporation, the event constituting such Regulatory Call Event was: 
(i) 
announced or contained in any proposal (whether in draft or final form) for a change in the 
laws, regulations, applicable regulatory rules, policies or guidelines (including any accord, 
standard, or recommendation of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision), as 
officially interpreted, implemented or applied by the European Central Bank, the Prudential 
Regulation Authority or the European Union; or 
(ii) 
incorporated in any law or regulation approved and/or published but the effectiveness or 
application of which is deferred, in whole or in part, beyond the Date of Incorporation, 
provided that the application of the EU Securitisation Regulation and the applicable 
legislation shall not constitute a Regulatory Call Event, but without prejudice to the ability 
of a Regulatory Call Event to occur as a result of any implementing regulations, policies or 
guidelines in respect thereof announced or published after the Date of Incorporation; or 
(iii) 
express in any statement by an official of the competent authority in expert meetings or 
other discussions in connection with such Regulatory Call Event (but without receipt of an 
official interpretation or other official communication); or 
(iv) 
the competent authority has issued any notification, taken any decision or expressed any 
view with respect to any individual transaction, other than the transaction. Accordingly, 
such proposals, statements, notifications or views will not be considered when assessing the 
rate of return on capital of the Fund and/or Seller or an increase of the cost or reduction of 
benefits to the Seller of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents 
immediately after the Date of Incorporation. 
The total amount to be advanced by the Seller to the Fund under the Seller Loan (the “Seller Loan 
Advance Amount”) on the relevant Payment Date shall be equal to: 
(i) 
in respect of principal: 


 
 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Securities Note 
 
 
88 
 
(a) 
the aggregate Outstanding Balance of the Receivables at the end of the immediately 
preceding Determination Period (other than in respect of the Defaulted Receivables 
or Delinquent Receivables); plus 
(b) 
the outstanding credit balance of the Cash Reserve; plus 
(c) 
the aggregate Final Determined Amount of the Defaulted Receivables and 
Delinquent Receivables; minus 
(d) 
the Principal Amount Outstanding of the Class A Notes, after giving effect to the 
redemptions due on such Payment Date; 
(ii) 
In respect of interest, any interest on the Receivables (other than Defaulted Receivables or 
Delinquent Receivables) accrued until, and outstanding on, the Regulatory Call Early 
Redemption Date. 
The Fund shall obtain the Seller Loan Advance Amount from a Seller Loan that the Seller shall 
advance to the Fund for an amount equal to the Seller Loan Advance Amount. The Seller Loan 
Advance Amount shall form part of the Available Funds and applied in accordance with the 
Regulatory Call Priority of Payments contemplated in section 3.4.7.2.3(B) of the Additional 
Information. 
Following the Regulatory Call Early Redemption Date, the relevant parties to the Transaction 
Documents have agreed to promptly execute and deliver all instruments, notices and documents 
and take all further action that the Issuer or the Seller may reasonably request including, without 
limitation, agreeing all necessary modifications, waivers and additions to the Transaction 
Documents required provided that no such modifications, waivers and additions are materially 
prejudicial to the interests of the holders of the Class A Notes then outstanding. 
For the avoidance of doubt, if the Seller exercises its right upon the occurrence of a Regulatory 
Call Event, a Seller Loan shall be granted by the Seller and all of the Class B Notes, the Class C 
Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes shall each be redeemed in full 
(in whole but not in part) with the proceeds received from such Seller Loan, while the Class A 
Notes and the Cash Reserve shall not be redeemed. The Class A Notes shall benefit from 
subordination of the Seller Loan instead of the redeemed Classes of Notes, and from the 
collateralisation of all Receivables which prior to the Regulatory Call Event backed all Classes of 
Notes. 
Under this circumstance, the Fund will continue to exist until its cancellation pursuant to section 
4.4.4. of the Registration Document or the Early Liquidation of the Fund pursuant to section 4.4.3 
of the Registration Document. 
4.10. 
Indication of investor yield and calculation method 
The average yield, duration and final maturity of the Notes depend on several factors, of which the 
most significant are the following: 
(i) 
The repayment schedule for each of the Loans established in the corresponding Loan 
Agreements. 
(ii) 
The ability of the Borrowers to totally or partially early repay the Loans and the speed with 
which this early repayment takes place during the life of the Fund. Thus, the early 
repayment of the Loans by the Borrowers, subject to ongoing changes, and estimated in this 


 
 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Securities Note 
 
 
89 
 
Prospectus through several assumptions regarding the behaviour of the future CPR, which 
will directly influence the speed of the redemption of the Notes, and, therefore, the average 
life and duration of the Notes. 
(iii) 
The interest rates applicable to the Loans. 
(iv) 
A payment default by the Borrowers regarding payment of the Loan instalments. 
In order to calculate the tables included in this section, the following hypothetical values and 
circumstances, taking into consideration the Initial Receivables, have been assumed for the factors 
described: 
(i) 
Regarding the Receivables: 
(a) 
each of the Receivables complies with the statements provided in section 2.2.8.(ii) 
of the Additional Information; 
(b) 
no Receivable will be substituted by the Seller in accordance with section 2.2.9 of 
the Additional Information; 
(c) 
during the Revolving Period, all Receivables comply with the Individual and Global 
Eligibility Criteria; 
(d) 
the weighted average interest rate of the Receivables is 6.78% (weighted average 
interest rate of the Preliminary Portfolio); and 
(e) 
an annual constant default rate (CDR) of 1.40%, with an average recovery rate of 
59.39% at twenty-four (24) months. The recovery rate is the proportion of the 
Outstanding Balance of the Defaulted Receivables recovered after twenty-four (24) 
months. The CDR and the recovery rate are consistent with the rates of SCF 
portfolio of equivalent auto loans and with the delinquency data in the charts 
included in sections 1.1.1 of the Risk Factors and 2.2.7.5 of the Additional 
Information. For the purposes of this Prospectus, such portfolio takes into account 
the relevant proportion of New Vehicles and Used Vehicles and is selected by 
equivalent loans that comply with the following criteria: (i) each and every Loan has 
a maximum Regulatory PD of 6%, and (ii) no Loan is derived from a Refinancing or 
Restructuring. The aforementioned CDR corresponds to a net cumulative loss rate at 
maturity of 1.71% in the 6.5% CPR scenario; 
(ii) 
the disbursement of the Notes takes place on the Disbursement Date; 
(iii) 
the CPRs (5.0%, 6.5% and 8.0%) hold constant over the life of the Notes, the CPRs are 
consistent with respect the information with the CPR data of a similar portfolio to the 
Preliminary Portfolio; 
(iv) 
the weighted average coupon of the Floating Rate Notes on the Disbursement Date is equal 
to 3.20% (under the assumption that EURIBOR 3 months was 1.732% on 4 November 
2022) and the weighted average margin of the Floating Rate Notes is 1.47%; 
(v) 
the Subordinated Loan is repaid on the First Payment Date and the interest rate applicable 
will be equal to EURIBOR 3 months (as this is defined in section 3.4.4.1 of the Additional 
Information) plus a margin of 3.36% (assuming that EURIBOR 3 months was 1.732% on 4 
November 2022);

(vi) 
no interest is received in respect of the accounts on behalf of the Fund and no negative 
interest is charged; 
(vii) 
estimated annual Ordinary Expenses of the Fund: annual rate of 0.152% on the Outstanding 
Balance of the Receivables, which, during the first year, will correspond to an amount 
equivalent to ONE MILLION SIXTY-THREE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY-
FIVE EUROS (€1,063,465); 
(viii) the first interest payment date under the Notes is the First Payment Date; 
(ix) 
no Subordination Event occurs (except for the Clean-Up Call Event); 
(x) 
there is no Early Liquidation of the Fund by application of a Tax Call Event or Regulatory 
Call Event but there is an Early Liquidation of the Fund on the Payment Date immediately 
following the first occurrence of a Clean-up Call Event; 
(xi) 
the first Payment Date on which the principal of the Floating Rate Notes is repaid will be 
the Payment Date falling on March 2024; 
(xii) 
The Fund will acquire Additional Receivables during the Revolving Period in accordance 
with section 2.2.2.4 of the Additional Information; 
(xiii) for the purposes of calculating IRR under the Notes, the subscription price of the Class A 
Notes to the Class E Notes is 100% of their nominal amount and the subscription price of 
Class F Notes is 97.98% of their nominal amount. 
(xiv) no Class E and Class F Notes Interest Deferral Trigger has occurred; and 
(xv) 
the Principal Account is not funded. 
The hypothesis (i)(e) and (iii) are derived from the historical information provided by the Seller 
and are reasonable for the portfolio of Receivables. 
If we assume that the Management Company, acting on behalf of the Fund, proceeds to the Early 
Liquidation of the Fund, following the instructions of the Seller, on the first Payment Date after 
the Outstanding Balance of the Receivables falls below 10% of the Outstanding Balance of the 
Receivables on the Date of Incorporation as established by section 4.4.3.2. of the Registration 
Document, the weighted average life, maturity and IRR of the Notes would be the following 
assuming a CPR of 5.0%, 6.5% and 8.0%, respectively:

The Management Company states that the information in the tables included below is for 
informative purposes only and that the amounts reflected therein do not represent a specific 
payment obligation to third parties by the Fund in the referred dates or periods. The data included 
in the tables below has been prepared under the assumption of a repayment rate of the Loans on a 
constant basis among the duration of the Fund, subject to constant changes. 
The average life of each class of the Notes are subject to factors largely outside the control of the 
Fund and consequently no assurance can be given that the assumptions and the estimates above 
will prove in any way to be realistic and they must therefore be viewed with considerable caution. 
Set forth below are the tables showing the debt service for each Class of Notes assuming a CPR of 
6.5%, which is consistent with the Cash Flow Model provided by INTEX. Tables for different 
scenarios are not included, given that differences in average life are not significant.

4.13.2. 
MIFID II/MIFIR and PRIIPS 
The new regulatory framework established by Directive 2014/65/UE of the European Parliament 
and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments and amending Directive 
2002/92/EC and Directive 2011/61/EU (as amended, “MIFID II”) and by Regulation 
600/2013/UE of the European Parliament and of Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial 
instruments and amending Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 (as amended, “MIFIR”) has been 
mainly implemented in Spain through Royal Decree 14/2018, of 28 September and Royal Decree 
1464/2018, of 21 December. The potential investors in the Notes must carry out their own analysis 
on the risks and costs which MIFID II/MIFIR or their future technical standards may entail for the 
investment in Notes. 
Therefore, the Notes shall not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in 
the European Economic Area (“EEA”). For these purposes, a “retail investor” means a person 
who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of article 4(1) of MIFID II; or (ii) 
a customer within the meaning of Directive 2002/92/EC, where that customer would not qualify as 
a professional client as defined in point (10) of article 4(1) of MIFID II or (iii) not a qualified 
investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently, no key information document 
(KID) required by Regulation (EU) No 1286 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 
November 2014 on key information documents for package retail and insurance-based investment 
products (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise 
making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or 
selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be 
unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. 
For the above purposes, the term “offer” includes communication in any form and by any means, 
of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and on the Notes offered such as enables an 
investor to decide whether to purchase or subscribe for the Notes. 
By subscribing the Notes, each Noteholder agrees to the terms of the Deed of Incorporation and 
this Prospectus. 
4.13.3. 
UK MIFIR and UK PRIIPS 
The potential investors in the Notes must carry out their own analysis on the risks and costs which 
UK MiFIR or their future technical standards may imply for the investment in Notes.  
The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be 
offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (“UK”). 
For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as 
defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of the domestic 
law of the United Kingdom by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended, 
“EUWA”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the Financial Services and 
Markets Act 2000 (as amended, “FSMA”) and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to 
implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, 
as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of the 
domestic law of the United Kingdom by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified investor as 
defined in Article 2 of the Prospectus Regulation as it forms part of the domestic law of the United 
Kingdom by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently, no key information document required by 
Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of the domestic law of the United Kingdom by 
virtue of the EUWA (as amended, the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes 
or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore

offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK 
may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and on the Notes offered such as enables an 
investor to decide whether to purchase or subscribe for the Notes.

7.3.1. 
Ratings 
On 4 November 2022, the Notes included in this Securities Note were given the following 
provisional ratings by the Rating Agencies (as of the date of registration of this Prospectus, no 
notification has been received from the Rating Agencies modifying such provisional ratings): 
 
Moody’s 
Fitch 
Class A Notes 
(P) Aa1 
AA (EXP) sf 
Class B Notes 
(P) Aa2

Class F Notes

A failure by the Rating Agencies to confirm any of the provisional ratings (unless they are 
upgraded) before the end of the disbursement of the Notes will be immediately reported to the 
CNMV and made public as provided in section 4 of the Additional Information. This circumstance 
will result in termination of the incorporation of the Fund, the Notes issued, all agreements (except 
for the Subordinated Loan Agreement in relation to the expenses for the incorporation of the Fund 
and the issue of the Notes), and the assignment of the Receivables. 
7.3.2. 
Ratings considerations 
The meaning of the ratings assigned to the Rated Notes by the Rating Agencies can be reviewed at 
those Rating Agencies’ websites:  
(i) 
www.moodys.com; and 
(ii) www.fitchratings.com. 
The ratings assigned by the Rating Agencies do not constitute an evaluation of the likelihood of 
Borrowers prepaying principal, nor indeed of the extent to which such payments differ from what 
was originally forecasted and should not prevent potential investors from conducting their own 
analysis of the Notes to be acquired. The ratings are not by any means a rating of the level of 
actuarial performance. 
The abovementioned credit ratings are intended purely as an opinion and should not prevent 
potential investors from conducting their own analyses of the securities to be acquired. 
The Rating Agencies may revise, suspend or withdraw the final ratings assigned at any time, based 
on any information that may come to their notice. Those events, which shall not constitute early 
liquidation events of the Fund, shall forthwith be notified to both the CNMV and the Noteholders, 
in accordance with the provisions of section 4.1 of the Additional Information.

7.3.2.1. 
Registration of Rating Agencies 
(i) 
On 31 October 2011, Moody’s was registered and authorised by the ESMA as European 
Union Credit Rating Agencies in accordance with the provisions of the CRA Regulation. 
(ii) 
On 31 October 2011, Fitch was registered and authorised by the ESMA as European Union 
Credit Rating Agencies in accordance with the provisions of the CRA Regulation. 
7.3.2.2. 
Description of each Rating Agency ratings 
7.3.2.2.1 
Moody’s 
Moody’s Global Long-Term Rating Scale appends numerical modifiers 1, 2, and 3 to each generic 
rating classification from Aa through Caa. The modifier 1 indicates that the obligation ranks in the 
higher end of its generic rating category; the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the 
modifier 3 indicates a ranking in the lower end of that generic rating category. 
(i) 
Aaa (sf): Obligations rated Aaa are judged to be of the highest quality, subject to the lowest 
level of credit risk. 
(ii) 
Aa (sf): Obligations rated Aa are judged to be of high quality and are subject to very low 
credit risk. 
(iii) 
A (sf): Obligations rated A are judged to be upper-medium grade and are subject to low 
credit risk. 
(iv) 
Baa (sf): Obligations rated Baa are judged to be medium-grade and subject to moderate 
credit risk and as such may possess certain speculative characteristics. 
(v) 
Ba (sf): Obligations rated Ba are judged to be speculative and are subject to substantial 
credit risk. 
(vi) 
B (sf): Obligations rated B are considered speculative and are subject to high credit risk. 
(vii) 
Caa (sf): Obligations rated Caa are judged to be speculative of poor standing and are 
subject to very high credit risk. 
(viii) Ca (sf): Obligations rated Ca are highly speculative and are likely in, or very near, default, 
with some prospect of recovery of principal and interest. 
(ix) 
C (sf): Obligations rated C are the lowest rated and are typically in default, with little 
prospect for recovery of principal or interest. 
Moody’s will often assign a provisional rating to an issuer or an instrument when the change to a 
definitive rating is subject to the fulfilment of contingencies that could affect the rating. Examples 
of such contingencies are the finalisation of transaction documents/terms where a rating is 
sensitive to changes at closing. When such contingencies are not present, a definitive rating may 
be assigned based upon documentation that is not yet in final form. Moody’s will also often assign 
provisional ratings to program ratings, such as shelf registrations and medium term note programs. 
A provisional rating is denoted by placing a (P) in front of the rating. The (P) notation provides 
additional information about the rating, but does not indicate a different rating. For example, a 
provisional rating of (P)Aa1 is the same rating as Aa1. 
For provisional ratings assigned to an issuer or instrument, the (P) notation is removed when the 
applicable contingencies have been fulfilled.

Fitch 
Fitch’s Ratings of structured finance obligations on the long-term scale consider the obligations’ 
relative vulnerability to default. These ratings are typically assigned to an individual security or 
tranche in a transaction and not to an issuer. 
(i) 
AAA (sf): Highest Credit Quality. ‘AAA’ ratings denote the lowest expectation of default 
risk. They are assigned only in cases of exceptionally strong capacity for payment of 
financial commitments. This capacity is highly unlikely to be adversely affected by 
foreseeable events. 
(ii) 
AA (sf): Very High Credit Quality. ‘AA’ ratings denote expectations of very low default 
risk. They indicate very strong capacity for payment of financial commitments. This 
capacity is not significantly vulnerable to foreseeable events. 
(iii) 
A (sf): High Credit Quality. ‘A’ ratings denote expectations of low default risk. The 
capacity for payment of financial commitments is considered strong. This capacity may, 
nevertheless, be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic conditions than is the 
case for higher ratings. 
(iv) 
BBB (sf): Good Credit Quality. ‘BBB’ ratings indicate that expectations of default risk are 
currently low. The capacity for payment of financial commitments is considered adequate, 
but adverse business or economic conditions are more likely to impair this capacity. 
(v) 
BB (sf): Speculative. ‘BB’ ratings indicate an elevated vulnerability to default risk, 
particularly in the event of adverse changes in business or economic conditions over time. 
(vi) 
B (sf): Highly Speculative. ‘B’ ratings indicate that material default risk is present, but a 
limited margin of safety remains. Financial commitments are currently being met; 
however, capacity for continued payment is vulnerable to deterioration in the business and 
economic environment. 
Within rating categories, Fitch may use modifiers. The modifiers "+" or "-" may be appended to a 
rating to denote relative status within major rating categories. Such suffixes are not added to 
‘AAA’ ratings and ratings below the ‘CCC’ category. 
Where a rating is referred to as “expected,” alternatively referred to as “expects to rate,” it will 
have a suffix as (EXP). This indicates that the assigned rating may be sensitive to (i) finalisation of 
the terms in the draft documents or (ii) fulfilment of other contingencies at closing. For example, 
expected ratings can be assigned based on the agency’s expectations regarding final 
documentation, typically based on a review of the draft documentation provided by the issuer. 
When final documentation is received, the (EXP) suffix typically will be removed and the rating 
updated if necessary. 
 
7.3.2.3. 
Final rating considerations 
The Rating Agencies differentiates structured finance ratings from fundamental ratings (i.e., 
ratings on non-financial corporate, financial institution, and public sector entities) on the long 
term scale by adding the suffix (sf) to the structured finance ratings.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO BE INCLUDED IN RELATION TO ASSET-BACKED 
SECURITIES 
(Annex 19 of the Prospectus Delegated Regulation) 
1. 
THE SECURITIES 
1.1. 
A statement that a notification has been, or is intended to be communicated to ESMA, as 
regards simple, transparent and standardised securitisation (‘STS’) compliance, where 
applicable 
The securitisation transaction described in this Prospectus is intended to qualify as a simple, 
transparent and standardised securitisation (STS securitisation) within the meaning of article 18 of 
the EU Securitisation Regulation. Consequently, on or about the Date of Incorporation (and in any 
case within fifteen (15) calendar days from the Date of Incorporation), SCF, as Originator, will 
submit an STS notification to ESMA in accordance with article 27 of the EU Securitisation 
Regulation (the “STS Notification”), pursuant to which compliance with the requirements of 
articles 19 to 22 of the EU Securitisation Regulation shall be notified to the ESMA register of STS 
notifications in order to request that the securitisation transaction described in this Prospectus is 
included in the ESMA register of STS notifications for the purposes of article 27(5) of the EU 
Securitisation 
Regulation 
(https://www.esma.europa.eu/policy-activities/securitisation/simple-
transparent-and-standardised-sts-securitisation).  
The Management Company, by virtue of a delegation by the Seller shall notify the CNMV -in its 
capacity as competent authority- of the submission of such mandatory STS Notification to ESMA, 
attaching such notification. 
1.2. 
STS compliance 
None of the Management Company, on behalf of the Fund, the Seller, the Arranger, the Lead 
Manager or any other party to the Transaction Documents gives any explicit or implied 
representation or warranty as to (i) the inclusion of this securitisation transaction in the list 
administered by ESMA within the meaning of article 27(5) of the EU Securitisation Regulation, 
and (ii) whether this securitisation transaction shall be recognised or designated as “STS” or 
“simple, transparent and standardised” within the meaning of article 18 of the EU Securitisation 
Regulation after the date of notification to ESMA. 
The status of the STS Notification is not static and investors should conduct their own research 
regarding 
the 
status 
of 
the 
STS 
Notification 
on 
the 
ESMA 
website 
(https://www.esma.europa.eu/policy-activities/securitisation/simple-transparent-and-standardised-
sts-securitisation). 
The Seller, as originator, shall be responsible for the fulfilment of the requirements of articles 19 to 
22 of the EU Securitisation Regulation and shall immediately notify ESMA and inform its 
competent authority (when duly appointed) when the transaction no longer meets the requirements 
of articles 19 to 22 of the EU Securitisation Regulation. 
1.3. 
Third-Party Verification 
The Seller, as originator, has used the services of PCS, as a Third Party Verification Agent (STS) 
in connection with an assessment of the compliance with the requirements of articles 19 to 22 of 


 
 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Additional Information 
 
 
105 
 
the EU Securitisation Regulation (the “STS Verification”). It is expected that the STS Verification 
prepared by PCS (i) will be issued on or prior to the Disbursement Date, and (ii) will be available 
for investors on the PCS website (https://www.pcsmarket.org/sts-verification-transactions/) 
together with a detailed explanation of its scope at https://www.PCSmarket.org/disclaimer. 
The STS Verification is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, is not investment 
advice whether generally or as defined under MiFID II and is not a credit rating whether generally 
or as defined under the CRA Regulation or Section 3(a) of the United States Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934 (as amended). PCS is not an “expert” as defined in the Securities Act. 
There can be no assurance that the securitisation transaction described in this Prospectus will 
receive the STS Verification by PCS and if the securitisation transaction described in this 
Prospectus does not receive the STS Verification, this shall not, under any circumstances, affect 
the liability of the Originator and the Fund in respect of its legal obligations under the EU 
Securitisation Regulation, nor shall it affect the obligations imposed on institutional investors as 
set out in article 5 of the EU Securitisation Regulation. Having said that, since PCS has prepared 
draft versions of the STS Verification during the process leading to registration of this Prospectus, 
it is expected that the final STS Verification will be positive. Investors should conduct their own 
research regarding the nature of the STS Verification and must read the information available in 
http://pcsmarket.org. In the provision of STS Verification, PCS bases its decision on information 
provided directly and indirectly by the Originator. For the avoidance of doubt, the PCS website 
and the contents thereof do not form part of this Prospectus. 
Finally, it should be noted that none of the Seller (as originator) or the Fund (as SSPE) under the 
UK Securitisation Regulation are actively seeking to comply with the requirements of the UK 
Securitisation Regulation. UK investors should be aware of this and should note that their 
regulatory position may be affected. The Transaction will not be a UK STS Transaction and will 
therefore not be notified to the UK Financial Conduct Authority for that purpose. 
1.4. 
The minimum denomination of an issue 
The Fund, which is represented by the Management Company, will be incorporated with the Initial 
Receivables that SCF will assign to the Fund on the Date of Incorporation, the principal amount of 
which will be equal to or slightly higher than SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION EUROS 
(€700,000,000), amount which is equal to the Principal Amount Outstanding of the Class A Notes, 
the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, and the Class E Notes as of the Date of 
Incorporation. 
The Fund shall issue the Class F Notes with an aggregate face value of SEVEN MILLION 
EUROS (€7,000,000), which shall be used to fund the Cash Reserve, which will be deposited in 
the Treasury Account. 
1.5. 
Confirmation that the information relating to an undertaking/obligor not involved in the 
issue has been accurately reproduced from the information published by the 
undertaking/obligor 
Not applicable.

2. 
THE UNDERLYING ASSETS 
2.1. 
Confirmation that the securitised assets backing the issue have characteristics that 
demonstrate the capacity to produce funds to service any payments due and payable on the 
securities 
The Originator confirms that the flows of principal, ordinary interest and any other amounts 
generated by the Receivables are sufficient to meet the payments due and payable under the Notes 
in accordance with the contractual nature thereof. 
However, in order to cover any eventual payment defaults of the Borrowers, credit enhancements 
will be put in place in order to increase the security or regularity of the payments of the Notes, and 
which are described in section 3.4.2 of this Additional Information. Such credit enhancements, 
however, may prove to be insufficient in exceptional circumstances. 
Not all the Notes issued have the same risk of default. 
2.2. 
Assets backing the issue 
The Fund will pool in its assets the Receivables arising from Loans granted by SCF to Borrowers, 
who are individuals and legal persons’ who were resident or registered, as applicable, in Spain as 
of the date of formalisation of each Loan, for the financing of the acquisition of New Vehicles or 
Used Vehicles, which have been granted pursuant to Law 16/2011, of 24 June, on consumer credit 
agreements (as amended, “Law 16/2011”) (and, with respect to the Additional Receivables, 
pursuant to the foregoing aforementioned law and/or any other relevant regulations applicable 
from time to time). 
The characteristic and requirements to be met by the Receivables to be assigned to the Fund are 
described in the sections below and in accordance with the provisions of the Deed of 
Incorporation. 
Reservation of title to the vehicles 
All Loan Agreements from which the Receivables included in the Preliminary Portfolio derive 
have a reservation of title clause notarised in a deed (póliza) granted before a public notary or in a 
private agreement in an official form. 
The inclusion of a reservation of title clause would grant the Seller, as creditor, a right of 
ownership (dominio) over the vehicle financed under the Loan until such Loan is repaid in full. 
Once the Borrower has fulfilled all the obligations arising from the relevant Loan, the Borrower 
shall forthwith acquire full legal and beneficial title to the relevant vehicle. 
In order for reservation of title clauses to be enforceable vis-à-vis third parties, it will be necessary 
to register them in the Register of Instalment Sales of Movable Properties (Registro de Venta a 
Plazos de Bienes Muebles). 
As provided in section 2.2.2.3(vi) (b), the reservation of title has only been registered with the 
Register of Instalment Sales of Movable Properties with respect to 12.44% of the Loans which 
represents 21.80% of the Outstanding Balance of the Receivables arising in the Preliminary 
Portfolio. Notwithstanding the above, in case there is any irregularity detected by the CBU and/or 
when the ODU analyst deems appropriate, the reservation of title will be formalised so that they 
can be registered with Register of Instalment Sales of Movable Properties. 


 
 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Additional Information 
 
 
107 
 
The Register of Instalment Sales of Movable Properties notifies on a daily basis the registration of 
such reservation of title to the Vehicles Register of the Spanish General Traffic Directorate 
(Registro de Vehículos de la Dirección General de Tráfico), which has a purely administrative 
nature, where they also become registered. 
Non-registration of a reservation of title clause involves that the Loan Agreement shall exclusively 
have inter-partes effects (i.e., it would be unenforceable against third party purchasers in good 
faith, who would be considered as having validly acquired the Vehicle affected by the reservation 
of title clause, without prejudice to Seller’s right to claim damages against the Borrower arising 
from the latter's failure to abide by the non-disposal covenant). 
The reservation of title may be formalised in a private document by means of an official form, or 
as a deed (póliza) granted before a public notary, and its registration in the Register of Instalment 
Sales of Movable Properties is optional. 
Any reservations of title documented by virtue of a deed (póliza) granted before a public notary or 
by means of an official form, registered in the corresponding Register of Instalment Sales of 
Movable Properties, grant their beneficiary, as provided in article 16.5 of Law 28/1998, the 
preference and priority set forth in article 1,922.2 of the Civil Code and article 1,926.1 of the Civil 
Code, i.e., if two or more credits compete with respect to certain movable properties, and as 
regards the order of priority for their payment, the secured credit excludes the rest of credits up to 
the value of the item pledged as a security. The specifics of this issue are further described in 
section 3.4.6.1(iii) (“Special consideration relation to the reservation of title”) of the Additional 
Information. 
In the event that the Loan Agreement is formalised as a deed (póliza) granted before a public 
notary, in accordance with sections 4 and 5 of article 517 of the Spanish Civil Procedure Law, and 
registered with the Register of Instalment Sales of Movable Properties, the recovery procedure is 
made through a public notary, as described in section 3.4.6.1 (iii) (“Special consideration relation 
to the reservation of title”) of the Additional Information. 
Consumer Protection Law and linked contracts under the Law 16/2011 
The Fund may be exposed to credit risk in relation to individual Borrowers, who are individuals 
acting as consumers for non-business purposes and who have entered into the Loan Agreements. 
Individual Borrowers benefit from the protective provisions of Royal Legislative Decree 1/2007, 
of November 16, approving the consolidated text of the General Law for the Defence of 
Consumers and Users and other complementary laws (Real Decreto Legislativo 1/2007, de 16 de 
noviembre, por el que se aprueba el texto refundido de la Ley General para la Defensa de los 
Consumidores y Usuarios y otras leyes complementarias) (as amended, the “Consumer 
Protection Law”) and Law 16/2011, of June 24, on consumer credit agreements (Ley 16/2011, de 
24 de junio, de contratos de crédito al consumo) (as amended, “Law 16/2011”). 
If a Loan Agreement is entered into with a consumer within the meaning of article 3 of the 
Consumer Protection Law and/or article 2 of the Law 16/2011 there is also a risk that the 
provisions on consumers' rights and linked contracts may apply to the Loan Agreement. 
In addition, there is an increasing tendency in recent years for Spanish borrowers to file claims 
against financial institutions, including allegations that certain provisions included in the 


 
 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Additional Information 
 
 
108 
 
agreements entered into between such financial institutions and the consumers are unfair 
(abusivas) and therefore null and void. 
In addition, there is a strong trend in Spanish case law that leans towards declaring the unfairness 
of many standard clauses regularly used by financial institutions in the consumer financing market. 
Such case law is not static and has changed over time in certain instances as a consequence of new 
legal developments and/or the change of position of higher courts; this, in some instances, has led 
to a variety of different decisions by courts on similar issues from time to time and, ultimately, 
uncertainty amongst lower courts, borrowers and lenders on the outcome of the disputes. 
In relation to the above, the main consequence of a clause in a consumer loan being declared unfair 
by a court is that such clause will be considered null and void. In practice, this implies that the loan 
agreement will have to be interpreted as if the clause had never been in the loan agreement, whilst 
the rest of the clauses in the loan agreement will remain binding for the parties, provided the loan 
agreement can survive without the unfair clause. 
In case of enforcement, if the court assesses the existence of any unfair clause in the loan 
agreement, the judge will: (i) declare the inadmissibility of the enforcement (if the nullity of the 
clause precludes the enforcement) or (ii) accept enforcement omitting the application of the unfair 
clause (if the absence of such clause does not preclude the lender initiating enforcement 
proceedings). 
Clauses under challenge can be divided into two main groups: 
(a) 
clauses with financial content; and 
(b) 
clauses that trigger an event of default and early termination events. 
Challenges on clauses with financial content generally affect the loan's ability to generate income 
(or the amount thereof), whilst clauses governing events of default and early termination clauses 
are likely to affect the lender's ability to accelerate the loan and recover amounts due through a 
specific foreclosure or enforcement proceedings. 
If a clause generating income for the Fund is declared null and void, the Fund will no longer be 
allowed to apply such clause and it will be required to return to the borrower all amounts unduly 
collected by the Fund as a result of application of such clause with financial content. 
On the other hand, if a clause triggering an event of default or early termination is declared null 
and void, the Fund will forego (or limit) its rights to access foreclosure or enforcement proceeding. 
Thus, there exists a risk that, should a claim alleging the abusiveness of any of these clauses be 
made, they end up being declared unfair by the Spanish courts. 
Any Spanish court judgment declaring the unfairness of a clause of a loan may instigate other 
borrowers in similar contracts to initiate claims based on similar grounds. 
This could create potential liabilities and, eventually, affect the Fund's ability to generate income, 
which in turn, if subject to mass litigation, could have a material adverse effect on the Fund's 
business and financial condition. 
Maximum Receivables Amount

The maximum amount of the Outstanding Balance of the Receivables pooled in the Fund on the 
Date of Incorporation will be equal to or slightly higher than SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION 
EUROS (€700,000,000) (the “Maximum Receivables Amount”), amount which is equal to the 
Principal Amount Outstanding of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the 
Class D Notes, and the Class E Notes as of the Date of Incorporation. 
2.2.1. 
Legal jurisdiction by which the pool of assets is governed 
The Loans and the Receivables are governed by Spanish law. In particular, the securitised 
Receivables are governed by the Spanish banking regulations and, specifically and where 
applicable, by: 
(i) 
Law 16/2011 (and regarding the Additional Receivables, Law 16/2011 or any other relevant 
regulations applicable from time to time); 
(ii) 
Circular 8/1990 of Bank of Spain, of 7 September, on transparency of transactions and 
protection of customers; 
(iii) 
Order EHA/2899/2011, of 28 October, on transparency and protection for customers of 
banking services; 
(iv) 
Circular 5/2012, of 27 June, of Bank of Spain, for credit entities and providers of payment 
services, on transparency of banking services and responsible granting of loans, where 
applicable;

2.2.2.1. 
Assignment 
The total Outstanding Balance of the Initial Receivables to be assigned by SCF to the Fund on the 
Date of Incorporation (the “Initial Receivables”) will be equal to the Maximum Receivables 
Amount, i.e., SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION EUROS (€700,000,000) or an amount slightly 
greater but as close as possible to that amount. The assignment of the Initial Receivables to the 
Fund will have effect from the Date of Incorporation and will be documented by means of the Sale 
and Purchase Agreement (which will include a list of the Initial Receivables assigned to the Fund). 
Any Receivables (either the Initial Receivables or the Additional Receivables) to be offered by the 
Seller to the Fund will be randomly selected (in the case case of the Initial Receivables from the 
Preliminary Portfolio) and shall meet the Eligibility Criteria set forth in section 2.2.2.4.2 of the 
Additional Information. 
The preliminary loan portfolio from which the Initial Receivables shall be selected (the 
“Preliminary Portfolio”) comprises SEVENTY-TWO THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FIFTEEN 
(72,615) Loans, with a total Outstanding Balance as of 31 August 2022 of NINE HUNDRED 
NINETY MILLION SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY-ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED 
THIRTEEN EUROS (€990,681,113). These are Loans with no grace period for the repayment of 
principal or interest, with constant instalments and concession periods ranging from 12 months to 


 
 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Additional Information 
 
 
110 
 
130 months, and with an average financed amount of THIRTEEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED 
FORTY-TWO EUROS (€13,642). The estimation of interest accrued and unpaid before the Date 
of Incorporation for the Preliminary Portfolio is equal to or slightly lower than TWO MILLION 
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND EUROS (€2,500,000). 
Any Additional Receivables to be offered by the Seller to the Fund on each relevant Offer Date 
will be existing receivables held by the Seller and shall meet the Eligibility Criteria set out in 
section 2.2.2.4.2 of the Additional Information. 
The Borrowers under the Loans from which the Receivables arise are individuals and legal 
persons’ who were resident or registered, as applicable, in Spain as of the date of formalisation of 
each Loan. 
2.2.2.2. 
Review of the selected assets securitised through the Fund upon being established 
Deloitte has reviewed a sample of 531 randomly selected loans out of the Preliminary Portfolio 
from which the Initial Receivables shall be selected. Additionally, Deloitte has verified the data 
disclosed in the following stratification tables in respect of the Preliminary Portfolio. 
The results, applying a confidence level of at least 99%, are set out in the Special Securitisation 
Reports on the Preliminary Portfolio prepared by Deloitte for the purposes of complying with 
article 22.2 of the EU Securitisation Regulation. SCF, as Originator, confirms that no significant 
adverse findings have been detected 
The Management Company has requested from the CNMV the exemption to submitting the 
Special Securitisation Reports on the Preliminary Portfolio according to second paragraph of 
article 22.1 c) of Law 5/2015. 
None of the Fund, the Management Company, the Arranger, the Lead Manager, the Paying Agent 
or any other party to the Transaction Documents other than the Seller has undertaken or will 
undertake any investigation, search or other action to verify the details of the Receivables and the 
Loan Agreements or to establish the creditworthiness of the Borrowers. The Seller will not assign 
to the Fund any Loans in respect of which issues are detected while carrying out the audit.

The Loans with a down payment equal to or below 20% of the Vehicle’s value, amounts to 
61.48% of the Loans and 64.41% of the Outstanding Balance of the Receivables as of 31 
August 2022.

(iv) 
Amount financed over the value of the vehicle 
The initial amount does not exceed the sum of the purchase price of the financed vehicle 
(“vehicle’s value”) plus, where appropriate, the financing of the formalisation fees 
(opening, study and information, where appropriate) and/or insurance costs related to the 
transaction. 
The immediate depreciation suffered by a New Vehicle (vehicles with an age, since 
registration, of less than or equal to twelve (12) months) at the time that it leaves the 
corresponding dealer approximately represents 20% of its value, moreover, it is also 
necessary to take into account the average monthly depreciation, which is approximately a 
1.5% (monthly) additional depreciation of the vehicle value for the first year. The 
cumulative depreciation during the twelve (12) first months since registration can reach 
approximately a 38.00%. A 0.6% (monthly) depreciation for the second and third years, a 
0.5% (monthly) depreciation for the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh years, and a 0.4% 
(monthly) depreciation for the subsequent years. 
In case of Used Vehicles (vehicles with an age, since registration, of more than twelve (12) 
months), in addition to the cumulative depreciation during the twelve (12) first months 
since registration, it should be added a 0.6% (monthly) depreciation to the market value of 
the vehicle for the second and third years, and a 0.5% (monthly) depreciation for the fourth, 
fifth, sixth and seventh year, and a 0.4% (monthly) depreciation for the subsequent years. 
Therefore, if a Borrower defaults under a Loan, it cannot be discarded that the value of the 
financed Vehicle is sufficient to cover the unpaid amount under the Loan. 
The Loans with an amount financed equal to or above 80% of the Vehicle’s value, amounts 
to 49.22% of the Loans and 56.63% of the current Outstanding Balance of the Receivables 
as of 31 August 2022.

accrued and unpaid interest before the corresponding Payment Date. 
The assignment of the Additional Receivables will be full and unconditional from the Payment 
Date on which they are acquired and paid by the Fund and will be made for the entire remaining 
term until the total maturity of the Receivables, in accordance with section 3.3.2 of this Additional 
Information. 
2.2.3. 
Legal nature of the assets. 
The Receivables securitised by means of their assignment to the Fund are credit rights deriving 
from Loans granted by SCF to individuals and legal entities’ who were resident or registered, as 
applicable, in Spain as of the date of formalisation of each Loan, for the financing of the 
acquisition of New Vehicles or Used Vehicles, which have been granted pursuant to Law 16/2011 
(and, with respect to the Additional Receivables, pursuant to Law 16/0211 and/or any other 
relevant regulations applicable from time to time). 
Some of the Loan Agreements from which the Receivables derive include personal guarantees by 
co-owners of the Vehicles. In addition, all of the Loan Agreements have a reservation of title 
clause, regardless of the fact that the Loan Agreements have been granted by means of a deed 
(póliza) granted before a public notary or in a private agreement; however, not all reservation of 
title clauses are registered in the Register of Instalment Sales of Movable Properties. 
The Receivables will be directly assigned to the Fund, upon being sold by the Seller and acquired 
by the Fund, on the terms set forth in section 3.3 of this Additional Information. 
2.2.4. 
Expiration or maturity date(s) of assets. 
Each of the selected Loans matures in accordance with its particular terms and conditions as set out 
in the relevant Loan Agreement, without prejudice to any partial periodic repayment instalments. 
The Borrowers may prepay all or any part of the Outstanding Balance of the Receivables arising 
from the Loans at any time during the term of the Loans, ceasing the accrual of interest on the 
prepaid portion as from the date of repayment. 
The maturity date of any selected Loan will be in no event later than 20 September 2035 (the 
“Final Maturity Date”). 
2.2.5. 
Amount of the Receivables. 
The Receivables assigned by SCF to the Fund will have a maximum amount of Outstanding 
Balance equal to or slightly higher than SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION EUROS (€700,000,000), 
equivalent to the nominal value of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the 
Class D Notes and the Class E Notes. 
The Preliminary Portfolio from which the Receivables to be assigned on the Date of Incorporation 
will be extracted is composed by SEVENTY-TWO THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FIFTEEN 
(72,615) Loans, with a total Outstanding Balance of NINE HUNDRED NINETY MILLION SIX 


 
 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Additional Information 
 
 
129 
 
HUNDRED EIGHTY-ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED THIRTEEN EUROS (€990,681,113) 
as of 31 August 2022. 
2.2.6. 
Loan to value ratio or level of collateralisation. 
The Loans comprising the Preliminary Portfolio are not secured by real estate mortgage security 
(garantía hipotecaria); thus, the information concerning the loan to value ratio does not apply. 
2.2.7. 
The method of origination or creation of assets, and for loans and credit agreements, the 
principal lending criteria and an indication of any loans which do not meet these criteria and 
any rights or obligations to make further advances. 
The Loans comprising the Preliminary Portfolio have been originated by SCF according to its 
usual analysis and credit risk assessment procedures for the origination of loans granted to natural 
persons or legal persons for the financing of the acquisiton of New Vehicles and Used Vehicles 
(“SCF Policies”). The Loans comprising the Preliminary Portfolio have either been originated by 
SCF directly or SCF has acquired them by universal succession from Santander Consumer, E.F.C., 
S.A. 
In this regard:  
(i) 
100% of the Outstanding Balance of the Initial Receivables complies with the current SCF 
Policies contained in this section 2.2.7. 
(ii) 
The Additional Receivables to be assigned to the Fund will be granted in accordance with 
the SCF Policies described in this section. 
(iii) 
SCF undertakes to disclose to the Management Company without delay any material 
change in the SCF Policies. 
2.2.7.1. 
Criteria and procedures to grant loans 
The efficient management of the credit risk is one of the main aspects on which the strategy of 
SCF is based. 
The main principles of the risk management, are as follows: 
• 
Common basic model adapted to the specific needs of each market and to the business 
structure, both according to the type of customer and according to activity and geography. 
• 
Continuous improvement of credit risk management processes, tools and methodology. 
• 
Priority for risk quality criteria; business growth based on the maintenance/improvement of 
the quality of risk assets. 
• 
Executive capacity based on experience and thorough knowledge of sectors and markets in 
which it operates. 
• 
Functional independence with shared hierarchy, so that the goals and methodology can be 
established by the Risk Area, at the same time that the organisational structure is adapted to 
the commercial strategy and to the business needs defined by SCF’s top management. 
• 
Risk management by means of differentiated processes and systems according to the type of 
risk and the segment of customers and products. 


 
 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Additional Information 
 
 
130 
 
• 
Specialisation and differentiation of the credit process (admission, formalisation, follow-up 
and recovery) according to the segment of customers. 
• 
Use of systems such as credit scorings helping to make credit decisions and serving as tools 
that make the credit granting process more efficient, make the credit behaviour monitoring 
easier and enable the treatment according to homogeneous groups of risk. 
• 
Relevance of risk supervision in order to prevent eventual impairments in the risk quality, 
as an anticipatory measure. 
• 
Diversification of risk, limiting, in general, the level of total indebtedness that the consumer 
can assure. 
In particular, for the automotive sector business line, SCF has established, among others, the 
following general principles for credit risk management: 
• 
Segmentation consists on the classification of the credit risk according to certain criteria in 
order to optimize the efficiency in its management; the segmentation allows: 
✓ 
To analyse the credit risk differently according to its type. 
✓ 
To assess yield and credit risk better. 
✓ 
To improve the decision-making process, since more appropriate information is 
available. 
The segmentation for the automotive business line, is the following: 
✓ 
New vehicles for employed individuals 
✓ 
Used vehicles for employed individuals 
✓ 
New and used vehicles for self-employed individuals 
✓ 
New and used vehicles for enterprises 
• 
Integrity, given that risks are globally managed (admission, follow-up and recovery). 
These criteria are based on four pillars: credit risk policies, automation of decisions, strictness in 
analysis, and efficient processes and systems. 
The approach used for the credit risk management is the credit cycle, which is understood as the 
set of actions to be performed in order to administer the risk in credit transactions, for the purposes 
of optimizing the ratio between risk and profitability. 
The credit cycle has four stages: planning, admission, portfolio management and collection or 
recovery. 
(i) 
Sourcing channels 
Transactions may be sourced by means of the following channels: 


 
 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Additional Information 
 
 
131 
 
• 
Office/Agent/Representative: acts as an intermediate channel for the receipt of the 
documentation. 
• 
Telephone: Dealers call the call-centre, which captures the application data. 
• 
WEB: it is the customer who captures the application data through a website of the 
Dealer/Market place.  
Agents and delegates are those natural persons or legal persons that, independently and without 
any employment relationship with SCF, act on their own as mediators in order to attract new 
customers and to offer products marketed by SCF; therefore, their duties are limited to the 
presentation of transactions. 
The “Dealers” are the legal or natural persons that assign financing transactions of their clients to 
SCF. 
(ii) 
Products and risks 
The definition of the maximum limits, both for amounts and for terms, to be established as 
conditions of the asset products that are marketed, is made by applying risk criteria and 
commercial considerations jointly between the Risk Area and the corresponding business areas. 
In this respect, the main credit determining factors are the following: 
• 
Market assessments of the assets to be financed must be supported in some cases by 
independent appraisals and, in other cases, by data extracted from technical publications 
(e.g., Gamvan and Eurotax). 
• 
The need, according to the type of product, that the client provides a minimum initial 
amount from its own resources (minimum initial down payment). 
• 
Financing terms must be consistent with the useful life of the product to be acquired and 
must be proportional to the repayment capacity of the borrower. 
From the commercial point of view, the following is deemed essential: 
• 
The strategic decisions communicated by SCF’s top management. 
• 
The financial terms of the transaction (fees, interests and expenses) must be proportional to 
the risk level to be assumed according to the product and term. 
• 
The competitive position as compared to the offers from competitors. 
Apart from the decisions made within the aforementioned scope, there are other bodies that may 
deal with these matters: the board of directors, the executive committee, the management 
committee, and the executive committee for risks and the local marketing and monitoring 
committee for products and operations. 
Once the limits have been established, the business areas include them in their products and the 
Risk Area must take them into account for its internal procedures. 
(iii) 
Operations with Standardised Risks 
According to the type of client and the total risk assumed by SCF in the transaction, the application 
is classified within Standardised Risks in accordance with the following criteria: 
• 
All the applications in which clients are natural persons. 
• 
Applications for proposals from legal persons when the outstanding credit risk is lower than 
or equal to €250,000. Likewise, we have: 


 
 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Additional Information 
 
 
132 
 
✓ 
Transactions with companies in which any Public Bodies (organismos públicos) 
have a majority or minority participation. 
✓ 
Transactions with foundations, associations (profit or non-profit organisations), civil 
partnerships, cooperatives, community properties (comunidad de bienes), property 
owners’ communities (comunidad de propietarios), etc. 
(a) 
Application admission procedure 
The admission procedure consists of a series of actions aimed at the resolution of credit 
applications with the purpose of (i) approving credit transactions for those clients that are in 
the target market and meet the requirements, (ii) rejecting applications identified as having 
a higher risk of non-payment, and (iii) providing alternatives for those applications that 
require a more in-depth analysis. 
The admission of transactions always starts at the request of the Dealer or customer in the 
Dealer’s website or Marketplace. 
This commencement may take place by means of a telephone call made to the call centre or 
by means of the capture by the Dealer in the WEB system implemented to that end. 
In all cases, the process is started with the gathering of data and the feeding of such data in 
the systems implemented to that end (AS400/FICRES is the tool used at SCF). 
During the registration process of the computer application, identification data of the 
borrowers and guarantors (name and surname, corporate name, Tax Identification 
Number/Code), the terms and conditions of the transaction (amount, term, purpose, 
payments, etc.) and the information data (personal, employment and solvency) are 
introduced in the systems. 
In the event that the transaction has been approved and is to be formalised, the 
aforementioned data is validated and verified by means of the submission of certain 
documents such as the National Identity Card (DNI), Tax Identification Number (NIF), last 
payslip, last tax return, evidence of property owned, document for direct debiting, deed of 
incorporation, corporate income tax, balance sheets, etc. Only in cases of open banking (the 
customer has allowed to access to his consumer banking information such as incomes, 
transactions and payment history), it is allowed not to provide documents related to 
incomes. 
Aside from the information provided by customers, additional information is automatically 
obtained when the customers' identity document numbers are entered in the computer 
application. This additional information comes from (i) SCF’s own database (in respect of 
the customer’s behaviour in previous transactions), as well as (ii) external databases 
(negative such as Asnef-Equifax or Experian, or regarding default, such as R.A.I. or B.D.I. 
or fraud bureau as Confirma or Iovation). 
With all this information and/or any other information that might be considered necessary, 
the application enters the assessment process, which can be: 
• 
automatic: the assessment system is able to make a decision without the intervention 
of an analyst. 
• 
manual: the assessment is made by an analyst; this occurs when the decision to be 
made is contrary to the decision of the model (forced decisions) or where the model, 
due to type of transaction, cannot make an automatic decision (grey area of scoring 
or fulfilment of rules). 
In this admission procedure there are no pre-approved loans.

(b) 
Delegated powers or duties. 
The procedure followed for the delegation of powers at the Standardised Risk Area 
established by SCF in connection with the approval of transactions within its scope is the 
following: 
• 
The powers relating to risks are granted by the Manager of the Risk Area in a 
hierarchical manner.

(c) 
Electronic Authorisation 
All the applications requiring a manual analysis by the ODU are transferred to the 
Electronic Authorisation system, which allows managing this analysis by means of displays 
of information on the application to be manually assessed. 
This tool allows: 
• 
To make a decision on the application: “approval”, “rejection” or apply for such 
additional requirements as may be deemed necessary by the analyst for the decision-
making process. 
• 
To identify the analyst(s) that has/have analysed the application, and the number of 
times that such application has been reviewed. 
• 
To register the reason supporting the decision. 
• 
To include, in the section of Remarks, additional detailed information on the reason 
supporting the decision made. 
(d) 
Scoring tools 
(I) 
Models used in SCF 
The model gives a score to each application, which is obtained from the sum of the various 
variables that are scored. Once the application has been scored and according to the rules 
applied by the system, the application is introduced a decision-making matrix for its 
classification as approved, rejected or grey area. 
The list below shows the various models for admission that are currently applied for 
assessing applications relating to the automotive sector as regards the Loans from which the 
Receivables derive:

of ANV1, AUS3 is the recalibration of AUS2, AUS2 is the recalibration of AUS1, ATN2 is 
the recalibration of ATN1, PME3 is the recalibration of PME2 and PME2 is the 
recalibration of PME1. 
Regarding development and manager: 
External-FICO means developed by an external supplier, in this case FICO (Fair Isaac 
Company). 
External-Experian means developed by an external supplier, in this case Experian.

Assessment and answers of the system 


 
 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Additional Information 
 
 
135 
 
Once the process of an assessment is completed it produces a result, which can be: 
• 
Accept the application. 
• 
Reject the application. 
• 
Review (grey area). In this case, the model does not have sufficient arguments for 
the acceptance or rejection of the application; consequently, the decision must be 
manually made by a Risk Analyst, according to his/her opinion. 
In order to obtain this result, the models use two types of information: 
• 
Scoring: the calculation is made using the scoring model. This scoring is understood 
as a measurement of the probability of payment default. The lower the score, the 
higher the risk of payment default. 
• 
Rules: SCF has only negative rules, which highlight all weak points observed in the 
application, such as fraud, indebtedness, insecurity of employment, previous 
experience, etc. 
The combination of the “scoring” with the “rules results” establishes the basis upon which 
the result of the model or, as shown below, the resolution table is determined. As a 
minimum, a different table will be applied to each model, but various resolution tables can 
also be applied according to the Dealer, profile, product or any other segmentation 
considered. 
SCF Model Rules 
In order to strengthen the decision, a system of credit rules divided into Exclusion Rules, 
Review Rules and Information Rules is established. 
✓ 
Exclusion Rules 
These are those rules that invalidate the result of the scoring assessment for a transaction, 
regardless of the score obtained. These rules operate as minimum acceptance criteria and 
will be applied to all the applications assessed by the model. 
✓ 
Review Rules 
This involves applications that have any parameter outside of the standards requiring a 
confirmation or review exclusively by the analyst. These rules are considered to be a 
“filter”, so that the application that fulfils one of these rules cannot be approved by the 
system whilst the analyst does not validate that such transaction has been completed 
pursuant to the generally required criteria. 
✓ 
Information Rules 
These are rules with indications relating to the actions to be followed prior to the 
formalisation of the Loan. For example, in the models for the automotive sector, 
information is provided according to the rules on the formalisation before a public notary or 
the reservation of title.

Criteria for additional assurances in vehicle financing transactions 
A deed (póliza) granted before a public notary is generally required, as a general rule, when 
the amount of principal to be financed is equal or above €50,000 (including pre-authorised 
outstanding risk). In case high fraud risk profile, deed (póliza) granted before a public 
notary is required, when the amount of principal to be financed is equal or above €36,000. 
There is always a reservation of title and, as a general rule, it is required to be registered in 
the Register of Instalment Sales of Movable Properties when the amount of principal to be 
financed is equal or above €24,000. Also, registration is required in case of irregularities 
(CBU) and when the ODU analyst deems appropriate. 
(f) 
Formalisation of the transactions 
Once the transaction has been approved and accepted by the client, the resolution is 
captured in the system for its formalisation. The steps to be followed are: 
• 
Printing the Loan Agreement for its execution: Depending on the amount, the 
agreement is intervened in a deed (póliza) granted before a public notary. 
• 
Receiving the signed Loan Agreement and supporting documents that justify the data 
provided in the application. 
• 
Reviewing the correct signature of the Loan Agreement and the completeness of the 
documents provided. 
• 
Formalizing the transaction.

Once the transaction is formalised, it must be registered from an accounting point of view, 
number plates must be requested, formalities for reservation of title must be carried out if 
applicable, the dossier must be sent to the digitalisation centre. 
2.2.7.2. 
Risk management and monitoring 
Both the Business Department and Risk Departments monitor periodically the behaviour and 
admission models and the general performance of the transactions in accordance with its processes 
and policies, focusing on the client and all his/her/its exposures with the group. 
These processes are defined under three fundamental pillars: 
• 
Periodic review of the credit rating (behaviour scoring). 
• 
Analysis and management of alerts relating to credit quality. 
• 
Monitoring of the evolution of portfolios. 
Additionally, they carry out the validation of credit rating models in order to ensure that the pillars 
supporting the monitoring process are correctly calibrated, which guarantees the monitoring 
quality. 
The credit risk control, analysis and consolidation areas will generate the information necessary for 
an efficient portfolio monitoring. 
(i) 
Risk monitoring reports 
The credit risk is monitored by means of the preparation and analysis of periodic information on 
the credit portfolio (current credit, report on scoring behaviour, etc.). 
Behaviour reports are prepared on a biannual basis regarding the transactions that have been 
assessed by the models, in order to carry out a monitoring not only of the score obtained and of the 
assessment result (combination of score and credit rules) as regards default rates, but also of each 
one of the variables captured during the contracting process of the application in order to check the 
stability of population, to carry out an analysis of sub-populations (regional, branches, objects, 
etc.) for the purposes of adapting the model, if necessary. 
(ii) 
Portfolio Management Applications 
SCP (Strategic Commercial Plan). Annually a report is prepared by the Business and Risk 
Departments which contains all information on each portfolio (ie. admission indicators, risk 
metrics, limits, policies, recovery management, projects, decision-making models). 
MRR (Monthly Risk Report). A monthly report is prepared by the Risk Department to monitor the 
portfolio, which analyses and evaluates any deviation from metrics or indicators established by 
SCP, and establishes a control and mitigation plans if necessary. 
2.2.7.3. 
Recovery process 
At SCF, the design of the collection strategy is entrusted exclusively to the CBU. 
Collections are focused on the efficient management through the application of strategies giving 
priority to collection according to the client risk, the establishment of appropriate processes and the 
use of specialised systems. 


 
 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Additional Information

The operations for the management (in a later stage) of the defaulted loans consist in the uploading 
and reception on the SCF’s systems, of the unpaid instalments for its automatic classification of 
the files according to its level of default. 
Based on the abovementioned classification, the management of the recovery for these files with 
unpaid instalments will be carried out by the massive telephone management or personalised 
contact, as applicable, according to the strategies defined in the collections tool (tool for the 
distribution of unpaid files to various recovery agents, according to product, client risk and the age 
of the non-payment). 
When a credit transaction registers a payment default, a payment default file is created (or 
reactivated if such file has been already created). Therefore, for each transaction that has generated 
a default, a default tranche is automatically assigned (based on the age and type of product) and a 
management “pot” is assigned, based on the strategies defined in the collections tool, for its 
management by the different recovery actors. 
Non-payment recovery procedures are carried out following the strategy defined by the CBU, 
which varies depending on the type of product, the outstanding credit risk of the contract and the 
maturity of the debt, as shown schematically in the following portfolio map: 
 
Risk is the outstanding amount of the loan, adding, if any, the amount of unpaid instalments. 
As provided in the above portfolio map, for the management of non-performing transactions by 
SCF, there are different axes differentiated by: (i) product/portfolio; (ii) amount of 
outstanding/unpaid instalments; and (iii) age of default (number of days of stay in a tranche…). 
(a) 
Self-cure 
In this first phase of management and on a daily basis, a selection is made of the customers with 
the best historical payment behaviour so that they can self-manage their debt. 
Subsequently, a communication strategy is implemented with the sending of SMS/emails with the 
corresponding payment link as a reminder so that the customer proceeds to regularise their position 
and so that they do not continue to be managed in the following phases. 
(b) 
Telephone collection 
Daily, the collections tool performs, following the guidelines of the CBU, the classification of 
unpaid contracts and their assignment to the telephone collection providers that carry out the 
following actions: 


 
 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Additional Information 
 
 
139 
 
− 
Telephone calls to customers in order to contact them and get direct debt collection 
through the different collection channels. 
− 
Management of the location of the clients with whom it has not been possible to contact, 
as well as treatment of the incidents detected in the calls. 
The information flow between SCF and the telephone collection providers consists in the daily 
delivery by SCF of the necessary information to each collection company with the details of the 
contact and non-payment of the clients that, by portfolio map, have to manage in this phase. In the 
same way, daily, the telephone collection providers return the detail with all the procedures carried 
out on the assigned portfolio. 
The telephone recovery providers carry out a massive management of the portfolio they receive 
daily. This management consists of an automatic predictive dialing, carried out by a team of tele-
operators that adhere to the authorised arguments from CBU, leaving all the transactions carried 
out by the tele-operators reflected in the SCF systems. 
In addition, on a recurring basis, transactions with unpaid payments are forwarded to the telephone 
recovery providers, following the instructions contained in the remittances calendar which are 
parameterised monthly in the SCF systems. 
In parallel, SMS are sent to customers including payment links to encourage them to self-cure 
instalments in arrears through SCF’s online payment website. 
Additionally, daily monitoring and control of the strategies is carried out by the telephone recovery 
providers and the managers. This means that in respect of the portfolio assigned to them, the 
results obtained and the steps taken are reviewed every day, reflected in daily monitoring reports 
with a continuous comparison of results, objectives, trends and behaviours. 
To control the activity the following actions are performed: 
− 
Periodic listening of calls and their valuation in terms of quality and debt recovery 
(calibrations are also made so that all telephone recovery providers reach the same service 
levels). 
− 
Reports with the efforts made by telephone recovery providers, with daily report for their 
control and monitoring. 
− 
Periodic committees to analyse the results from the activity, compliance with the 
agreements monitoring the level of services provided by recovery providers (the 
“Services Level Agreements” or “SLAs”), etc. 
For these purposes, SLAs are the agreements to monitor the level of services provided by recovery 
providers. 
(c) 
Specialised management 
As described above, and based on the distribution strategy defined according to the portfolio map, 
customer files with unpaid instalments will be managed through a specialised network, both by 
field collectors and specialised telephone recovery providers.

The activity of this phase comprises as (i) the personal management or telephone specialised 
contact for the collection of the defaulting clients / files in which the age of the oldest instalment 
does not exceed one hundred and eighty (180) days starting from its maturity, according to the 
portfolio map; and (ii) those files that, although may not be meeting those features, are included in 
this phase derived from Bank of Spain Circular 4/2017, of 27 November. 
The recovery management by the field collectors is carried out through visits to the clients to 
achieve the regularisation of the debt, or failing that, to reach an agreement to withdraw the 
financed asset, restructuring, repossessions, etc. The objective is the recovery of the debt, and in 
order to achieve this, in addition to the recovery of the unpaid instalment, alternative financial 
solutions will be sought that allow the client to regularize his/her situation through the levers 
mentioned above, always within the compliance and regulations established by the Bank of Spain 
and the Corporate Policy of the Santander Group. 
The criteria for the distribution of transactions to field collectors, which are distributed throughout 
the national territory, is implemented through the portfolio map with an automatic assignment of 
the files by postal codes. 
The recovery management of the field collectors is carried out in person, as a qualitative element 
of physical location and visit to the borrower. 
All recovery management processes must be registered by the field collectors in the log linked to 
each of the files, by specifying the day of the particular recovery management, its details and the 
result obtained; this allows to ensure the traceability of the management tasks performed, given 
that the application allows to identify who made the entry in the log. 
(d) 
Legal and Extrajudicial management 
As regards the Circular 5/2012 of the Bank of Spain on transparency of banking services, if the 
borrower fails to comply with his/her/its payment obligations and before bringing any legal action, 
there are procedures to comply with the requirement to inform the borrower of the potential 
consequences in terms of costs of default interest and other expenses, which would accrue if the 
payment default persists, and of the possibilities and consequences that an eventual enforcement of 
the debt would have on his/her/its interests and assets. 
The management of the files in respect of which it has been decided to initiate legal actions is 
carried out through the network of external lawyers, coordinated and controlled by internal legal 
teams. 
The transfer to Legal Management Department is automatically made according to the products 
and criteria relating to the age of the debt, outstanding credit risk and number of unpaid 
instalments, as shown below:

Exceptionally, the transfer of transactions to Legal Management Department may be anticipated, 
outside the criteria defined in the allocation policies, provided that such transfer has the prior 
authorisation of the Commercial Director or the Legal Management Department Director.

For the transfer to Legal Management Department to be formalised the transaction must in all 
cases be registered in a contentious file, so that it is assigned to the contentious balances, 
introducing other data such as the procedure, action, court and the lawyer or manager to whom the 
file is assigned. 
The management of the files will be assigned according to the product and the risk, based on the 
prior litigious matrix, and in the case of the category “Companies”, according to the following 
distribution: 
• 
Companies with a risk exceeding € 75,000. These transactions will be assigned to the 
branch of companies (oficina de empresas), where all of them will be centrally managed. 
• 
Companies with a risk lower than € 75,000, insolvency proceedings and rest of 
products. These will be assigned to the various area managers that, in turn, will assign the 
file to an external legal counsel, according to geographic criteria (and the same circuit as the 
motor vehicle product will be followed). 
In any case, they will complete such documents, whether by drafting simple debt balance 
certificates (certificados de deuda) or by requesting the administrative department to send them, by 
requesting the more complex certificates, or by gathering from the notaries public that intervened 
the Loan Agreements the certification of the same; likewise, the legal counsel will draft and 
register the claims for payment, and the gathering of the remaining documents required to file the 
suit (certified mail, agreement, amongst others). 
As a general rule, (i) claims in relation to files assigned to the external lawyers must be filed with 
the court within twenty (20) days from the assignment of such files -and the documents related to 
them- to the lawyers, and (ii) claims in relation to files assigned to the branch of companies and 
mortgage enforcement claims must be filed with the court within thirty (30) days from the 
assignment of such files -and the documents related to them- to the lawyers. 
Follow-up of the process is performed via entries made in the management log of the file; the 
external legal counsel will send, for a detailed follow-up of the process, the most significant court 
rulings or orders, such as answers or challenges to the claim, judgments, etc. 
From the moment on which the file is received, the extrajudicial recovery management begins in 
parallel, without interrupting the deadline for submission of the claim or the initiation of the 
judicial procedure. 
In this regards, as noted above, in parallel to any court claim, extrajudicial procedures in an 
amicable manner are carried out through telephone management and visits by the field collectors 
managers of the Network. 
Any cash collections made must be credited on the same day, or depending on the time of 
collection, on the following day, to the corresponding bank account. Those made by virtue of writs 
of return (i.e. writs of return generated by judicial retentions of current account balances, payroll, 
payments made by the client to the court, etc.) issued by the courts and tribunals will be sent by the 
solicitors (procuradores) to the central services for their payment into the current bank accounts 
held to such end and for their accounting registration. 
Court orders or rulings (judgments) are enforced after having updated the solvency of the borrower 
(if necessary), by seizing any assets (i.e. real estate properties or salaries, where applicable). 


 
 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Additional Information 
 
 
142 
 
The seizure of assets, where applicable, must be registered in the relevant public registers as soon 
as the order for registration is obtained; the entries recording such seizures must be renewed in the 
relevant public registries every four years, if the amount has not been previously collected. 
On the other hand, the award of assets is authorised by the Contentious manager, following their 
appraisal by appraisal companies/independent experts. 
Once that the assets have been awarded, they are accounted, together with a copy of the Writ of 
Award (auto de adjudicación) and the appraisal of the awarded asset. 
After the legal phase, all defaulted transactions which, under the defined criteria, and due to age, 
have not successfully been recovered in prior phases, will be managed by External Recovery 
Agencies (“ERA”), according to the following process: 
• 
The transactions will be distributed among various ERA, and this generates greater 
competition amongst them. The management will continue to be made via telephone, by 
combining the mass dialing with the portfolio management and by giving great importance 
to locating clients by means of dialing at different times of the day and by looking for new 
data. 
• 
Each ERA has a management deadline, after which they will lose the transactions that have 
surpassed such deadline; they may only keep those transactions for which they have 
obtained a commitment to imminent payment. To that end, the ERA must request the 
corresponding extension of the deadline that must be authorised by SCF. 
In view of the type of transactions and the difficulties for their collection, payment agreements are 
deemed a basic management tool; in these agreements, the customer may be encouraged to pay 
with reductions/write-offs of debt that must be previously authorised by SCF, according to the 
policy established in this respect. 
2.2.7.4. 
Money laundering and fraud 
In compliance with the risk policy of SCF, any type of credit risk transaction –no matter the level 
of guarantees– must be rejected if the applicant is not duly identified, or if the applicant and/or 
applicant’s activity are not properly known, or if the origin of the guarantees offered as security or 
the source of funds used to repay the transaction are not sufficiently identified. 
(i) 
Fraud prevention in the admission process 
Such prevention is carried out as follows: 
• 
Monitoring and parameterisation of fraud rules in the decision-making systems (within the 
block of Exclusion Rules described above). The failure to comply with these rules makes 
the application rejected. 
• 
Verification of the documents delivered by the customer upon the formalisation of the 
agreement. For SMEs, it is necessary to obtain economic data about the companies by 
means of the external provider “Informa”, which guarantees the truthfulness of the financial 
statements produced by the customer. Following this verification, the copy to be sent must 
be a perfectly legible copy. 
A fraud profile is created based on the characteristics of the transaction, by classifying the 
transactions into high, medium or low profiles. 


 
 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Additional Information 
 
 
143 
 
Instructions have been given so that special reviews of documentation are made for high fraud 
profile transactions, with intensive review. 
The transactions are also checked with the Confirma file, which shares fraud information with 
other entities. If any warning is triggered in this process, the transaction must be analysed as if it 
had a high fraud profile. 
In case of online origination, Iovation information is used. Iovation extracts information from the 
customer device to identify potential fraud, such information including the IP (“Internet Protocol”) 
address used by the device, the number of times that the device is used to access on-line services 
within a period of time, etc. 
(ii) 
Fraud Committee 
The management for fraud prevention in the whole credit cycle requires a high level of 
involvement of all areas concerned. 
(a) 
Main Powers 
The purpose of the Fraud Committee is the management of fraud prevention throughout the 
credit cycle. 
The Fraud Committee’s main functions are: 
- 
To continue with the collection and recovery management, since it is considered 
appropriate to further deepen the management operations, gather more information, 
or because it is ultimately deduced that the incident is not subject to fraud and, 
therefore, the file is reclassified. Any alteration of this status must be authorised by 
the Fraud Committee. In any case, if there are reasonable doubts about the validity 
of a transaction (impersonation or other alleged fraud), recovery actions must be 
preventively suspended until the possible fraud has been analysed. 
- 
To regularize and dissociate the borrower, from the moment it has been verified 
that the borrower has been impersonated, or his/her/its documents have been used to 
impersonate them, or they have been stolen. In all these cases, a formal complaint 
must have been filed before the Police or a Court by the affected person; such formal 
complaint is also analysed and reviewed together with the rest of documents 
produced. The regularisation implies to enter the debt in the accounting books as an 
operational risk loss (not as change in management arrears (variación de mora de 
gestion) (“VMG”)), within the category of external fraud. 
- 
Legal Advice, when the person or entity that has carried out the irregular activity 
has been identified; the appropriate criminal actions will start accordingly, and the 
external lawyer to whom the file has been assigned will file a formal complaint and 
bring legal actions by means of petitions or claims; in this case a formal complaint is 
no longer managed by any attorney or representative of SCF. 
In those cases in which a legal action is not brought against the borrower under the 
transaction, he/she/it will be dissociated and the transaction will be regularised, by 
registering in the books the debt corresponding to the file as an operational risk loss 
(not as VMG), within the category of external fraud. 
In those cases in which a legal action is brought against the borrower under the 
transaction due to document forgery, the borrower will not be separated and the debt 
of the transaction will be transferred to operational risk losses (not as VMG), within 
the category of external fraud.

- 
Delinquent loan, when there are no signs that the amounts due will be recovered 
and in view of the insolvency of borrowers, it is not considered to file any judicial 
claim. 
- 
To determine whether SCF appears as a private plaintiff and brings the criminal 
proceedings deemed appropriate to safeguard its principles and purposes. 
- 
The Chairman will inform, together with the head of Fraud Management in SCF 
management committee, and upon request by such committee, both of the minutes 
and the relevant facts, improvements, involvements of other areas, etc. 
The Fraud Committee shall have attributions of up to €150,000 per fraud (per transaction). 
Beyond this amount the authorisation must be obtained from SCF’s executive risks 
committee. 
(b) 
Composition and Functioning of the Fraud Committee 
The Fraud Committee will comprise the members appointed by the executive committee of 
SCF Risks. 
The chair of the Fraud Committee will correspond to a member of the management 
committee. 
The following persons are appointed as permanent members of the Fraud Committee: 
A least one person will attend on behalf of the following Departments / Areas: 
− 
Head of Fraud Management and Standardised Risks Dealer (who will also act as 
Secretary); 
− 
Representative of the CBU; 
− 
Representative of the Non-Financial Risk Control (Control de Riesgos No 
Financieros – ‘CRNF’); 
− 
Representative of the business areas of automotive sector and consumption; and 
− 
On request when appropriate, Representatives from other areas may be invited. 
2.2.7.5. 
Arrears and recovery information of the SCF loan portfolio 
The following tables show the historical performance of auto loans originated by SCF with similar 
characteristics to the Loans included in the Preliminary Portfolio (i.e. a portfolio that meets with 
most of the Eligibility Criteria established in section 2.2.8 (ii) of the Additional Information and, in 
particular, a portfolio where each and every Loan has a maximum Regulatory PD of 6% and where 
no Loan has been derived from a Refinancing or Restructuring) with the aim to inform potential 
investors of the performance of the auto loan portfolio. 
Delinquency ratio 
The table shows the delinquency ratio of auto loans, calculated as the balance of the relevant 
delinquency bucket as of the date set out in the table below divided by the balance of the total 
exposure of loans as of that same date.

Monthly constant prepayment rate (CPR) 
The following table shows the monthly constant prepayment rate (CPR) of SCF auto loan portfolio 
(exclusively for the financing of the purchase of New Vehicles and Used Vehicles). The monthly 
CPR has been calculated by dividing (i) the sum of all cash flows related to prepayments made by 
borrowers in the relevant month shown in the table below; by (ii) the outstanding balance of the 
auto loan portfolio (New Vehicles and Used Vehicles) at the end of that same month. The monthly 
CPR (“X”) is used to calculate an annualised CPR using the following formula: 1-(1-X)^12.

Substitution of the securitised assets. 
Procedure 
If it is observed during the life of the Receivables that any of them failed on any date of 
assignment to the Fund (i.e, the Date of Incorporation or any Purchase Date, as applicable), to meet 
the Eligibility Criteria requirements and representations and warranties contained in sections 
2.2.2.4.2 or 2.2.8.(ii) of this Additional Information, the Seller agrees, subject to the Management 
Company’s consent, to proceed forthwith to remedy such failure, and provided that such remedy is 
not possible, to replace or redeem the affected Receivable by automatically terminating the 
assignment of the affected Receivable, subject to the following rules: 
(i) 
The party becoming aware of the existence of a non-conforming Receivable, whether the 
Seller or the Management Company, will notify the other party of such circumstance. The 
Seller will have up to fifteen (15) Business Days from such notice to proceed to remedy 
such circumstance if capable of being remedied or to replace the non-conforming 
Receivable. 
(ii) 
Replacement will be made for the Outstanding Balance of the Receivable plus accrued and 
unpaid interest and any other amount owed to the Fund until the date on which the relevant 
non-conforming Receivable is replaced. 
In order to proceed with the replacement, the Seller will notify the Management Company 
of the characteristics of the Receivable proposed to be assigned satisfying the Eligibility 
Criteria set forth in section 2.2.2.4.2 of this Additional Information, and having similar 
characteristics to those of the non-conforming Receivable (in terms of purpose, term, 
interest rate and outstanding balance). Once the Management Company has verified that the 
characteristics set forth in section 2.2.2.4.2 of this Additional Information are satisfied and 
after having expressly communicated to the Seller that the Receivables to be assigned 
comply with the Eligibility Criteria (where applicable by reference to the relevant 
assignment date), the Seller shall proceed to replace the affected non-conforming 
Receivable and will assign the new Receivable or Receivables. 
Once a month, the replacement of the Receivables shall be communicated to the CNMV by 
delivering the following documents: (i) via CIFRADOC, a list of Receivables that have 
been assigned to the Fund up to such date, and (ii) a statement by the Management 
Company and signed by the Seller that such Receivables meet all the Eligibility Criteria for 
their assignment to the Fund. 
The replacement of the Receivables shall also be communicated to the Rating Agencies. 
(iii)

except if required by law. 
However, upon the occurrence of an Insolvency Event of the Servicer or in case of indications 
thereof, or liquidation or the replacement of the Servicer, or if the Management Company 
considers it to be reasonably justified, the Management Company may request the Servicer to 
notify the Borrowers and the Insurance Companies of the assignment of the outstanding 
Receivables to the Fund and that the payments derived therefrom will only release the debt if 
payment is made into the Treasury Account opened in the name of the Fund. However, if the 
Servicer has not served the notice to the Borrowers within five (5) Business Days of receipt of the 
request by the Management Company, or in the case that the Servicer is in insolvency proceedings, 
the Management Company itself, either directly or through a new designated servicer or agent, 
may notify the Borrowers and the Insurance Companies. 
3.3.2. 
Receivables assignment terms 
The assignment of the Receivables will be full and unconditional and for the whole of the 
remaining period up to the maturity of each Receivable. 
SCF, as Seller of the Receivables and in accordance with article 348 of the Commercial Code and 
article 1,529 of the Civil Code, will be responsible vis-à-vis to the Fund for the existence and 
lawfulness of the Receivables but will not be responsible for the solvency of the Borrowers. 
The Seller does not assume the risk of non-payment of the Receivables and, therefore, does not 
assume any liability for the payment default by the Borrowers, whether for principal, interest or 
any other amount due under the Loans, nor does it assume the effectiveness of the guarantees or 
security granted as security thereof, if any. Furthermore, the Seller will not in any other manner 
whatsoever guarantee directly or indirectly the success of the transaction, or give any security or 
enter into any repurchase or replacement agreements as regards the Receivables, except as 
described in section 2.2.9 of this Additional Information. 
The Receivables under each Loan comprise the Outstanding Balance of the Receivables due on the 
relevant assignment date and all ordinary interest on each Loan, as well as any rights derived from 
any collateral and any insurance policies (other than motor car insurances) related to the Loans, if 
applicable. 
Specifically, without limitation, the assignment of the Receivables will include all ancillary rights 
in accordance with the provisions of article 1,528 of the Civil Code; thus, it will give the Fund the 
following rights as regards the Loans: 
(i) 
to receive all amounts due to the repayment of principal under the Loans; 
(ii) 
to receive all amounts accrued due to the ordinary interest on the Loans; ordinary interest 
will include the ordinary interest on each of the Loans accrued and unpaid since the last 
interest payment date, prior to or on the date of assignment to the Fund; 
(iii) 
to receive any other amounts, assets or rights that might be received, if applicable, by the 
Seller in the form of the auction price or the amount determined by virtue of a court 
decision, or as a result of the disposal or use of the assets awarded or, as a result of such 


 
 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Additional Information 
 
 
167 
 
enforcements, from the provisional administration and possession of the assets during the 
enforcement proceedings; 
(iv) 
to receive all possible rights or compensations that might result in favour of the Seller, 
payments made by any guarantors, etc., as well as those arising from any right ancillary to 
the Loans, including those derived from the reservation of title and the insurance policies, 
except for motor car insurances since these are not assigned to the Fund as specified in 
section 2.2.2.3(xix) of this Additional Information. 
All of the aforementioned rights will accrue in favour of the Fund (i) in respect of the Initial 
Receivable, from the Date of Incorporation by virtue of the execution of the Sale and Purchase 
Agreement and (ii) with respect to the Additional Receivables, from the Payment Date on which 
the assignment occurs under the Sale and Purchase Agreement, which shall be communicated to 
the CNMV by CIFRADOC. 
Any payments relating to fees for claims of unpaid instalments, fees for subrogation, fees for early 
redemption or cancellation and any other fees (including fees for opening, study and information, 
where appropriate) or expenses will not be assigned to the Fund and will therefore continue to 
correspond to the Seller, SCF. 
The rights of the Fund resulting from the Receivables are linked to the payments made by the 
Borrowers under the Loans and, therefore, are directly affected by the evolution, delays, 
prepayments and any other incident related to such Loans. Bank expenses deriving from the 
collection of payments defaults and expenses deriving from pre-judicial, judicial or contentious 
proceedings will be borne by the Seller, notwithstanding the reimbursement right vis-a-vis the 
Fund provided for in section ¡Error! No se encuentra el origen de la referencia. of the 
Additional Information. 
In order to be able to assign Additional Receivables, the Seller’s latest financial statements shall be 
audited and registered with the CNMV and the auditor’s report shall have no qualification. 
The Seller may be declared insolvent and insolvency of the Seller could affect its contractual 
relationship with the Fund, in accordance with the provisions of the Insolvency Law. 
The assignment of the Receivables cannot be the subject of claw-back other than by an action 
brought by the Seller’s receivers, in accordance with the provisions of the Insolvency Law and 
after proving the existence of fraud in the transaction, as set forth in article 16.4 of Law 5/2015. 
The Seller has its place of business office in Spain. Therefore, and unless proof in the contrary, it is 
presumed that the centre of main interests is Spain. 
In the event that the Seller is declared insolvent, in accordance with the Insolvency Law, the Fund, 
represented by the Management Company, shall have the right of separation with respect to the 
Receivables, on the terms provided in articles 239 and 240 of the Insolvency Law; consequently, 
the Fund shall be entitled to obtain from the insolvent Seller the resulting Receivables amounts 
from the date on which the insolvency is decreed, being those amounts considered Fund’s property 
and must therefore be transferred to the Fund, represented by the Management Company. 
This right of separation would not necessarily extend to the cash received and kept by the insolvent 
Seller on behalf of the Fund before that date, given the essential fungible nature of money. 


 
 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Additional Information

Notwithstanding the above, both the Prospectus and the Deed of Incorporation provide for certain 
mechanism in order to mitigate the aforesaid effects in relation to cash due to its fungible nature as 
detailed in section 3.4.2.1 of the Additional Information. 
Section 3.3.1 above provides that the Seller’s assignment of the Receivables to the Fund shall not 
be notified to the Borrowers, except if required by law. 
Notwithstanding the above, upon the occurrence of an Insolvency Event of the Servicer or in case 
of indications thereof, or liquidation or the replacement of the Servicer, or if the Management 
Company considers it to be reasonably justified, the Management Company may request the 
Servicer to notify the Borrowers and the insurance companies of the assignment of the outstanding 
Receivables to the Fund and that the payments derived therefrom will only release the debt if 
payment is made into the Treasury Account opened in the name of the Fund. However, if the 
Servicer has not served the notice to the Borrowers within five (5) Business Days of receipt of the 
request by the Management Company, or in the case that the Servicer is in insolvency proceedings, 
the Management Company itself, either directly or through a new designated servicer or agent, 
may notify the Borrowers and the insurance companies. 
3.3.3.

The Cash Reserve mitigates the liquidity and credit risk due to payment default under the 
Loans. The Cash Reserve is further described in section 3.4.2.2 of this Additional 
Information. 
(ii) 
Interest Rate Swap Transaction 
The Interest Rate Swap Transaction mitigates part of the interest rate risk arising from the

conditions of the Interest Rate Swap Transaction and the Interest Rate Swap Agreement are 
described in section 3.4.8.1 of this Additional Information. 
The Fund has not entered into and will not enter into any kind of hedging instrument save as 
expressly permitted by article 21 (2) of the EU Securitisation Regulation.

3.4.2.3. 
Subordination of the Notes 
After the occurrence of a Subordination Event, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C 
Notes, the Class D Notes and the Class E Notes will be redeemed sequentially in accordance with 
the Pre-Enforcement Priority of Payments set out in section 3.4.7.2 of the Additional Information 
so that (i) the Class B Notes will not be further redeemed for so long as the Class A Notes have not

of Payments set out in section 3.4.7.3 of the Additional Information. Following such Post-
Enforcement Priority of Payments, redemption of principal of the Class F Notes will occupy the 
fifteenth (15th) place of the Post-Enforcement Priority of Payments. 
3.4.3. 
Risk retention requirement 
3.4.3.1. 
EU Retention Requirement 
SCF, as Originator, will undertake in the Deed of Incorporation to retain, on an ongoing basis, a 
material net economic interest of at least five per cent. (5%) in the securitisation transaction 
described in this Prospectus in accordance with article 6(3)(c) of the EU Securitisation Regulation 
(“the retention of randomly selected exposures, equivalent to not less than 5 % of the nominal 
value of the securitised exposures, where such non-securitised exposures would otherwise have 
been securitised in the securitisation, provided that the number of potentially securitised exposures 


 
 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Additional Information 
 
 
172 
 
is not less than 100 at origination”) and article 7 of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 625/2014 of 13 
March 2014 supplementing CRR by way of regulatory technical standards specifying the 
requirements for investors, sponsors, original lenders and originator institutions relating to 
exposures to transferred credit risk, applicable until the new regulatory technical standards to be 
adopted by the Commission apply, pursuant to article 43(7) of the EU Securitisation Regulation. In 
addition, the Seller has undertaken that the material net economic interest held by it shall not be 
split amongst different types of retainers and shall not be subject to any credit-risk mitigation or 
hedging, in accordance with article 6(1) of the EU Securitisation Regulation. 
The retention option and methodology used to calculate the net economic interest will not change, 
unless such change is required due to exceptional circumstances, in which case such change will be 
appropriately 
disclosed 
to 
Noteholders 
and 
published 
on 
the 
following 
websites: 
https://www.santanderconsumer.com/securitization-spain/ 
and 
https://www.santanderconsumer.com/securitization-spain/?lang=es. 
The Deed of Incorporation will include a representation and warranty and undertaking of the 
Originator as to its compliance with the requirements set out in articles 6(1), 6(2) and 6(3) of the 
EU Securitisation Regulation. In addition to the information set out herein and forming part of this 
Prospectus, the Originator has undertaken to make available materially relevant information to 
investors so that investors are able to verify compliance with article 6 of the EU Securitisation 
Regulation in accordance with article 7 of the EU Securitisation Regulation, as set out in section 
4.2.1 of this Additional Information. In particular, the quarterly reports shall include information 
about the risk retained, including information on which of the modalities of retention has been 
applied pursuant to paragraph 1.(e).(iii) of article 7 of the EU Securitisation Regulation. 
Each prospective investor is required to independently assess and determine the sufficiency of the 
information described above and in this Prospectus generally for the purposes of complying with 
each of the provisions described above and any corresponding implementing measure which may 
be applicable. In addition, each prospective investor should ensure that they comply with the 
implementing provisions in respect of the EU Securitisation Regulation. 
Investors who are uncertain as to the requirements which apply to them in respect of their relevant 
jurisdiction, should seek guidance from their regulator. 
3.4.3.2. 
US Risk Retention 
Section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act amended the Exchange Act to generally require the 
“securitiser” of a “securitisation transaction” to retain at least five per cent. (5%) of the “credit 
risk” of “securitised assets”, as such terms are defined for purposes of that statute, and generally 
prohibit a securitiser from directly or indirectly eliminating or reducing its credit exposure by 
hedging or otherwise transferring the credit risk that the securitiser is required to retain. Final rules 
implementing the statute (as amended, the “U.S. Risk Retention Rules”) came into effect on 24 
December 2016 with respect to non-RMBS securitisations. The U.S. Risk Retention Rules provide 
that the securitiser of an asset backed securitisation is its sponsor. The U.S. Risk Retention Rules 
also provide for certain exemptions from the risk retention obligation that they generally impose. 
The Seller does not intend to retain at least five per cent. (5%) of the credit risk of the Issuer for 
the purposes of the U.S. Risk Retention Rules and the issue of the Notes was not designed to 
comply with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules. The Seller intends to rely on an exemption provided 
for in Section 20 of the U.S. Risk Retention Rules regarding non-U.S. transactions. Such non-U.S. 
transactions must meet certain requirements, including that (1) the transaction is not required to be 
and is not registered under the Securities Act; (2) no more than 10 per cent. of the dollar value (or 


 
 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Additional Information 
 
 
173 
 
equivalent amount in the currency in which the securities are issued) of all classes of securities 
issued in the securitisation transaction are sold or transferred to U.S. persons (in each case, as 
defined in the U.S. Risk Retention Rules) or for the account or benefit of U.S. persons (as defined 
in the U.S. Risk Retention Rules and referred to in this Prospectus as Risk Retention U.S. 
Persons); (3) neither the sponsor nor the issuer is organised under U.S. law or is a branch located 
in the United States of a non-U.S. entity; and (4) no more than 25 per cent. of the underlying 
collateral was acquired from a majority-owned affiliate or branch of the sponsor or issuer 
organised or located in the United States. 
The Seller has advised the Issuer that it has not acquired, and it does not intend to acquire more 
than 25 per cent. of the assets from an affiliate or branch of the Seller or the Issuer that is organised 
or located in the United States. 
Prior to any Notes which are offered and sold by the Issuer being purchased by, or for the account 
or benefit of, any Risk Retention U.S. Person, the purchaser of such Notes shall first disclose to the 
Seller and the Lead Manager that it is a Risk Retention U.S. Person and shall obtain the written 
consent of the Seller (a “U.S. Risk Retention Consent”). Prospective investors should note that 
the definition of “U.S. person” in the U.S. Risk Retention Rules is different from the definition of 
“U.S. person” under Regulation S. The definition of U.S. person in the U.S. Risk Retention Rules 
is excerpted below. Particular attention should be paid to clauses (ii) and (viii), which are different 
from the comparable provisions from Regulation S. 
Under the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, and subject to limited exceptions, “U.S. person” means any 
of the following: 
(i) 
any natural person resident in the United States; 
(ii) 
any partnership or corporation organised or incorporated under the laws of the United 
States; 
(iii) 
any estate of which any executor or administrator is a U.S. person (as defined under any 
other clause of this definition); 
(iv) 
any trust of which any trustee is a U.S. person (as defined under any other clause of this 
definition); 
(v) 
any agency or branch of a foreign entity located in the United States; 
(vi) 
any non-discretionary account or similar account (other than an estate or trust) held by a 
dealer or other fiduciary for the benefit or account of a U.S. person (as defined under any 
other clause of this definition); 
(vii) 
any discretionary account or similar account (other than an estate or trust) held by a dealer 
or other fiduciary organised, incorporated, or (if an individual) resident in the United States; 
and 
(viii) any partnership, corporation, limited liability company, or other organisation or entity if: 
– 
organised or incorporated under the laws of any foreign jurisdiction; and 
– 
formed by a U.S. person principally for the purpose of investing in securities not 
registered under the Securities Act, unless it is organised or incorporated, and 
owned, by accredited investors (as defined in 17 CFR 230.501(a)) who are not 
natural persons, estates or trusts. 
Each holder of a Note or a beneficial interest therein acquired in the initial syndication of the Notes 
on the issue date, by its acquisition of a Note or a beneficial interest in a Note, will be deemed, 
and, in certain circumstances, will be required to represent to the Issuer, the Seller and the Lead 


 
 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Additional Information 
 
 
174 
 
Manager that it (1) either (i) is not a Risk Retention U.S. Person or (ii) it has obtained a U.S. Risk 
Retention Consent, (2) is acquiring such Note or a beneficial interest therein for its own account 
and not with a view to distribute such Note and (3) is not acquiring such Note or a beneficial 
interest therein as part of a scheme to evade the requirements of the U.S. Risk Retention Rules 
(including acquiring such Note through a non-Risk Retention U.S. Person, rather than a Risk 
Retention U.S. Person, as part of a scheme to evade the 10 per cent. Risk Retention U.S. Person 
limitation in the exemption provided for in Section 20 of the U.S. Risk Retention Rules described 
herein). 
The Seller has advised the Issuer that it will not provide a U.S. Risk Retention Consent to any 
investor if such investor's purchase would result in more than 10 per cent. of the dollar value (or 
equivalent amount in the currency in which the securities are issued) (as determined by fair value 
under US GAAP) of all Classes of Notes to be sold or transferred to Risk Retention U.S. Persons 
on the Disbursement Date. 
There can be no assurance that the requirement to request the Seller to give its prior written consent 
to any Notes which are offered and sold by the Issuer being purchased by, or for the account or 
benefit of, any Risk Retention U.S. Person will be complied with or will be made by such Risk 
Retention U.S. Persons. 
There can be no assurance that the exemption provided for in Section 20 of the U.S. Risk Retention 
Rules regarding non-U.S. transactions will be available. No assurance can be given as to whether a 
failure by the Seller to comply with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules (regardless of the reason for such 
failure to comply) may give rise to regulatory action which may adversely affect the Notes or the 
market value of the Notes. 
Failure on the part of the Seller to comply with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules (regardless of the 
reason for such failure to comply) could give rise to regulatory action against the Seller which may 
adversely affect the Notes and the ability of the Seller to perform its obligations under the 
Transaction Documents. Furthermore, a failure by the Seller to comply with the U.S. Risk 
Retention Rules could negatively affect the value and secondary market liquidity of the Notes. 
None of the Arranger, the Lead Manager, the Seller, the Fund or any of their affiliates makes any 
representation to any prospective investor or purchaser of the Notes as to whether the transactions 
described in this Prospectus comply as a matter of fact with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules on the 
issue date or at any time in the future. Investors should consult their own advisors as to the U.S. 
Risk Retention Rules. No predictions can be made as to the precise effects of such matters on any 
investor or otherwise. 
3.4.4. 
Details of any financing of subordinated debt finance 
3.4.4.1. 
Subordinated Loan Agreement 
On the Date of Incorporation, the Management Company, in the name and on behalf of the Fund, 
will enter into a subordinated loan agreement with SCF (the “Subordinated Loan Agreement”) in 
the total amount of FOUR MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY-ONE THOUSAND FOUR 
HUNDRED EUROS (€4,841,400) (the “Subordinated Loan”), which will be used to finance the 
Initial Expenses of the Fund, other than the Pre-Hedge Novation Amount, as well as any accrued 
and unpaid interest of the Initial Receivables as of the Date of Incorporation, and to fund the Cash 
Reserve up to the Initial Cash Reserve Amount in the portion that has not been funded with the 
proceeds arising from the issue of the Class F Notes.  
In the event that, after the payment of the Initial Expenses of the Fund (including, if applicable, the 
Pre-Hedge Novation Amount) and the issue of the Notes there is any amount corresponding to the 


 
 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Additional Information 
 
 
175 
 
Subordinated Loan remaining, such remaining amount will be deemed to form part of the 
Available Funds. 
The Subordinated Loan Agreement will be terminated in the event that (i) the provisional credit 
ratings of the Rated Notes are not confirmed as final (unless they are upgraded) by the Rating 
Agencies on or prior to the disbursement of the Notes; or (ii) if the Management, Placement and 
Subscription Agreement is terminated in accordance with the provisions of section 4.2.3 of the 
Securities Note, except for the Initial Expenses for the incorporation of the Fund and the issue of 
the Notes. 
The amount of the Subordinated Loan will be credited to the Treasury Account before 12.00 CET 
on the Disbursement Date. 
The Subordinated Loan will accrue an annual interest, calculated on a quarterly basis, for each 
Interest Accrual Period, which will be equal to the 3 (three) month EURIBOR plus 3.36% (the 
“Subordinated Loan Interest Rate”). In the event that the Subordinated Loan Interest Rate is 
negative, such interest will be equal to zero per cent (0.00%). 
The Subordinated Loan Interest Rate will be paid on each Payment Date and will be calculated on 
the basis of: (i) the actual days existing in each Interest Accrual Period, and (ii) a year of three 
hundred and sixty (360) days. 
The Subordinated Loan Interest Rate will be repaid on each Payment Date provided that the Fund 
has sufficient Available Funds in accordance with the Pre-Enforcement Priority of Payments 
established in section 3.4.7.2 of this Additional Information, or, where applicable, in accordance 
with the Post-Enforcement Priority of Payments described in section 3.4.7.3 of this Additional 
Information.  
Interest due and not paid on a Payment Date will accumulate and accrue interest at the same rate as 
the nominal interest rate of the Subordinated Loan and will be paid, provided that the Fund has 
sufficient Available Funds on the immediately following Payment Date in accordance with the 
Pre-Enforcement Priority of Payments established in section 3.4.7.2 of this Additional Information, 
or, where applicable, with the Post-Enforcement Priority of Payments described in section 3.4.7.3 
of this Additional Information. 
The Subordinated Loan will be repaid on the First Payment Date with Available Funds and in 
accordance with the Pre-Enforcement Priority of Payments established in section 3.4.7.2 of this 
Additional Information. For clarification purposes, if the Subordinated Loan has not been repaid in 
full on the First Payment Date, from the second Payment Date (included) the Subordinated Loan 
will be repaid with the remaining Available Funds after the positions (1) to (13) of the Pre-
Enforcement Priority of Payments have been paid in preference. 
The Subordinated Loan is of subordinated nature, such the interest and principal owed to the 
Subordinated Loan Provider will be postponed in ranking to the rest of creditors of the Fund (other 
than, in certain circumstances, the Swap Counterparty) in accordance with the terms of sections 
3.4.7.2 and 3.4.7.3 of this Additional Information, including, but not limited to, the Noteholders. 
Each of the Fund and the Seller expressly and irrevocably waives any right of set-off against each 
other that could otherwise correspond to it by virtue of any agreement entered into between them.

3.4.4.2. 
Seller Loan 
Following the occurrence of a Regulatory Call Event and provided that the Seller has exercised the 
right to request the Management Company to redeem in full (but not in part) the Class B Notes, the 
Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes (while the Class A 
Notes and the Cash Reserve shall not be redeemed), the Seller shall advance to the Fund a loan 
(the “Seller Loan”), for an amount equal to the Seller Loan Advance Amount. The Seller Loan 
shall be applied by the Fund to redeem in full (but not in part) the Class B Notes, the Class C 
Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes in accordance with section 
4.9.2.3. of the Securities Note. The Seller Loan shall accrue a maximum annual interest of 1.42%. 
The Seller Loan shall be repaid in accordance with the Pre-Enforcement Priority of Payment set 
forth in section 3.4.7.2.3(B) of the Additional Information and the Post- Enforcement Priority of 
Payment described in section 3.4.7.3.3 of the Additional Information. 
On or after the Regulatory Call Early Redemption Date, the parties to the Transaction Documents 
shall take all necessary actions to amend the Transaction Documents, (provided that no 
modification, waiver and/or additions is materially prejudicial to the interests of the holders of the 
Class A Notes) in order to achieve in respect of such parties (other than, for the avoidance of 
doubt, the Seller) an equivalent economic effect under the Transaction Documents as on the date 
immediately prior to the Regulatory Call Early Redemption Date. 
3.4.5. 
Specification of any investment parameter for the investment of temporary liquidity 
surpluses and description of the parties responsible for the said investment 
3.4.5.1. 
Fund Accounts 
On the Date of Incorporation, the Management Company, acting for and on behalf of the Fund, 
will enter into a reinvestment agreement (the “Reinvestment Agreement”) with SCF (the “Fund 
Accounts Provider”) in order to carry out the opening, maintenance and operation of the 
following bank accounts (the “Fund Accounts”): 
(i) 
the Treasury Account; 
(ii) 
the Principal Account; and 
(iii) 
the Swap Collateral Account; 
(each as defined below) according to the terms and conditions set out in the Reinvestment 
Agreement. 
On the Disbursement Date and until a change on its remuneration has occurred, as described on the 
paragraph below, the amounts deposited in the Treasury Account and the Principal Account will 
not accrue, in principle, any interest. 
The amounts deposited in the Swap Collateral Account will accrue interest at a rate equal to the 
daily €STR. However, in the event that such rate falls below 0 (zero), the applicable interest will 
be equal to zero per cent (0.00%).  
Notwithstanding the above, under the Reinvestment Agreement these accounts can change its 
remuneration, in which case the new interest rate will be reported by SCF or the Management 
Company to the rest of the parties (including the Rating Agencies). If the remuneration is negative 
this will be considered a Fund expense. 


 
 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Additional Information

SCF will not guarantee an interest on the amounts credited by the Fund, through its Management 
Company, to the Fund Accounts. 
For the purposes of this Prospectus, “€STR” means, in respect of an interest accrual period in 
respect of the balances standing to the credit on the Swap Collateral Account, the euro short-term 
rate equal to the overnight rate as calculated by the ECB and appearing on the relevant screen page 
two (2) Business Days before the date on which such interest accrual period begins. In case €STR 
ceases to be provided permanently or indefinitely, any mention to that reference rate shall be 
understood as made to the rate (inclusive of any spreads or adjustments) recommended by the ECB 
(or any successor administrator) in replacement of the €STR as published or provided by the 
administrator thereof. 
3.4.5.1.1

Pursuant to the Reinvestment Agreement the amounts to be credited in the treasury account 
(the “Treasury Account”) will include, but are not limited to, the following: 
(i) 
On the Disbursement Date:

the effective subscription price of the Notes issued; and 
(b) 
the amount drawdown under the Subordinated Loan for satisfying the Initial 
Expenses for the incorporation of the Fund and the issue of the Notes, as well as any 
accrued and unpaid interest of the Initial Receivables as of the Date of Incorporation. 
(ii) 
On any other date: 
(a) 
principal and interests on the Receivables; 
(b) 
any other amounts corresponding to the Receivables, and to the disposal or use of 
assets awarded as a consequence of enforcement or repossession proceedings, or 
under provisional administration and possession of the assets during enforcement or 
repossession proceedings, as well as all possible rights and compensations, including 
those derived from any ancillary right to the Receivables, including, if applicable, 
those derived from reservation of title and insurance compensations, but excluding 
fees; 
(c) 
the amount which constitutes the Cash Reserve at any time, as described in section 
3.4.2.2 of this Additional Information; 
(d) 
if applicable, any interest accrued from the balances credited in the Treasury 
Account and the Principal Account;

in section 2.2.9 of the Additional Information; 
(f) 
the amounts which, as the case may be, may be paid to the Fund by the Swap 
Counterparty under the Interest Rate Swap Transaction (other than any cash 
collateral to be transferred by the Swap Counterparty under the CSA and deposited 
in the Swap Collateral Account); and 
(g) 
the amounts, if any, of interim withholdings on the return on investments to be 
effected on each relevant Payment Date on the Note interest paid by the Fund, until

178 
 
(i) 
On the Disbursement Date: 
(a) 
the purchase price of the Initial Receivables in accordance with section 3.3.3(i) of 
the Additional Information,  
(b) 
the Initial Expenses for the incorporation of the Fund and the issue of the Notes 
(provided that payments of the Initial Expenses will be made, as soon as each 
expense becomes due and payable). 
(ii) 
On each Payment Date, the Available Funds will be applied in accordance with the Pre-
Enforcement Priority of Payments or the Post-Enforcement Priority of Payments, as 
applicable. 
On the Disbursement Date and until a change on its remuneration has occurred, as described 
above, the amounts deposited in the Treasury Account will accrue no interest, in accordance with 
the Reinvestment Agreement. 
3.4.5.1.2 
Principal Account 
Pursuant to the Reinvestment Agreement, the account identified as the principal account (the 
“Principal Account”), following the instructions of the Management Company, will be credited 
on each Payment Date, only during the Revolving Period, with an amount equal to the Principal 
Target Redemption Amount at least one (1) Business Day prior to the relevant Payment Date. 
Subject to the paragraph below, following the instructions of the Management Company, the 
amounts held at the Principal Account will be considered Available Funds and will be applied, on 
each Payment Date during the Revolving Period, towards making the payments envisaged in, and 
in accordance with, item (10) of the Pre-Enforcement Priority of Payments, as described in section 
3.4.7.2.2 of the Additional Information (or, if applicable, towards making the payments envisaged 
in, and in accordance with, item (6) of section 3.4.7.2.3(B) of the Additional Information). 
Consequently, provided that there are sufficient Available Funds during the Revolving Period, 
following the instructions of the Management Company, the Principal Target Redemption Amount 
will be applied in order to pay first, out of the amounts deposited in the Principal Account, the

Company, all amounts standing to the credit in the Principal Account will be transferred to the 
Treasury Account. 
Subject to a change in its remuneration, the amounts deposited in the Principal Account shall

In case of a change in its remuneration, following the instructions of the Management Company, 
any amounts received by the Fund as interest accrued on the balances credited on the Principal 
Account will be transferred to the Treasury Account forthwithly upon receipt thereof without need 
to apply it in accordance with the paragraphs above.

Additional Information and in the Interest Rate Swap Agreement (including, without limitation, 
the CSA).  
In the event that the Swap Counterparty should transfer any Eligible Credit Support (as defined in 
the CSA) to the Fund in connection with the Interest Rate Swap Agreement, the Fund shall hold 
such Eligible Credit Support in the Swap Collateral Account which shall be segregated from the 
Treasury Account, from the Principal Account and from the general cash flow of the Fund.

Available Funds for the Fund to make payments in accordance with the Pre-Enforcement Priority 
of Payments or the Post-Enforcement Priority of Payments but may be applied in accordance with 
the following provisions by, or on behalf of, the Fund as follows: 
(i)

(a) 
first, payment of any negative interest rates and fees accrued on the funds deposited 
in the Swap Collateral Account; and 
(b) 
second, payment or discharge of any “Return Amounts”, “Interest Amounts”, 
“Distributions” (each as defined in the credit support annex forming part of the 
Interest Rate Swap Agreement (the “CSA”)) owed to the Swap Counterparty;

following the designation of a Swap Early Termination Date, where the Swap Termination 
Amount is payable by the Fund to the Swap Counterparty: 
(a) 
first, in or towards payment of any Swap Termination Amount due to the Swap 
Counterparty; and 
(b) 
second, where the Swap Termination Amount is discharged, the surplus of any 
amounts standing to the Swap Collateral Account (if any) is to be transferred to the 
Treasury Account to be applied as Available Funds; and 
(iii) 
following the designation of a Swap Early Termination Date, where the Swap Termination 
Amount is payable by the Swap Counteparty to the Fund, amounts standing to the Swap 
Collateral Account (if any) are permitted to be transferred to the Treasury Account to be 
applied as Available Funds. 
In the event that the Fund Accounts Provider defaults in its obligations under the Reinvestment 
Agreement and due to such default the Fund is not able to immediately apply the collateral 
amounts held on such account towards any payment due to the Swap Counterparty, the amount 
payable by the Fund to the Swap Counterparty shall be paid according to the Pre-Enforcement 
Priority of Payments or the Post-Enforcement Priority of Payments, as applicable. 
3.4.5.1.4 
Termination of the Reinvestment Agreement  
The Reinvestment Agreement shall be in force until the earlier of the following: (i) the Legal 
Maturity Date, or (ii) the the date in which the Management Company or SCF carry out the Early 
Liquidation of the Fund or the cancellation of the Fund, pursuant to sections 4.4.3 and 4.4.4 of the 
Registration Document. 
Furthermore, the Reinvestment Agreement will be early terminated if the Fund Accounts Provider 
resigns or is substituted as provided below:

The Fund Accounts Provider (or the replacing entity in which the Fund Accounts are 
opened) may, at any time, terminate the Reinvestment Agreement by giving at least ninety 
(90) calendar days' prior written notice to the Management Company. 
In such case, the Management Company will appoint a new Fund’s account bank (a “New 
Fund Accounts Provider”), provided that the following conditions are met (the “Fund 
Accounts Provider Substitution Requirements”): 
(a) 
The New Fund Accounts Provider: 
(I) 
is a credit institution duly authorised to provide banking services in Spain; 
(II) 
it has at least the following credit ratings:  
- 
the Moody’s Minimum Rating, and

the Fitch Minimum Rating. 
(III) 
has, in the Management Company’s opinion, extensive experience and a 
proven operational track record in functions similar to those described in this 
Agreement; 
(IV) 
in the Management Company’s opinion can assume in substance the rights 
and obligations of the Fund Accounts Provider; and 
(V) 
shall have agreed with the Management Company to perform the duties and

regulations. 
(ii)

The Management Company may, at any time, substitute at its sole discretion the Fund 
Accounts Provider by giving at least thirty (30) calendar days prior notice to the Fund 
Accounts Provider and provided that the Fund Accounts Provider Substitution 
Requirements are met. 
Neither the voluntary termination of the Reinvestment Agreement by the Fund Accounts Provider 
nor by the Management Company will be effective until the new institution assuming the position 
of Fund Accounts Provider has effectively resumed functions.  
The costs and taxes derived from the termination of the Reinvestment Agreement by the Fund 
Accounts Provider will be borne by the latter. However. if the Reinvesmtnet Agreement is 
terminated following the voluntary substitution by the Management Company, all costs will be 
borne by the Fund and will be considered Extraordinary Expenses of the Fund. The resignation or 
substitution of the Fund Accounts Provider, as well as the appointment of the New Fund Accounts 
Provider will be notified by the Management Company to the Rating Agencies and the CNMV. 
3.4.5.1.5 
Rating Agencies Criteria for the Fund Accounts Provider 
In the event that rating of SCF or of the replacing entity in which the Fund Accounts are opened, 
should, at any time during the life of the Notes issue, be downgraded: 


 
 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Additional Information 
 
 
181 
 
(i) 
below the long-term bank deposit rating of at least A3 according to Moody’s (the 
“Moody’s Minimum Rating”); or 
(ii) 
below (a) the long-term deposit rating, if available, a long-term senior debt rating of A- and 
(b) a short-term senior deposit rating, if available, a short-term senior debt rating of F1 
assigned by Fitch (each a “Fitch Minimum Rating”); 
the Management Company, in order for the ratings given to the Rated Notes by the Rating 
Agencies to be not adversely affected, shall within sixty (60) calendar days from the day of the 
occurrence of any of the abovementioned events, transfer the Fund Accounts to an institution: 
• 
with at least a Moody’s Minimum Rating; and/or 
• 
with at least a Fitch Minimum Rating; 
and, the Management Company will arrange the highest possible return for the balance of the Fund 
Accounts, which may be lower, equal to or higher than that arranged with the Fund Accounts 
Provider (or the replacing entity in which the Fund Accounts are opened). 
In this regard, the Fund Accounts Provider (or the replacing entity in which the Fund Accounts are 
opened) shall irrevocably agree to notify the Management Company of any change or removal of 
its rating given by the Rating Agencies, forthwith upon that occurrence throughout the life of the 
Rated Notes. 
All costs, expenses and taxes incurred due to the execution and formalisation of the previous 
options will be borne by SCF or, if applicable, by the subsequent holder of the Fund Accounts. 
3.4.6. 
How payments are collected in respect of the Receivables 
The Servicer, as collection agent on behalf of the Fund, will collect any amounts for both principal 
and interest under the Loans paid by the Borrowers, as well as any other amounts corresponding to 
the Fund, and will proceed to immediately deposit such amounts into the Treasury Account within 
two (2) Business Days from their receipt. 
The Servicer will not pay, in any case, any amount to the Fund that the Servicer has not previously 
received from the Borrowers in respect of the Loans. 
3.4.6.1. 
Powers of the holder of the Receivables in the case of breach by the Borrower or the Servicer of 
their obligations 
SCF, as Servicer of the Receivables, will apply the same level of expertise, diligence and 
procedures for the recovery of any amounts due and unpaid under the Receivables as it applies for 
the rest of loans contained in its portfolio. In particular, once the relevant periods for out-of court 
actions to obtain payment of unpaid amounts under the Receivables have elapsed without having 
recovered the relevant unpaid amounts, the Servicer will bring any relevant legal actions for such 
purposes. In any case, the Servicer will bring the aforementioned legal actions if, after having 
analysed the specific circumstances of the case, the Management Company, on behalf of the Fund 
in agreement with the Servicer, deems it appropriate. 
The current recovery actions that SCF is applying are described in section 2.2.7.3 (Recovery 
Process) of the Additional Information. 
In the case of payment default under the Loans, the out-of-court and court actions described in this 
section will be initiated for the purposes of obtaining payment of any amounts due or recovering 
the financed Vehicles, as applicable. 


 
 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Additional Information 
 
 
182 
 
3.4.6.1.1 
Action against the Servicer 
The Management Company, for and on behalf of the Fund, may take action against the Servicer 
where the breach of the obligation to pay principal or interest amounts and/or any other amounts 
due under the Loans by the Borrowers does not result from default by the Borrowers and is 
attributable to the Servicer. 
The Servicer will not be liable in case that such breach is caused by the Servicer’s compliance with 
the servicing provisions or the instructions given by the Management Company. 
3.4.6.1.2 
Actions in case of payment default under the Loans 
The Management Company, on behalf of the Fund, may take all legal actions derived from the 
ownership of the Receivables, in accordance with the legislation in force. 
For the above purposes, the Management Company as entity responsible for servicing and 
managing the Receivables pursuant to article 26.1.b) of Law 5/2015, shall grant in the Deed of 
Incorporation a power of attorney as broad as permitted by law in favour of the Servicer so that the 
latter, acting through any of its duly authorised attorneys, as instructed by the Management 
Company, may claim any Borrower (and if applicable any guarantor) in or out of court the 
payment of any amounts due under the Receivables and take legal actions against them, in addition 
to any other powers required for the performance of its duties as Servicer. These powers may also 
be granted under a separate document from the Deed of Incorporation or may be expanded and 
modified, if necessary, for the performance of such duties. 
Additionally, the Servicer undertakes to inform the Management Company, on behalf of the Fund, 
on a quarterly basis, of any payment defaults, early repayments and adjustments of the interest 
rates and maturity, and to provide timely information regarding payment demands, certified notices 
given to the Borrowers or guarantors, legal actions, and any other circumstances affecting the 
Loans or the Receivables. Furthermore, the Servicer will provide the Management Company with 
all the documents that the latter might request in relation to the Loans and, in particular, the 
documents that the Management Company might need for the purposes of bringing any legal 
actions. 
The Servicer shall, as a general rule, commence the relevant legal proceedings if, within six (6) 
months, (i) the Borrower in default of its payments obligations fails to resume payments, or (ii) the 
Servicer with the Management Company’s consent, fails to obtain a payment undertaking 
satisfactory to the interests of the Fund. 
3.4.6.1.3 
Special consideration relating to the reservations of title 
As explained in section 2.2. of the Additional Information, the reservation of title provisions may 
be documented either by virtue of a public deed (póliza) granted before a public notary, or by 
means of a private document in an official form, and may be registered or not in the Register of 
Instalment Sales of Movable Properties (and therefore in the Vehicles Register of the Spanish 
General Traffic Directorate). 
As provided in article 16.5 of Law 28/1998, any reservation of title documented in a public deed 
(póliza) granted before a public notary or by means of an official form, registered in the 
corresponding Register of Instalment Sales of Movable Properties, grants its beneficiary, the 
preference and priority set forth in (i) article 1,922.2 of the Civil Code, by virtue of which, with 
regard to certain movable properties of the debtor, credits guaranteed with a pledge have 
preference over the asset pledged up to the value thereof, and (ii) article 1,926.1 of the Civil Code, 
by virtue of which, if two or more credits compete with respect to certain movable properties, and 


 
 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Additional Information 
 
 
183 
 
as regards the order of priority for their payment, the secured credit excludes the rest of credits up 
to the value of the asset pledged. 
Any reservation of title documented by virtue of a public deed (póliza) granted before a public 
notary will serve as an enforceable instrument in compliance with the provisions of article 517.2 of 
the Civil Procedural Law for the purpose of the recovery of the relevant vehicle. 
Likewise, in the case of breach of a reservation of title clause registered in the Register of 
Instalment Sales of Movable Properties, the Servicer may act directly and exclusively against the 
vehicle, according to the procedure specified in article 16.2 of Law 28/1998, and the credit rights 
derived from the same will correspond in any case to the Fund, except for those amounts that had 
not been assigned to the Fund in accordance with the provisions of this Prospectus and the Deed of 
Incorporation. Therefore, in accordance with such article 16.2 of the Law 28/1998, the creditor 
may act directly and exclusively against the vehicle, according to the following procedure: 
(i) 
The creditor, through a public notary competent to act in the place where the assets are 
located, where the payment is to be made or in the place of residence of the borrower, will 
demand payment from the borrower, by stating the total amount claimed and the cause of 
the maturity of the obligation. Similarly, the borrower will be warned that, in the event that 
the borrower fails to comply with the obligation, the creditor will proceed to act against the 
goods purchased in instalments pursuant to the provisions of such article 16.2 of the Law 
28/1998. Unless otherwise agreed, the liquid amount which is payable in the case of 
enforcement will be the amount specified in the certification issued by the creditor, 
provided that it has been verified, through a public notary, that the liquidation has been 
performed in the manner agreed by the parties under the contract and that the balance 
coincides with the balance appearing in the account opened for the borrower. 
(ii) 
The borrower, within three (3) business days following the date on which the debtor 
received such demand, will pay the amount demanded or will deliver the possession of the 
assets to the creditor or to the person designated by the creditor in the demand for payment. 
(iii) 
If the borrower fails to pay, but voluntarily delivers the possession of the assets purchased 
in instalments, such assets will be sold at a public auction, with the intervention of a public 
notary. 
(iv) 
At the said auction, the rules established in article 1,872 of the Civil Code and any 
complementary provisions will be observed, as they may apply, as well as the standards 
regulating the professional activity of public notaries. At the first auction, the value will be 
that established for that purpose by the parties in the relevant contract. Notwithstanding the 
provisions of the preceding paragraphs, the creditor may opt for the adjudication of the 
assets as payment of the amount due without the need to attend the public auction. In this 
case, the provisions of item e) of this section will apply. 
(v) 
Should the borrower fail to pay the amount claimed and to deliver the possession of the 
assets for their sale at a public auction (referred to in the previous item), the creditor may 
request from the competent court the summary protection of its rights, by means of the 
exercise of the actions established in items 10 and 11 of the first section of article 250 of the 
Civil Procedural Law. 
(vi) 
The acquisition by the creditor of the assets delivered by the borrower will not prevent the 
claim between the parties for the corresponding amounts, if the value of the assets at the 
time of their delivery by the borrower, according to the reference tables or indexes of 
depreciation established in the relevant contract, is lower or higher than the debt claimed. 


 
 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Additional Information 
 
 
184 
 
In the event that no procedure for the calculation of the depreciation of such assets has been 
agreed, the creditor must justify such depreciation in the corresponding ordinary declaratory 
proceedings. 
In the event that the assets sold with a reservation of title clause or a prohibition against disposal, 
which is registered in the Register of Instalment Sales of Movable Properties, are in the possession 
of a person other than the original buyer, such person will be required, through a public notary, to 
pay the amount claimed or to surrender the assets within three (3) Business Days. 
If such person proceeds to pay, he/she/it will be subrogated in place of the satisfied creditor against 
the original buyer. If such person surrenders the assets, all the formalities of the enforcement, 
whether before a public notary or by judicial means, will be handled over him/her/it and the 
remainder that might result after the payment to the plaintiff will be delivered to him/her/it. If the 
person in possession of the assets fails to pay or to surrender such assets, the provisions of item d) 
and the following ones of the previous section will apply. 
With regard to the reservations of title under a private agreement and not registered in the Register 
of Instalment Sales of Movable Properties, the recognition of the right to recover the vehicle 
involved, in favour of the Servicer and in the interest of the Fund, will be determined by means of 
the appropriate declaratory proceedings. This can take significantly longer that if the Loan 
agreement is notarised and/or registered (no less than one year and a half, but it could take up to 
2/3 years to finalize the proceeding if there are appeals – even more depending on the court 
workload). 
In light of the above, in the event that the reservation of title clause is registered in the Register of 
Instalment Sales of Movable Properties, in case of payment default of the financed amount, the 
Servicer may choose between: (a) termination of the agreement, which will be been effected by an 
ordinary action of declaration, or an oral proceeding according to the amount of the demand; this 
action will have the purpose of terminating the agreement and obtaining the immediate delivery of 
the vehicle to the Servicer (article 250.1.11º of the Civil Procedural Law), or (b) compliance 
action, whereby the Servicer will try the reinstatement of the credit, by executing an ordinary 
action of declaration, payment procedure, or an action for enforcement, in this process the vehicle 
which bears the reservation of title may be seized (article 250.1.10º of the Civil Procedural Law). 
That enforcement process may be started directly by the Servicer if: 
(i) 
The Loan has been documented in a deed granted before a public notary is considered as an 
enforceable title according to article 517.2 of the Civil Procedural Law. Such enforceable 
action will entail the submission of a lawsuit, to which the Borrower can oppose in certain 
cases, and the subsequent resolution of the court ordering the seizure of the assets 
(including the vehicle). 
(ii) 
If the Loan has not been documented in a deed granted before a public notary, the Servicer 
may start a proceeding for the recognition of his right over the payment of the credit prior to 
starting an enforceable action against the assets of the Borrower. Such declaration 
proceeding will start with submission of a lawsuit and the reply of the Borrower. After this, 
there will be a preliminary hearing were all the formal or procedural issues will be 
discussed and it is the moment where the parties request the means of proof. The next step 
will be the trial where the witnesses and experts pose their arguments and will conclude 
with the court ruling. In the event that the ruling was in favour of the Servicer, if the 
borrower does not comply with the obligations of the ruling, the Servicer will be able to 
request the enforcement of the ruling and the corresponding seizure of the assets (including 
the vehicle).

As indicated, the assignment of the Receivables to the Fund comprises in all cases the assignment 
of the rights conferred by the reservation title clauses. In this regards, the Order of July 19, 1999, 
approving the Regulation for the Register of Instalment Sales of Movable Properties (Orden de 19 
de julio de 1999 por la que se aprueba la Ordenanza para el Registro de Venta a Plazos de Bienes 
Muebles), provides that it is possible to register the assignments carried out by the lender to a third 
party of its right vis-à-vis the buyer. In particular, article 21 expressly provides for the assignment 
of the rights entered into in favour of a securitisation fund in the event of securitisation of loans 
guaranteed by a reservation title. Notwithstanding, and with regards to the Fund, it has been agreed 
that the assignment of the rights deriving from the reservation title clauses will not be registered 
with the Register of Instalment Sales of Movable Properties in the name of the Fund as long as the 
Seller continues to be the Servicer. If the Seller ceases to act as the Servicer of the Receivables, the 
new servicer will be entitled (but not obliged) to register the assignment of the rights conferred by 
the reservation of titles clauses in favour of the Fund. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any case, any rights, payments and compensations obtained as a 
result of the enforcement of a reservations of title provision will correspond to the Fund, except for 
those amounts that were not assigned to the Fund in accordance with the provisions of this 
Prospectus and which will therefore correspond to the Seller.

3.4.8.1. 
Interest Rate Swap Agreement 
3.4.8.1.1 
General 
On the Date of Incorporation, the Management Company, on behalf of the Fund, shall enter into an 
International Swaps and Derivatives Association 1992 Master Agreement (Multicurrency – Cross 
Border), together with the relevant Schedule, the CSA and the confirmation evidencing the Interest 
Rate Swap Transaction thereunder with the Swap Counterparty (the “Interest Rate Swap 
Agreement”), in order to hedge the potential interest rate exposure of the Fund in relation to its 
floating rate interest obligations under the Floating Rate Notes and the fixed nature of the interest 
rate payable under the Receivables. The Interest Rate Swap Agreement incorporates the 2006 
ISDA Definitions, including Supplement no. 70 thereto, which provides for the application of 
certain fall-back rates to the Interest Rate Swap Transaction instead of EURIBOR in certain 
circumstances. 
The Interest Rate Swap Transaction will remain in full force and effect until the earlier of (i) the 
Legal Maturity Date; and (ii) the date on which the Notional Amount is reduced to zero, unless it is 
terminated early by one of the parties thereto in accordance with the terms of the Interest Rate 
Swap Agreement.  
The Interest Rate Swap Transaction shall be fully terminated if the Management and Subscription 
Agreement is fully terminated in accordance with the provisions of section 4.2.3 of the Securities 
Note or if the provisional credit ratings of the Rated Notes are not confirmed as final (unless such 
provisional ratings are upgraded) by the Rating Agencies on or prior to the Disbursement Date. 
In the event that the Interest Rate Swap Transaction is terminated by either party, the amount 
determined pursuant to Section 6(e) of the Interest Rate Swap Agreement in Euro may be due to 
the Fund or to the Swap Counterparty in accordance with the provisions thereof. 
3.4.8.1.2 
Notional amount 
Subject to the remainder of this section 3.4.8.1.2, the notional amount of the Interest Rate Swap 
Transaction (the “Notional Amount”) will be calculated by reference to the Outstanding Balance 
of the Non-Defaulted Receivables (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the Outstanding Balance 
of the Defaulted Receivables).  
For the first Swap Payment Date, the Notional Amount shall be equal to the Outstanding Balance 
of the Receivables on the Disbursement Date.   
For any Swap Payment Date occurring during Revolving Period (excluding the first Swap Payment 
Date) and for the first Swap Payment Date after the end of the Revolving Period, the Notional 


 
 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Additional Information 
 
 
194 
 
Amount shall be equal to the Outstanding Balance of the Non-Defaulted Receivables (excluding, 
for the avoidance of doubt, the Outstanding Balance of the Defaulted Receivables) on the Swap 
Payment Date falling prior to the relevant Swap Calculation Period. 
For any Swap Payment Date occurring after the Revolving Period End Date (excluding the first 
Swap Payment Date after the end of the Revolving Period), the Notional Amount shall be equal to 
the Outstanding Balance of the Non-Defaulted Receivables (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, 
the Outstanding Balance of the Defaulted Receivables) on the Determination Date inmediately 
preceding the relevant Swap Calculation Period. 
3.4.8.1.3 
Pre-hedge 
On 3 August 2022 (the “Pre-Hedge Transaction Date”), the Seller and the Swap Counterparty 
entered into a confirmation evidencing an interest rate swap transaction in order to fix the 
maximum interest rate that the Fund will be obliged to pay under the Interest Rate Swap 
Transaction (the “Pre-Hedge Transaction”) at a rate equal to 1.585% (the “Pre-Hedge Rate”).  
On the Date of Incorporation, the Pre-Hedge Transaction will be transferred by way of novation by 
the Seller to the Fund following the entry into of a novation agreement in respect of such Pre-
Hedge Transaction on the Date of Incorporation, and such Pre-Hedge Transaction as novated will 
be part of and governed by the Interest Rate Swap Agreement. If, on the Date of Incorporation, the 
mark-to-market value of the Pre-Hedge Transaction is positive for the Seller (i.e., if the floating 
part of the swap payable by the Swap Counterparty is higher than the fixed part of the swap 
payable by the Seller), the Fund will pay in favour of the Seller an amount equal to the mark-to-
market value of the Pre-Hedge Transaction as of the Date of Incorporation (the “Pre-Hedge 
Novation Amount”) as a compensation for the novation of the Pre-Hedge Transaction from the 
Seller to the Fund. The Pre-Hedge Novation Amount (if any) will be considered an Initial Expense 
and will be paid out of the proceeds of the issue of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class 
C Notes, the Class D Notes and the Class E Notes.  
Additionally, the Seller had the option to reduce the fixed interest rate payable by it to a rate lower 
than the Pre-Hedge Rate in case that, on the date falling two (2) Business Days before the Date of 
Incorporation (the “Exercise Date”), the market conditions applicable to the Pre-Hedge 
Transaction were more favourable than those applicable on the Pre-Hedge Transaction Date.  
3.4.8.1.4 
Payments under the Interest Rate Swap Transaction 
For each Swap Calculation Period falling prior to the termination date of the Interest Rate Swap 
Transaction, the following amounts will be calculated by the Swap Calculation Agent in respect of 
the Interest Rate Swap Transaction: 
(i) 
an amount equal to a fixed interest rate which will be equal to 1.585%:  
(a) 
multiplied by the Notional Amount, 
(b) 
divided by a count fraction of 360, and  
(c) 
multiplied by the number of days of the relevant Swap Calculation Period (the 
“Fund Swap Amount”); and  
(ii) 
an amount equal to a floating rate of EURIBOR 3 month (or, in respect of the first Swap 
Calculation Period, the rate determined through the use of straight-line interpolation of 
EURIBOR 1 month and EURIBOR 3 month): 


 
 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Additional Information 
 
 
195 
 
(a) 
multiplied by the Notional Amount from time to time,  
(b) 
divided by a count fraction of 360, and  
(c) 
multiplied by the number of days of the relevant Swap Calculation Period (the 
“Swap Counterparty Amount”). 
If EURIBOR 3 months (or, in respect of the first Swap Calculation Period, such 
interpolated rate) is below zero (0), no floor will be applied and the absolute value of the 
relevant negative amount will form part of the Fund Swap Amount. 
After these two amounts are calculated in relation to a Swap Payment Date, the following 
payments will be made on that Swap Payment Date: 
(i) 
if the Swap Counterparty Amount for that Swap Payment Date is greater than the Fund 
Swap Amount for that relevant Swap Payment Date, then the Swap Counterparty will pay 
an amount equal to the excess to the Fund;  
(ii) 
if the Fund Swap Amount for that Swap Payment Date is greater than the Swap 
Counterparty Amount for that relevant Swap Payment Date, then the Fund will pay an 
amount equal to the excess to the Swap Counterparty; and  
(iii) 
if the two amounts are equal, neither party will make a payment to the other. 
If, in accordance with the Interest Rate Swap Transaction: 
(i) 
the Swap Counterparty is obliged to make any payments in favour of the Fund, such 
payments will be made into the Treasury Account; and 
(ii) 
the Fund is obliged to make any payments in favour of the Swap Counterparty, the 
Management Company, on behalf of the Fund, will apply the Available Funds towards 
payment of such amounts in accordance with the Pre-Enforcement Priority of Payments or 
the Post-Enforcement Priority or Payments, as applicable. 
Payments under the Interest Rate Swap Agreement will be made by either the Fund or the Swap 
Counterparty without any withholding or deduction of taxes unless required by law. To the extent 
any party to the Interest Rate Swap Transaction is required to deduct or withhold any amounts, the 
relevant party will, among others things and subject to certain conditions set out in the Interest 
Rate Swap Agreement, gross up such amounts so that the other party receives such additional 
amount as may be necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by the relevant party 
equals the full amount it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been required. 
For the purposes of this Prospectus: 
“Swap Payment Date” means the 20 of December, 20 of March, 20 of June and 20 of September 
of each year commencing on the First Payment Date (which, for the avoidance of doubt, will be 
the first Swap Payment Date) and ending on the termination date of the Interest Rate Swap 
Transaction, in each case subject to adjustment in accordance with the Modified Following 
Business Day Convention as set out in the Interest Rate Swap Agreement. 
“Swap Calculation Period” means (other than the first Swap Calculation Period), each period 
that commences on (and includes) a Swap Payment Date and ends on (but excludes) the 
immediately following Swap Payment Date and in respect of the first Swap Calculation Period, 
means the period commencing on (and including) the Disbursement Date and ending on (but 
excluding) the first Swap Payment Date.

Swap Calculation Agent 
Banco Santander will act as Swap Calculation Agent of the Interest Rate Swap Agreement, subject 
to the terms of the Interest Rate Swap Agreement. 
3.4.8.1.6 
Collateral 
The Interest Rate Swap Agreement will contain provisions requiring certain remedial actions to be 
taken if a Swap Counterparty Downgrade Event occurs in respect of the Swap Counterparty (or, as 
relevant, its guarantor). Such provisions may include a requirement that the Swap Counterparty 
must (i) post collateral; (ii) transfer the Interest Rate Swap Transaction to another entity (or, as 
relevant its guarantor); (iii) procure that a guarantor meeting the applicable credit rating guarantees 
its obligations under the Interest Rate Swap Agreement; and/or (iv) take other actions in 
accordance with the Interest Rate Swap Agreement. 
Where the Swap Counterparty provides collateral in accordance with the provisions of the Interest 
Rate Swap Agreement (including the CSA thereto), such collateral will not form part of the 
Available Funds, save as expressly permitted in the section 3.4.7.2.1 of the Additional Information. 
The Swap Counterparty may only post collateral in the form of cash under the CSA to the Interest 
Rate Swap Agreement and any such cash collateral amounts will be credited to the Swap Collateral 
Account. If the Swap Counterparty does not fulfil its payment obligations under the Interest Rate 
Swap Transaction, which gives rise to a Swap Counterparty Default, upon the termination and 
close-out of the Interest Rate Swap Transaction, any excess collateral amounts will be used in 
accordance with section 3.4.5.1.3 of the Additional Information. 
3.4.8.1.7 
Early Termination 
The Interest Rate Swap Transaction may be early terminated in accordance with its terms, 
irrespective of whether or not the Floating Rate Notes have been paid in full prior to such 
termination, upon the occurrence of certain events envisaged therein (which may include without 
limitation): 
(i) 
certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or reorganisation of the Swap 
Counterparty or the Early Liquidation of the Fund; 
(ii) 
failure on the part of the Fund or the Swap Counterparty to make any payment when due 
under the Interest Rate Swap Agreement; 
(iii) 
changes in law resulting in illegality; 
(iv) 
amendment of any material terms of the Deed of Incorporation without the prior written 
approval of the Swap Counterparty if such amendments affect the amount, timing and 
priority of any payments due from the Swap Counterparty to the Fund; 
(v) 
occurrence of an Swap Counterparty Downgrade Event that is not remedied within the 
required timeframe pursuant to the Interest Rate Swap Agreement; 
(vi) 
if at any time the reference rate in respect of the Floating Rate Notes is changed (including 
where it is fixed in the scenario contemplated by paragraph (viii) of section 4.8.4 (Fall-back 
provisions) of the Securities Note) and, as a result, it is different to the relevant reference 
rate applicable to the Interest Rate Swap Transaction, and 
(vii) 
any other event as specified in the Interest Rate Swap Agreement. 


 
 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Additional Information 
 
 
197 
 
A Subordination Event shall be deemed to take place in accordance with section 4.9.2.1 of 
Securities Note if a Swap Counterparty Downgrade Event occurs in respect of the Swap 
Counterparty (or its guarantor, as applicable) and none of the remedies provided for in the Interest 
Rate Swap Agreement are put in place within the timeframe required thereunder. 
If the Interest Rate Swap Transaction is terminated because of an event of default or a termination 
event specified therein, the amount determined pursuant to Section 6 (e) of the Interest Rate Swap 
Agreement may be due to the Fund depending on market conditions at the time of termination. 
This amount (the “Swap Termination Amount”) will be determined by the method described in 
the Interest Rate Swap Agreement and could be substantial if market rates or other conditions have 
changed materially. The Swap Termination Amount may be based on the actual cost or market 
quotations provided by third parties in the market of the cost of entering into an interest rate swap 
transaction similar to the Interest Rate Swap Transaction and any unpaid amounts on or prior to the 
early termination date. 
If the Interest Rate Swap Transaction is terminated prior to redemption in full of the Floating Rate 
Notes, the Fund will be required to enter into a transaction on similar terms with a new Swap 
Counterparty. Any upfront payment to any replacement Swap Counterparty under the Interest Rate 
Swap Agreement payable by the Fund will be paid directly to the replacement Swap Counterparty 
and not in accordance with the Priority of Payments. 
Any costs, expenses, fees and taxes (including stamp taxes) arising in respect of any such transfer 
to be made by the replacement Swap Counterparty will be borne by the Swap Counterparty when 
such transfer is decided by the Swap Counterparty pursuant to paragraph 11 (h) (ii) of the CSA. 
The Management Company, in the name and on behalf of the Fund, shall use its best efforts to find 
a replacement Swap Counterparty upon early termination of the Interest Rate Swap Transaction, 
but none of the Management Company or any other party to the Transaction Documents will 
assume any liability for not finding such a replacement Swap Counterparty in accordance with the 
terms of the Transaction Documents. 
3.4.8.1.8 
Rating Downgrade Provision for the Swap Counterparty 
In the understanding that the Notes actually obtain the provisional ratings allocated by the Rating 
Agencies as described in section 7.3 of the Securities Note, the Swap Counterparty shall be obliged 
to comply with the interest rate swap required ratings envisaged in the table below (the “Interest 
Rate Swap Required Ratings”) (i.e. the “First Swap Required Ratings” and the “Second Swap 
Required Ratings”, as applicable in accordance with the table below), which at the date of 
registration of this Prospectus and according with the provisional ratings allocated by the Rating 
Agencies to the Rated Notes would be, in particular: 
Interest Rate Swap 
Required Ratings 
Moody’s 
Fitch 
First Swap Required Ratings 
A3 (or above) 
A- or F1 (or 
above) 
Second Swap Required 
Ratings 
Baa3 (or above) 
BBB- or F3 (or 
above) 
 
Failure by the Swap Counterparty to maintain the Interest Rate Swap Required Ratings would 
constitute a Swap Counterparty Downgrade Event which, if not remedied, would constitute an 


 
 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Additional Information

“Additional Termination Event” under the Interest Rate Swap Agreement with the Swap 
Counterparty being the sole “Affected Party”. 
Upon the occurrence of a Swap Counterparty Downgrade Event in relation to any Rating Agency, 
the Swap Counterparty must: 
(i) 
in case of a downgrade below the First Swap Required Ratings applicable in respect of a 
Rating Agency, post an amount of collateral as calculated by such Rating Agency in

such duties to third parties in accordance with article 30.4 of Law 5/2015, which shall not affect its

Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Additional Information 
 
 
203 
 
Receivables, in the Deed of Incorporation to perform the servicing and management of the Loans. 
The relationship between the Fund and SCF as Servicer of the Receivables will be governed by the 
provisions of the Deed of Incorporation. 
SCF will accept the mandate received from the Management Company to act as servicer of the 
Loans (the “Servicer”) and will undertake as follows: 
(i) 
to carry out the administration and management of the Receivables acquired by the Fund in 
accordance with the ordinary rules and procedures of administration and management of the 
Receivables set out in the Deed of Incorporation; 
(ii) 
to continue to administer the Loans, dedicating the same time and attention and the same 
level of expertise, care and diligence in its administration as it would dedicate and exercise 
in the administration of its own loans. In any case, it will exercise an appropriate level of 
expertise, care and diligence as regards the provision of the services stipulated in this 
Additional Information and in the Deed of Incorporation; 
(iii) 
to apply and continue to apply procedures for the administration and management of the 
Loans that are, and will continue to be, in accordance with applicable laws and legal 
provisions; 
(iv) 
to faithfully comply with the instructions given by the Management Company; 
(v) 
to carry out all actions required to maintain in full force any licenses, approvals, 
authorisations and consents that might be necessary or appropriate in relation to the 
performance of its services; 
(vi) 
to have available the equipment and personnel sufficient to carry out all its obligations; and 
(vii) 
to compensate the Fund for any damages it may suffer as a consequence of the failure to 
comply with the obligations assumed as Servicer. 
A brief description of the ordinary rules and procedures of administration and custody of the Loans 
governed by the Deed of Incorporation of the Fund is set forth in the following sections. 
3.7.1.1. 
Term and replacement of the Servicer 
The services will be provided by the Servicer from the Date of Incorporation and until all 
obligations assumed by the Servicer in relation to the Receivables assigned to the Fund are 
extinguished upon full repayment of the Loans, without prejudice to the possible early revocation 
of its mandate or its voluntary resignation. 
In the case of an Event of Replacement of the Servicer, the Management Company, with prior 
notice to the Rating Agencies, may take one of the following actions (at its discretion): 
(i) 
replace the Servicer with another entity that has at least five years of experience or is a 
prudentially regulated institution which holds the relevant regulatory authorisations or 
permissions and which, in the opinion of the Management Company, has the suitable legal 
and technical capacity to perform the services and, provided that the rating of the Rated 
Notes is not adversely affected by the replacement of the Servicer; 
(ii) 
require the Servicer to subcontract, delegate or have the performance of such obligations 
guaranteed by another entity that, in the opinion of the Management Company, has the 
suitable legal and technical capacity, provided that the rating of the Rated Notes is not 
adversely affected. 


 
 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Additional Information 
 
 
204 
 
In case an Insolvency Event occurs in respect of the Servicer, the only possible action to be 
adopted by the Management Company will be the replacement of the Servicer in accordance with 
paragraph (i) above. In accordance with Insolvency Law, the Fund, by acting through the 
Management Company, will have a right of separation in respect of the assigned Receivables, 
pursuant to articles 239 and 240 of the said Insolvency Law. This right of separation will not 
necessarily extend to the money received by the Seller, in its capacity as Servicer, and kept by the 
latter on behalf of the Fund prior to its deposit to the account of the Fund, since, given its fungible 
nature, it could be subject to the result of the insolvency proceedings according to the majority 
interpretation of article 239 of the Insolvency Law. 
Without prejudice to this obligation of SCF, the Management Company will take into account the 
proposals made by the Servicer both in connection with the subcontracting, delegation or 
appointment of the new Servicer for the fulfilment of its obligations, and in connection with the 
entity that could guarantee the fulfilment of such obligations. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the final decision as regards the appointment of the new Servicer 
and any of the aforementioned actions will correspond to the Management Company, acting in the 
name and on behalf of the Fund. 
In case an Event of Replacement of the Servicer, the Servicer makes the following undertakings to 
the Management Company: 
(i) 
To make available upon the Management Company’s request a record of the personal data 
of Borrowers necessary to issue collection orders to Borrowers or to have served on 
Borrowers the notice referred to below (the “Personal Data Record” or “PDR”). 
(ii) 
The communication and use of such data shall be limited and in any event subject to 
compliance with the Organic Law 3/2018, of 5 December, on Personal Data Protection and 
guarantee of digital rights or law replacing, amending or implementing the same, and the 
Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 
on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on 
the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC. 
(iii) 
Upon the Management Company request, to deposit the PDR before a public notary in 
order that it may be searched or used in due course by the Management Company in case of 
need in connection with the Loan servicing functions. 
(iv) 
To assist the Management Company using all reasonable efforts in the substitution process 
and, as the case may be, notify the Borrowers and the Insurance Companies. 
(v) 
As soon as reasonably practicable, deliver and make available to the Management Company 
(or any person appointed by it) the files delivered to it by the Seller (if different from the 
Servicer), copies of all records (including, without limitation, computer records and books 
of records), correspondence, and documents in its possession or under its control relating to 
the relevant Receivables assigned to the Fund and any sums and other assets, if any, then 
held by the Servicer on behalf of the Management Company, and the hand-over of claims 
(whether judicial or not). 
(vi) 
To do such things and execute such contracts as shall require the Servicer’s involvement in 
order for functions to be effectively transferred to the new Servicer. 
The Servicer may, in turn, voluntarily resign its position as servicer and therefore decide not to 
administer and manage the Receivables if permitted by laws in force from time to time. The 
voluntary resignation of the Servicer is subject to (i) prior authorization of the Management 


 
 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Additional Information 
 
 
205 
 
Company, (ii) the Management Company has appointed a new Servicer which has effectively 
accepted to start carrying out its duties, (iii) the Servicer has indemnified the Fund for any 
damages caused to the Fund by the resignation and replacement (including any additional cost, will 
not be charged to the Fund), and (iv) the rating of the Notes is not adversely affected. 
The assignment of the Receivables to the Fund will not be notified to the Borrowers except if 
required by law. 
However, upon the occurrence of an Insolvency Event of the Servicer or in case of indications 
thereof, or liquidation or replacement of the Servicer, or if the Management Company considers it 
to be reasonably justified, the Management Company may request the Servicer to notify the 
Borrowers and the Insurance Companies of the assignment of the outstanding Receivables to the 
Fund and that the payments derived therefrom will only release the debt if payment is made into 
the Treasury Account opened in the name of the Fund. However, if the Servicer has not served the 
notice to the Borrowers within five (5) Business Days of receipt of the request by the Management 
Company, or in the case that the Servicer is in insolvency proceedings, the Management Company 
itself, either directly or through a new designated servicer or agent, may notify the Borrowers and 
the Insurance Companies. 
3.7.1.2. 
Custody of agreement, deeds, documents and files 
The Servicer will keep all the Loan Agreements, copies of instruments, documents and computer 
files related to the Loans in safe custody and will not abandon the possession, custody or control 
thereof without the prior written consent of the Management Company, unless the document is 
necessary to commence proceedings for the enforcement of a Loan or any security thereof. 
The Servicer will at all times reasonably provide the Management Company or the duly authorised 
auditor of the Fund with access to such Loan Agreements, instruments, documents and records. If 
the Management Company so requests, the Servicer will also provide a free-of-charge copy or 
photocopy of any of such Loan Agreements, instruments and documents within five (5) Business 
Days following such request. The Servicer must act in the same way in the case of requests for 
information from the auditor of the Fund. 
In any case, the Servicer waives the privileges which the law confers thereon in its condition as 
manager of collections for the Fund and of the custody of the Loan Agreements, and particularly 
those established in articles 1,730 and 1,780 of the Civil Code (regarding the retention of pledged 
items) and 276 of the Spanish Commercial Code (security similar to the retention of pledged 
items). 
3.7.1.3. 
Collection management 
SCF, as Servicer, will receive on account of the Fund any amounts paid by the Borrowers under 
the Receivables, both for principal or interest, as well as any other concept, and will proceed to 
deposit into the Treasury Account, any such amounts immediately and in any case within two (2) 
Business Days following the receipt of the funds. 
3.7.1.4. 
Advance of funds 
In no event will the Servicer be obliged to advance any amount that has not been previously 
received from the Borrowers as principal, interest or financial charge, prepayment or other item 
under the Loans. 


 
 
 
Santander Consumer Spain Auto 2022-1, F.T. – Additional Information 
 
 
206 
 
3.7.1.5. 
Information 
The Servicer must periodically inform the Management Company and the Rating Agencies of the 
Borrowers’ level of compliance with their obligations deriving from the Loans, of the compliance 
by the Servicer with its obligation to deposit the amounts received from the Loans, of the actions 
taken in the event of delay, and of the existence of hidden defects in, or the breach of any 
Eligibility Criteria by, the Receivables. 
The Servicer must prepare and deliver to the Management Company the additional information 
that the Management Company may reasonably request regarding the Loans, the Receivables or 
any rights arising therefrom. 
In particular, the Servicer shall provide in a timely manner to the Originator, as Reporting Entity, 
any reports, data and other information in the correct format to fulfil the reporting requirements of 
article 7 of the EU Securitisation Regulation (including, inter alia, the information, if available, 
related to the environmental performance of the Vehicles). 
3.7.1.6. 
Subrogation of the Borrower under the Loans 
The Servicer will be authorised to permit subrogations in the position of the Borrower in the Loan 
Agreements only in those cases in which the new Borrower complies with SCF Policies that may 
be in force at any given time, and provided that (i) it conforms to the Loan origination standards 
described in section 2.2.7 of this Additional Information, and (ii) the expenses deriving from such 
subrogation are paid in full by the new Borrower (unless otherwise provided by law).  
The Management Company may totally or partially limit this authority of the Servicer, or subject 
the power to conditions, if such subrogations may negatively affect the ratings of the Rated Notes 
given by the Rating Agencies. 
The Management Company must in any case be immediately notified by the Servicer of any 
subrogation in accordance with the preceding paragraph. The subrogation of the Loan must not 
adversely or otherwise negatively affect the Receivables portfolio. 
3.7.1.7. 
Powers and actions in relation to Loan forbearance processes 
The Management Company generally authorises the Servicer to carry out the refinancing or 
restructuring of the Loans provided for in the Bank of Spain’s Circular 04/2017 of 27 November, 
amending Circular 4/2016 of 27 April and 4/2004 of 22 December, to credit institutions, on public 
financial reporting standards and reserved and models of financial statements, and in any 
guidelines that the EBA may issue in order to better define forbearance measures (hereinafter, 
“Refinancing or Restructuring”) and in the terms and conditions described below and always 
provided that such actions do not reduce the rank, legal effectiveness or economic value of the 
guarantees. The Servicer shall have appropriate procedures in place to ensure that the value of the 
guarantees is not prejudiced as a result of a Refinancing or Restructuring. Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, the Servicer will deal with the requests made by the Borrowers with the same diligence 
and procedure as if dealing with other loans held in its balance sheet or otherwise administered by 
the Servicer. 
A Refinancing or Restructuring of a Loan will be required to be formalised under a deed granted 
before a public notary only in the following events:

with an outstanding risk equal to or higher than € 18,000. 
(iii) 
Refinancing or Restructuring processes of groups of products with a total outstanding risk

The Management Company authorises SCF to effect Refinancings or Restructurings of Loans

lower than 3.95%. 
(ii) 
That the weighted average rate of the Loans pooled in the Fund after the Refinancing or 
Restructuring is not lower than 6.0%. 
(iii) 
The term of maturity for a specific Loan may be extended (including, without limitation, 
through the granting of payment holidays) provided that the new final maturity date or last 
repayment date of the Loan will be, at the latest, on the Final Maturity Date. 
(iv) 
The interest rate and/or the term of maturity of a specific Loan may be restructured only if 
the relevant requirements are met and within the specified limits. 
(v) 
The aggregate Outstanding Balance of the Receivables under the Loans assigned to the 
Fund in respect of which a Refinancing or Restructuring is effected may not exceed 10% of 
the Outstanding Balance of the Receivables as at the Date of Incorporation. 
In any event, after any Refinancing or Restructuring takes place in accordance with the provisions 
of this section, the Servicer will immediately inform the Management Company of the terms and 
conditions resulting from each such Refinancing or Restructuring. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, and if the Borrower is a legal person, pursuant to article 623 of the 
Insolvency Law, the court may order the judicial endorsement of any Refinancing or Restructuring 
which may have the following effects on a Loan in accordance with the majorities of the financial 
liabilities that have approved the Refinancing or Restructuring: (i) extension, whether of the 
principal, interest or any other amount owed for a period of five years or more, but in no case 
exceeding ten; (ii) debt relief; (iii) conversion of the debt into shares or interests in the debtor 
company; (iv) conversion of the debt into equity loans for a term of five years or more, but in no 
case exceeding ten; or (v) the assignment of the creditors’ property or rights in lieu of payment of 
all or part of the debt. 
The limits set forth above shall not apply to (and thus, any of the following are expressly allowed 
in any event): 
(i) 
The granting of any Moratoriums; and 
(ii) 
those qualifying as renegotiations in accordance with Circular 04/2017 of 27 November, 
amending Circular 4/2016 of 27 April and Circular 4/2004 of 22 December, to credit 
institutions, on public financial reporting standards and reserved and models of financial 
statements, and with regards to any guidelines that the EBA may issue in order to better 
define forbearance measures (such renegotiations are not considered as Refinancings or

In addition to this, in accordance with the representation given by the Seller under section 
2.2.8(51) of the Additional Information, no Receivables assigned to the Fund shall be affected by 
Covid-19 Moratoriums at the time of their assignment to the Fund. Moreover, the Seller will 
neither replace nor repurchase Receivables affected by Covid-19 Moratoriums or any other similar 
measures (including any other Moratoriums of any type) after their assignment to the Fund. 
For the purposes of this section: 
“Covid-19 Moratoriums” means, jointly, Covid-19 Legal Moratoriums and Covid-19 Contractual 
Moratoriums. 
“Covid-19 Legal Moratoriums” means the moratoriums foreseen in Royal Decree-Law 11/2020 
(as amended by, among others, Royal Decree-Law 26/2020), together with any settlement, 
suspension of payments, rescheduling of the amortisation plan or other contractual amendments 
resulting from or arising from mandatory provisions of law or regulation granted in connection 
with measures in force to tackle the effects of the Covid-19. 
“Covid-19 Contractual Moratoriums” means any voluntary moratoriums or deferment of

institutional or industry associations, including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Covid-19 
Moratoriums that may be applicable to the Receivables at any time after the relevant Assignment 
Date). 
3.7.1.8. 
Set-off 
Notwithstanding the representation made in section 2.2.8 (ii) (32) of this Additional Information, 
in the event that any of the Borrowers has a liquid, due and payable credit right against the 
Servicer, resulting in one or more of the Loans being totally or partially set-off against such right, 
the Servicer will remedy this circumstance such that the set-off does not apply, or if this is not 
possible, it will deposit in the Treasury Account of the Fund the amount which was set-off plus 
interest due from the date of set-off until the date on which the deposit is made, calculated in 
accordance with the terms and conditions applicable to the corresponding Loan. 
3.7.1.9. 
Subcontracting 
The Servicer may subcontract any of the services which it has undertaken to provide by virtue of 
the above provisions and those of the Deed of Incorporation, except for those services that cannot 
be delegated pursuant to applicable law. In no case will such subcontracting entail any additional 
cost or expense for the Fund or the Management Company, and it must not cause a downgrade of 
the rating of the Rated Notes by the Rating Agencies. Notwithstanding any subcontracting or 
delegation, (i) the Management Company shall not be excused or released under the subcontract or 
subdelegation from any of the liabilities assumed under article 26.1.b) of Law 5/2015, and (ii) the 
Servicer will not be discharged or released through such subcontracting or delegation from any of 
the liabilities assumed and that are legally attributable to or enforceable against the Servicer.

3.7.1.10. 
Liability of the Servicer and indemnity 
The Servicer undertakes to act with due diligence as regards to the collection management for the 
Loans as well as the custody and administration of the Loans and will be liable to the Fund, 
through its Management Company, for any damage that arise from its negligence. 
The Servicer will indemnify the Fund, through its Management Company, for any damage, loss or 
expense it may incur due to the failure to comply with its obligations concerning collection 
management and/or custody and/or administration of the Loans. 
The Servicer does not assume liability in any form as regards directly or indirectly guaranteeing 
the success of the transaction, nor will it provide security or enter into agreements for the 
repurchase of the Receivables other than in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in 
section 2.2.9 of this Additional Information. 
Neither the Noteholders nor any other credit of the Fund shall have any direct right of action 
whatsoever against the Servicer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, under article 26.1.b) and 26.2 of 
Law 5/2015, the Management Company shall be liable to the Noteholders and other creditors of 
the Fund for all and any losses caused them by a breach of its obligation to service and manage the 
Receivables pooled in the Fund. 
3.7.1.11. 
Notices 
The Management Company and the Seller have agreed to not notify the assignment of the 
Receivables to the relevant Borrowers except when required by law. As of the Date of 
Incorporation, notice is required by law to Borrowers in (i) the Autonomous Community of 
Valencia, pursuant to Decree-Law 1/2019, of December 13, of the Consell, approving the 
consolidated version of the Statute of consumers and users of the Valencian Community; and to 
the extent required, (ii) Comunidad Foral de Navarra, pursuant to Law 21/2019, of 4 April. There 
is as well a requirement foreseen in Castilla-La Mancha, pursuant to Law 3/2019, of 22 March, 
however this requirement is still under regulatory development. For these purposes, notice to the 
Borrowers is not a requirement for the validity of the assignment of the Receivables under the 
Loans. It is worth noting that the Spanish Constitutional Court has recently declared in its Ruling 
72/2021, of 18 March 2021, that article 29 of Law 6/2019, of 20 February relating to consumer 
protection in the Extremadura region (which required notice of the transfer of mortgage loans to 
securitisation funds to be served on the relevant mortgage borrowers) is contrary to the Spanish 
Constitution and hence null and void on grounds that it affects the contractual relationship between 
the relevant parties in a manner which only state-level (rather than regional-level) legislation can 
affect. 
However, upon the occurrence of an Insolvency Event of the Servicer or in case of indications 
thereof, or liquidation or the replacement of the Servicer, or if the Management Company 
considers it to be reasonably justified, the Management Company may request the Servicer to 
notify the Borrowers and the Insurance Companies of the assignment of the outstanding 
Receivables to the Fund and that the payments derived therefrom will only release the debt if 
payment is made into the Treasury Account opened in the name of the Fund. However, if the 
Servicer has not served the notice to the Borrowers within five (5) Business Days of receipt of the 
request by the Management Company, or in the case that the Servicer is in insolvency proceedings, 
the Management Company itself, either directly or through a new designated servicer or agent, 
may notify the Borrowers and the Insurance Companies.

Accordingly, the Seller will grant to the Management Company the broadest powers as are 
necessary under law so that it may, in the name of the Fund, notify the Borrowers of the 
assignment at the time it deems appropriate. 
The Seller will assume the expenses incurred in notifying the Borrowers, even if notification is 
provided by the Management Company. 
3.7.1.12. 
Servicer’s remuneration 
As consideration for being in charge of the custody, servicing and management of the Loans, the 
Servicer shall have the right to receive in arrears on each Payment Date a servicing fee (the 
“Servicer’s Fee”), including VAT, if there is no exemption available, equal to 0.125% per annum 
which will accrue for the actual days in each Interest Accrual Period, and will be calculated on the 
basis of the sum of the Outstanding Balance of the Floating Rate Notes on the Determination Date 
corresponding to that Payment Date. Any extraordinary expenses that the Servicer might incur are 
included in the Servicer’s Fee. 
If the Fund, through its Management Company, does not pay the entire Servicer’s Fee on a 
Payment Date due to the lack of sufficient liquidity in accordance with the Pre-Enforcement 
Priority of Payments, any unpaid amounts shall be added –without any kind of penalty– to the fee 
to be paid on the following Payment Date. 
3.7.2. 
Management Company 
3.7.2.1. 
Management, administration and representation of the Fund and of the Noteholders

The Management Company must perform its activities with the utmost diligence required thereof

involving conflicts of interest, and giving priority to the interests of the Noteholders and the Other 
Creditors of the Fund over its own. 
Each of the Noteholders by purchasing or subscribing for the Notes agrees with the Fund that:

sums payable to each Noteholder in respect of the Fund's obligations to such Noteholder 
shall be limited to the lesser of (a) the aggregate amount of all sums due and payable to 
such Noteholder and (b) the aggregate amounts of the Available Funds, net of any sums 
which are payable to other persons in priority to or pari passu with such Noteholder in

the Deed of Incorporation and the applicable laws and regulations; and 
(v) 
no meeting of creditors (junta de acreedores) will be established. 
Various potential and actual conflicts of interest may arise between the interests of the 
Noteholders, on the one hand, and the interests of any of the Transaction Parties, on the other hand, 
as a result of the various businesses and activities of the Transaction Parties, and none of such 
persons is required to resolve such conflicts of interest in favour of the Noteholders except for the 
obligations legally vested on the Management Company, who, pursuant to article 26.1.f) of Law 
5/2015 must have in place procedural and organisational measures to prevent potential conflicts of 
interests. 
The Management Company will be liable to the Noteholders and other creditors of the Fund for all 
damages caused thereto by a breach of its obligations. It will be liable for the penalties applicable 
thereto pursuant to the provisions of Law 5/2015. 
The Management Company has the necessary resources, including suitable technology information 
systems, to discharge its duties of administering the Fund as attributed thereto by Law 5/2015. 
In accordance with article 29.1.j) of the Law 5/2015, the Management Company has adhered to the

of the information described above for the purposes of complying with article 5 of the EU
