I. RISK FACTORS 
1. 
RISKS DERIVING FROM THE LEGAL STATUS AND BUSINESS OF THE ISSUER 
1.1. 
Nature of the fund and obligations of the Sociedad Gestora 
The Fund will be established as a separate capital base without legal form that, in accordance with 
Royal Decree 926/1998, May 14th, regulating asset securitisation funds and management companies 
of asset securitisation funds (hereinafter referred to as “Royal Decree 926/1998”), is managed by a 
securitisation funds’ managing company (“Sociedad Gestora”). The Fund will only meet its financial 
liabilities to its creditors with its capital. 
The Sociedad Gestora will carry out for the Fund those functions laid out under Royal Decree 
926/1998, as well as protecting bondholders interests as manager of third party funds, without the 
existence of a bondholders syndicate. The capacity to defend the bondholders’ interests will thus 
depend on the resources of the Sociedad Gestora. 
1.2. 
Forced replacement of the Sociedad Gestora 
In accordance with article 19 of Royal Decree 926/1998, in the event of the Sociedad Gestora being 
declared bankrupt, and without prejudice to the effects of that situation of bankruptcy described 
below, a sociedad gestora will be found to replace it.  Provided that in this last case, four months have 
elapsed since the event determining the substitution took place and no new sociedad gestora has 
been found to take charge of managing the Fund,  early liquidation of the Fund will take place and the 
securities issued and charged to it shall be redeemed, pursuant to the provisions of the Deed of 
Incorporation of the Fund and in this Prospectus 
1.3. 
Insolvency of the Sociedad Gestora, of the assignor and other entities  
Bankruptcy of any of the intervening companies  (either Ibercaja, the Sociedad Gestora or any other 
entity which is a counterparty to the Fund) may affect its contractual relations with the Fund in 
accordance with the provisions of Law 22/2003, of July 9, Bankruptcy Law (hereinafter, “Bankruptcy 
Law”). 
In accordance with Royal Decree 926/1998, if the Sociedad Gestora is declared insolvent, it must find 
another sociedad gestora to replace it. 
Without prejudice to the foregoing, in the event of insolvency of the Sociedad Gestora, the assets  
belonging to the Fund in possession of the Sociedad Gestora over which the latter has no right of use, 
guarantee or retention (except for monies due to their fungible nature) existing in the asset base, will 
be considered as belonging to the Fund and will be handed over by the receivers to the Fund at the 
request of the Fund. The structure of the bond securitisation transaction contemplated does not allow 
for any sums in cash to exist that could be incorporated into the Sociedad Gestora’s asset base, 
except in the event of breach of contract by the parties, since the amounts pertaining to the Fund 
must be deposited in the accounts opened in the name of the Fund (Reinvestment Account, Treasury 
Account with the possibility also of an Excess Account)  by the Sociedad Gestora, (which intervenes 
in opening these accounts, not as an agent of the Fund, but as its legal representative, for which 
reason  the Fund will be able to exercise the right of absolute separation, as provided for in articles 80 
and 81 of the Bankruptcy Law).  
In the event of Ibercaja being declared insolvent, the issue and assignment of the Mortgage Shares 
and Mortgage Transfer Certificates may only be withdrawn in the case of exercising the action of 
withdrawal, demonstrating the existence of fraud in that issue and assignment, in accordance with 
the provisions of Additional Provision Five, in paragraph 4 of Act 3/1994 of April 14. 


The "Folleto Informativo" drafted in the Spanish language is the only official document, and no document other than the "Folleto Informativo" shall 
have any legal effect or be relied upon with regard to the Bond Issue.This prospectus is a translation into English of the original "Folleto Informativo" 
drafted in Spanish language and registered with the "Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores" (the Spanish Securities Market Commission, 
"CNMV") on October 11, 2005 
 
2 
Furthermore, in the event that Ibercaja is declared insolvent pursuant to Bankruptcy Law, the Fund, 
acting through the Sociedad Gestora, will have the right of separation over the Multiple Securities 
under the terms provided for in articles 80 and 81 of the Bankruptcy Law. In addition, the Fund, acting 
through its Sociedad Gestora, will have the right to obtain  from Ibercaja the amounts resulting from 
the Shares and Certificates, since these amounts will be considered as belonging to the Fund, 
through its  Sociedad Gestora, and consequently, they will be transferred to the Sociedad Gestora on 
behalf of the Fund. Notwithstanding the above, it should not be ruled out that that it might not be 
possible to exercise that right of separation in respect of the funds managed by Ibercaja, for the 
account and at the order of the Fund, during the course of its fund-collecting duties with respect to the

and social factors such as the age of the debtors, seasonal factors, market interest rates and the 
unemployment rate, which make them impossible to predict . 
2.4. 
Delinquency interest 
The existence of delays in the payment of interest or principal to the Bondholders shall in no case 
result in additional interest in their favour.

RISKS DERIVED FROM THE ASSETS BACKING THE ISSUE 
3.1. 
Risk of default on the mortgage loans 
 
Holders of the Bonds issued by the Fund will be exposed to the risk of default on the Mortgage Loans 
and Mortgage Transfer Certificates pooled in the fund, always taking into account the protection 
provided by credit enhancements referred to in the Additional Module. 
The Assignor will not assume any liability whatsoever for the non-payment by the Mortgage Debtors 
of principal, interest or any other amount that may be due by virtue of the Mortgage Loans. The 
Assignor, in accordance with article 348 of the Commercial Code, is liable to the Fund only for the 
existence and legitimacy of the Mortgage Loans and the personality with which it performs  the sale. 
The Assignor will not, under any circumstances, assume any responsibility in guaranteeing, either 
directly or indirectly, the success of the operation, nor will it give guarantees or warranties, nor enter 
into agreements for repurchasing Mortgage Shares Certificates and Mortgage Transfer Certificates, 
neither by virtue of the Fund Regulations nor by virtue of any other pact or contract. All of the above is 
without prejudice to the responsibilities of the Assignor (i) in respect of the management commitment 
in respect of the Mortgage Loans, described in section 3.7.1 of the Additional Module and the Deed of 
Incorporation, (ii) in respect of the replacement obligation set forth in section 2.2.9. of the Additional 
Module, and (iii)and (ii) in relation to the representations and warranties of the Assignor of the Fund 
with respect to the Mortgage Loans contained in section 2.2.8. of the Additional Module.

Sociedad Gestora. No other guarantees have been granted by any public or private entities, including 
IBERCAJA, the Sociedad Gestora, or any other firm affiliated with or invested in by any of the above. 
3.2. 
Limited protection 
An investment in the Bonds may be affected, among other things, by a downturn in general economic 
conditions which may adversely affect the payments of the Mortgage Loans which support the Fund. 
Sufficiently high defaults could reduce, or even eliminate, the protection of the A, B, C, and D Bonds 
against losses in the Mortgage Loan portfolio, which is provided through the credit enhancements 
described in the Additional Module. 
3.3. 
Risk of prepayment of the mortgage loans 
The Mortgage Share Certificates and Mortgage Transfer Certificates grouped in the Fund are subject 
to prepayment when the Debtors of the Mortgage Loans reimburse the amount of the outstanding 
principal of said Mortgage Loans, or in the event of their being subrogated in the corresponding 
Mortgage Loans by another bank qualified for that purpose, subject to Law 2/1994 of March 30 on the 
subrogation and modification of mortgage loans, in its valid text ( “Law 2/1994”) or  by virtue of any 
other cause that could produce the same. 
The risk entailed by said prepayment will be transferred quarterly, on each Payment Date, to the 
Bondholders in accordance with the redemption rules described in section 4.9 of the Securities 
Document.

a) 
Shares and Certificates subscribed by the Fund:  
The Shares and Certificates are registered in the Funds assets for an amount equal to their face 
value, coinciding with their acquisition value. Interest on the Shares and Certificates are recorded in

Shares and Certificates not declared to be in Default are recorded as an asset in the balance sheet.

Default are recorded as assets, except in those cases where it can be demonstrated that the 
mortgaged property is insufficient as a guarantee.

Bonds issued:

reimbursement value. Interest payable by virtue of the Bonds is recorded in the profit and loss 
account on an accrued basis, and that portion of such interest that is accrued, in accordance with  the  
principle of accrual  which is owed but remains unpaid is recorded in the related liabilities account.

pre-established reinvestment mechanisms. The amount of the accounts will be entered as a Fund

assets and liabilities being different. The profits obtained on this agreement are recorded in the profit 
and loss account symmetrically to the profits obtained by the elements covered.

Investment income of Securitisation Funds is subject to the general rules on withholdings on 
account of Corporate Income Tax, with the particularity that article 59-k of the Regulations 
approved by Royal Decree 1777/2004 of 30 July 2004 (hereinafter, “Royal Decree 
1777/2004”), provides that withholding does not apply to “income from mortgage participating 
units, mortgage loans and other credit rights that constitute revenue items for the 
securitisation funds”. Consequently, in addition to income from Mortgage Transfer Certificates 
which are the direct object of the securitisation, the withholding exemption also extends, 
according to the expressly stated policy of the tax authorities, to income from Mortgage Loans, 
insofar as they form part of the ordinary business activity of the said funds. 
3) 
Article 5.10 of Act 19/1992 provides that the formation of mortgage securitisation funds is 
exempt from classification as “corporate operations” for Capital Transfer Tax and Stamp Duty 
purposes, thereby predetermining its submission to same. 
Article 16 of Royal Decree Law 3/1993, which approved urgent measures on budgetary, tax, 
financial and employment matters, authorised the national government to “extend the regime 
provided for securitisation of mortgage participating units (…) to the securitisation of other 
Mortgage Loans and credit rights”.  This authority was ratified and expanded by the Fifth 
Additional Provision of Act 3/1994. 
Similarly, Royal Decree 926/1998 provides that asset securitisation funds, insofar as that 
regulation is silent, will be subject to the rules contained in Act 19/1992 for mortgage 
securitisation funds, to the extent they are applicable having regard to their specific nature. 


The "Folleto Informativo" drafted in the Spanish language is the only official document, and no document other than the "Folleto Informativo" shall 
have any legal effect or be relied upon with regard to the Bond Issue.This prospectus is a translation into English of the original "Folleto Informativo" 
drafted in Spanish language and registered with the "Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores" (the Spanish Securities Market Commission, 
"CNMV") on October 11, 2005 
 
11 
Therefore, even when Royal Decree 926/1998 does not specifically refer to the tax treatment 
applicable to Asset Securitisation Funds, it may be understood that the exemption of the 
“Corporate Operations” item mentioned previously is also applicable to the incorporation of 
Asset Securitisation Funds (such as this Fund). 
4) 
The transfer to the Fund of the Shares and Certificates envisaged in the Deed in the manner 
described above is a transaction subject to, but also exempt from, Value Added Tax, in 
accordance with the provisions contained in Article 20.One.18-e of Value Added Tax Law 
37/1992 of 28 December 1992 (hereinafter referred to as the “VAT Law”. 
The establishment and assignment of guarantees is subject to the general tax regime with no 
exceptions. 
5) 
As regards Value Added Tax, the Fund will be subject to general VAT regulations, the sole 
exception being that the management and depository services rendered on behalf of the Fund 
by the Sociedad Gestora will be exempt from Value Added Tax, as provided in Article 5.10 of 
Law 19/1992 and Article 20.One.18- n) of the VAT Law. 
6) 
The Bonds issue will be exempt from Value Added Tax (Article 20.One.18 of the VAT Law) 
and from Capital Transfer Tax and Stamp Duty (Impuesto sobre Transmisiones Patrimoniales 
y Actos Jurídicos Documentados) (Article 45-I.B number 15 of the Consolidated Text of the 
Capital Transfer Tax and Stamp Duty Act, confirmed by the ruling handed down by the 
Spanish Supreme Court on 3 November 1997).

underwriting commitments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Underwriters and Placement Entities 
shall be entitled to deduct such fee from any amounts to be delivered to the Fund in accordance with

Bond interest 
Variable annual nominal interest, calculated and payable on a quarterly basis, will accrue as from [●] 
October 2005, i.e. three (3) Working Days after the Incorporation Date, the date of payment of the 
Bonds and of price of Shares and Certificates to the Assignor (hereinafter referred to as the 
“Disbursement Date”), until they are fully redeemed.  
This annual nominal interest will be paid at the end of each quarter on each Payment Date on the

referred to as the “Nominal Balance Pending Collection”) for each Bond at the beginning of this 
Interest Accrual Period, as long as the Fund has sufficient funds in accordance with the Priority Order 
of Payments. 
For accrual purposes, the Bond interest period will be divided into interest accrual periods 
(hereinafter referred to as “Interest Accrual Periods”), which will be the period between 
two consecutive Payment Dates (including the first payment date and excluding the last 
payment date). The first Accrual Period will begin on the Disbursement Date and will end 
on the first Payment Date, namely 26 January 2006 (excluding this date). 
The Nominal Interest Rate, as defined in the following section, will accrue over the days 
actually elapsed of each Interest Accrual Period for which this rate has been determined 
and will be calculated on the basis of a year of three hundred and sixty (360) days. 
The annual rate of interest accrued on Bonds during each Interest Accrual Period will be 
the sum of the following two factors: 
(i) 
the Reference Interest Rate, as defined below, and rounded to the nearest 
thousandth of a percentage point, taking into account that, if the amount rounded 
up or down is identical, such rounding will be performed upwards; and 
(ii)  
the margin applicable to the Bonds, as indicated below. 
Reference Interest Rate 
The Reference Interest Rate for determining the interest rate applicable to the Bonds will 
be the 3-month EURIBOR, or an alternative interest rate, if required, which will be 
determined as follows (hereinafter referred to as the “Reference Interest Rate”). 
EURIBOR is the market’s reference interest rate for the Euro.

“”Determination of the Reference Interest Rate 
On each Determination Date (as defined in the present section), the Sociedad Gestora will 
determine the Reference Interest Rate, which will be equal to the EURIBOR, as follows:  
(i) 
The three-month EURIBOR which appears on the REUTERS’ screen, EURIBOR= page at 11:00 
am, Madrid time, on the Determination Date, on a 360 day basis. “REUTERS’ screen, EURIBOR= page” 
is the page that displays the content of the “EURIBOR=” page on the REUTERS MONITOR MONEY 
RATES SERVICE (or any other page that might replace in this service). 
(ii) 
In absence of the rates indicated in part (i) above, the average shall be that corresponding to the 
three-month EURIBOR rate on the Determination Date which appears on the “TELERATE” screen 
(TELERATE SPAIN, S.A.), page 248, (or any other page that might replace it in this service) at 11:00, 
Madrid time. 
(iii) 
In absence of the rates indicated in parts (i) and (ii) above, the average shall be that corresponding 
to the London three-month interbank interest rates for Euro-denominated deposit operations declared 
simultaneously on the Determination Date by the following institutions (the rate will be requested 
simultaneously to these entities): 
• 
Banco Santander Central Hispano (London office) 
• 
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (London) 
• 
Barclays Bank (London) 
• 
Confederación Española de Cajas de Ahorros (London office) 
If any of these institutions do not supply quotes, the applicable rate shall be the 
simple arithmetic mean of the quoted interest rates declared by at least two of the 
remaining institutions.  
(iv) 
If the rates cannot be determined by the procedures mentioned in (i), (ii), and (iii) above, the 
applicable rate shall be the Reference Interest Rate applicable for the previous Interest Accrual Period. 
On the First Determination Date, if no Reference Rate has been published as stipulated in sections (i), 
(ii) and (iii) above, the rate published on the last Business Day on which this Reference Interest Rate 
has been published will be used, in accordance with section (i). 
The Sociedad Gestora will keep lists of the content of REUTERS or TELERATE pages, or, 
where appropriate, the quotes supplied by the institutions mentioned in subsection (iii) 
above, as evidence of the type of EURIBOR established. 
Once the Reference Interest Rate for the Bonds has been determined, and on the same 
Determination Date, the Sociedad Gestora will calculate and determine for each Series of 
Bond the applicable interest rate for the following Interest Accrual Period. 
Determination Date of the Referente Interest Rate and Interest Rate of the Bonds  
The date of determination of the Reference Interest Date for each Interest Accrual Period shall be on 
the second (2nd) Business Day prior to a Payment Date (or the Disbursement Date for the first Interest 
Accrual Period) and shall apply to the following Interest Accrual Period (hereinafter, “Determination

to Underwriters and Placement Entities, so that they may communicate them in their turn 
to investors interested in subscribing the Bonds. At the same time, the Sociedad Gestora 
will also notify the CNMV of this as additional information to the Prospectus. The final 
spreads applicable will be certified in the closing deed. In any case, the spreads of all the 
series of Bonds will be set before the beginning of the Subscription Period.

Ii is the total amount of interest accrued on the Bonds in the series during the Interest 
Accrual Period. 
ri is the Nominal Interest Rate of the Bonds in the series on an annual basis, calculated as 
the sum of the Reference Interest Rate for the relevant Interest Accrual Period plus the 
margin established for each series.  
ni is the number of days in the Interest Accrual Period. 
4.8.1 Dates, place, entities and procedure for interest payments 
Interest payments on the Bonds and repayment of the principal, regardless of the series, will be made 
quarterly on 26 January, April, July and October of every year until the Bonds are fully redeemed 
(each date will hereinafter be referred to as a “Payment Date”). If one of these dates is not a 
Business Day, the interest for the quarter will be paid on the next Business Day immediately after the 
aforementioned date. 
For the purposes of this Prospectus, business days (“Business Days”) are all days except the 
following: 
• 
holidays in the city of Madrid, or 
• 
non-business days on the TARGET (Trans European Automated Real-Time Gross Settlement 
Express Transfer System) calendar. 
If on a Payment Date, and despite the mechanisms established to protect the rights of the 
Bondholders, the Available Resources of the Fund, as defined below in section 3.4.6.2. of the 
Additional Module, are not sufficient to satisfy all of the payment obligations of the Fund, the amount 
available will be distributed in accordance with the Priority Order of Payments.  
Established withholdings, contributions and other taxes, as well as any taxes that may be established 
in the future on the principal, interest, or yields of the Bonds, will be solely borne by the Bondholders 
and the corresponding amounts will be deducted, accordingly, by the designated entity in the form 
established by law. 
The payment procedure will comply with the rules contained in section 4.7 of this Securities 
Document. 
4.8.2 Description of the underlying asset on which the interest rate is based; historic 
information  
The Reference Interest Rate to be used to determine the nominal interest rate applicable to each 
Bond Series is that described in section 4.8 of the Securities Document. 
At present, the Euribor rate is the rate of Interbank deposits offered in Euro calculated as the daily 
average of the rates provided for fifteen maturity terms by a panel composed by 57 banks which are 
the most active in the Euro zone. The rate is quoted on the basis of true days to maturity and years 
composed of 360 days, and is fixed at 11:00 (CET) expressed with three decimal points. 
Definitions relating to the Euribor rate approved by the European Banking Federation (FBE) and by 
the ACI (Asociacion Cambista Internacional) complementary to the actual definition of the Euribor 
rate are deemed included to the effects the Reference Interest Rate relative to the Euribor rate not

4.9.2 Redemption date 
The Bond redemption dates will be the Payment Dates, i.e. 26 January, 26 April, 26 July and 26 
October of every year. The first Payment Date will be 26 January 2006. 
4.9.3 Ordinary rules governing the redemption of series A and D bonds  
The redemption of Series A Bonds will begin on the first Payment Date. 
The redemption of Series B Bonds will only begin once all the Series A Bonds are fully redeemed, 
except in the case described in section 4.9.4. of this Securities Document. 
The redemption of Series C Bonds will only begin once all the Series A and B Bonds are fully 
redeemed, except in the case described in section 4.9.4. of this Securities Document. 
The redemption of Series D Bonds will only begin once all the Series A, B and C Bonds are fully 
redeemed, except in the case described in section 4.9.4. of this Securities Document. 
Series A, B, C and D Bonds will be redeemed on a pro rata basis among the Bonds from the same 
redeemable Series (as provided below), by reducing the nominal amount, until it has been fully 
redeemed, on each Payment Date. 
The Bonds will be redeemed on each Payment Date from Available Resources in an amount equal to 
the lesser of the following amounts: 
a) 
the positive difference on that Payment Date between the Outstanding Nominal Balance to 
Payment of the Bonds (prior to the redemption to be performed on that Payment Date) and the 
Outstanding Nominal Balance of the Shares and Certificates which do not have to be treated 
as Defaulted Shares and Certificates, in accordance with the definition below (hereinafter, the 
“Non-Defaulted Shares and Certificates”)) corresponding to the last day of the month prior 
to the Payment Date; and 
b) 
The Available Resources on that Payment Date, less the amounts corresponding to previous 
items on the Priority Order of Payments described in section 3.4.6.3. of the Additional Module.  
Consequently, Shares and Certificates (for which the corresponding Mortgage Loans have a 
payment delay of at least 18 months or more or which have been declared as defaulted by the 
Assignor (hereinafter referred to as the “Defaulted Shares or Certificates”), will result in the 
redemption of the Bonds. The Available Resources of the Fund will be used for redemption purposes, 
following the payment of the prior commitments in the Priority Order of Payments described in section 
3.4.6.3. of the Additional Module. If there are no Available Resources to cover these payments, the 
corresponding amounts will remain outstanding until the next Payment Date. 
If the Shares and Certificates cannot be replaced, as established in section 2.2.9. of the Additional 
Module, the amounts originating from early redemption, by the Assignor, of the Shares and/or 
Certificates in question will be used to redeem the Bonds on the next Payment Date, subject to the 
Priority Payment Order described in section 3.4.6.3 of the Additional Module. 
4.9.4 Extraordinary rules governing the pro rata redemption of series A and D bonds  
Without prejudice to the ordinary rules governing the redemption of Series A and D Bonds, 
established in section 4.9.3. of this Securities Document, the principal of Series A, B, C and D will be 
redeemed on the Payment Date if any of the following situations occurs simultaneously:

(1) 
the ratio between the Outstanding Nominal Balance of Collection of combined Series B, C and 
D Bonds and the Outstanding Nominal Balance of Collection of Series A, B, C and D is double 
the ratio between the Outstanding Nominal Balance of Collection of combined Series B, C and 
D and the Outstanding Nominal Balance of Collection of Series A, B, C and D Bonds on the 
Date of Incorporation of the Fund. 
(2) 
that the Outstanding Nominal Balance of Collection of Mortgage Loans with, on a given date, 
payments outstanding for a period of more three (3) months, excluding loans underlying 
Defaulted Shares and the Certificates  (hereinafter referred to as “Debtor Mortgage Loans”), 
is below 2% of the Outstanding Nominal Balance Payable of the Bonds at that moment. 
(3) 
that, if the Outstanding Nominal Balance of Collection of the Shares and Certificates is less 
than 10% of its initial balance, the Sociedad Gestora does not opt for early redemption of the 
Fund. 
(4) 
that the Reserve Fund covers the initial level requested by the Rating Agencies (4,500,000 
Euro). 
4.9.5 Rules governing the redemption of series E bonds 
Series E Bonds will be amortised, after repayment of the principal, as from the Payment Date of 28 
January 2019, in the amount of Available Resources after the corresponding payments (i) to (xiii) in the 
Priority Order of Payments.  
4.9.6 Legal maturity date 
The Legal Maturity Date and, consequently, the final Bond redemption date is 26 October 2042 (the 
Payment Date immediately after the corresponding date to be added thirty (30) months prior to the final 
redemption date of the Mortgage Loans) or, if this is not a Business Day, and without prejudice to the 
Sociedad Gestora, on behalf and account of the Fund, and in conformity with the provisions contained in 
section 4.4.3. of the Registration Document, redeeming the Bonds prior to the Legal Maturity Date. The 
final redemption of the Bonds on the Legal Maturity Date will take place in accordance with the Priority 
Order of Liquidation Payments. 
4.9.7 Notice dates, calculation periods and calculation dates  
The Sociedad Gestora will notify the amount of principal and interest payable to Bondholders, as 
described in section (4.1) of the Additional Module of this Prospectus, on the second (2nd) Business Day 
prior to each Notice Date.  
In Its turn, “Calculation Periods” shall be calendar months. As an exception, the first Calculation 
Period shall be the period between the Incorporation Date and the final day in October, and the final 
Calculation Period shall be between the first day of the month on which liquidation of the Fund takes 
place and the Payment Date of such liquidation. 
Finally, “Calculation Date” is defined as the 20th each calendar month. On such date the Fund 
revenue for the immediately preceding Calculation Period shall be calculated, i.e.. The amount of 
principal plus interest effectively paid by the debtors, plus the Technical Advance requested on such 
date, minus the return of the Technical Advance requested on the preceding Calculation Date. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the above shall only apply where Collection Dates are in a monthly 
basis, and thus are coincident with Calculation Dates (20th of each month). In the event that a Collection 
Date should accrue on a weekly or daily basis, in accordance with section 3.4.5.1. of the Additional 
Module, the amounts mentioned in the preceding paragraph will not be paid, but instead the mount of 
principal and interest effectively paid by the debtors on the immediately preceding and the current 
Collection Date.

4.9.8 Early redemption of the bonds 
Irrespective of the Fund’s obligation, through the Sociedad Gestora, to redeem the Bonds of each 
Series on the Legal Maturity Date, (October 26th, 2042), or if it is not a Business Day, the next Business 
Day), or to execute partial redemptions on each Payment Date, as detailed above, the Sociedad Gestora 
is authorised to proceed with the early liquidation of the Fund and thus the early redemption on a 
Payment Date, of the entire Bond Issue, in accordance with the events of early liquidation and with the 
requirements detailed under section 4.4.3 of the Registration Document and with adherence to the 
Payment Priority Order set forth in section 3.4.6.3. of the Additional Module. 
4.10. Indication of the yield for the investor and calculation method 
The main characteristic of the Bonds of this Issue is that their regular redemption depends on the 
aggregate behaviour of the Mortgage Loans.  
The average life, yield, duration and final maturity of the Bonds of each Series depends on several 
factors, the most significant of which are as follows:  
a) The redemption system and timetable for each of the Mortgage Loans established in the related 
agreements. 
b) The capacity of the Mortgage Debtors to prepay, in full or in part, the Mortgage Loans and the speed 
at which such prepayment takes place in aggregate over the life of the Fund. 
c) The floating interest rates that will apply to each of the Mortgage Loans, which will cause the amount 
of each repayment instalment to vary. 
d) Delinquency of the debtors in making the Mortgage Loan repayments. 
In this regard, prepayments by the debtors of the Mortgage Loans are very significant. The 
prepayments are subject to continuous change and in this Prospectus are estimated using several 
assumptions for the future behaviour of the constant effective annual prepayment rate (hereinafter, 
“TAA”) which . This will have a direct bearing on the velocity at which the Bonds are redeemed and hence 
on their average life and duration.  
To calculate the data shown in the tables contained in this section, and given the uncertain nature of 
many of the parameters, the following assumptions have been made: 
1. The reference rate of the Bonds is deemed to remain constant during the life of the operation, using 
for this purpose the 3-month EURIBOR on October 5, 2005, at a rate of 1342.183%. The annual 
Nominal Interest Rates applicable to the Bonds of Series A,  B, C, D and E, variable quarterly, will be 
maintained constant throughout the term of the operation, at the following rates:

6,183% 
 
2. Amortisation based on a constant rate for the entire portfolio. To calculate the interest, we used the 
interest rate currently applied to the loan up to the fifth month (average weighted month at the 
portfolio review date) and then the 12-month EURIBOR set on the same date as the bond EURIBOR 
rate, whose value is 2.334%, plus the applicable margin. For IRPH (Mortgage Loan Reference Index) 
loans, a margin of 1.14% with respect to EURIBOR was considered.

3. Based on the assumption of a non-defaulted payment of 0% and a percentage of defaults of 0.30% 
as from October 31, 2006. 
4. The data were calculated for different scenarios of early redemption rates of mortgage loans and 
assuming early liquidation by the Sociedad Gestora when the Outstanding Nominal Balance pending 
Collection of the Mortgage Loans is less than 10% of their initial amount upon incorporation of the 
Fund. 
Consideration has also been given to the real data of the operation, such as the Closing Data, the 
Payment Dates, the fact that the theoretical redemption of the Bonds depends on the aggregate 
behaviour of the mortgage loans, the Bond redemption rules and the Bond reimbursement price. 
 
 
 
 
To calculate the average life of the Bonds, we used the following formula:  
 
 
where: 
V =  
Average life of each Series of the Bond issue expressed in years. 
Pn =  
Principal to be redeemed of each Bond Series at each Payment Date, according 
to the amount to be redeemed for each Bond Series, as described in section 
4.9.3 of this Securities Document. 
Dn =  
Number of days elapsed from the Disbursement Date until the Payment Date in 
question. 
T =  
Total nominal amount in of each Bond Series in euros. 
n=

amounts Pn will be paid.

To calculate the duration of the Bonds (Macaulay duration formula), we used the following formula:  
 
where: 
 
D = Duration of each Bond Series expressed in years. 
aj =  Time elapsed (in years) between the Disbursement Date and each of the n Payment 
Dates in question. 
VAj= Present value of each of the amounts comprising principal and gross interest 
payable on each of the n Payment Dates discounted at the internal rate of 
return (IRR) of each Series. 
PE=  Issue price of each Bond Series (100,000.00 €). 
i    = Effective yield (IRR) of each Series, as a decimal fraction of one. 
 
Nevertheless, when referring to duration, it must be taken into account that Bonds issued by the TDA 
IBERCAJA 2 Fund are variable-rate, a characteristic that has the consequences explained below. 
During the periods between interest rate revision dates, the market price of a variable-rate Bond will 
vary if market interest rates change. Nevertheless, its price will always be close to par on the interest 
rate revision date, since on that date the cost of holding the Bond may be refinanced under market 
conditions similar, with respect to the Bond, to those at the purchase date. Nevertheless, the price 
may not equal par on such a date if certain conditions and characteristics (market reference, 
applicable margin, revision period, average life of the Bond, final redemption of the Bond, etc.) at that

moment are valued differently by the market (better or worse) than the available investment 
alternatives. Except for this exception, however, it can be assumed that the price of a variable interest 
rate Bond is par on its interest rate revision dates. 
As a consequence of the foregoing, the duration of a variable-rate Bond must behave in a manner 
similar to a fixed-rate zero-coupon Bond maturing on the same date as the interest rate revision date 
of the variable-rate Bond. Therefore, on a given date, the approximate duration of Bonds, with a 
revision period of three months, can be assumed to be the remaining term until the next interest rate 
revision. 
The abovementioned value of the duration is obtained by applying the concept defined by Macaulay, 
but taking into consideration that changes in market interest rates will modify the flow of Bond 
payments (in favour of the Bondholder) which does not occur in the case of fixed-rate Bonds. 
The prepayment risk of the Bond, i.e. the uncertain nature of the amounts redeemed on each 
payment date, will affect the duration of the Bond in a very different manner depending on whether its 
interest rate is fixed or variable. While the effect is very important in the case of fixed-rate Bonds, 
since the duration depends largely on the average life of the Bond, it is not as important in the case of 
variable-rate Bonds because in this case the duration does not depend on the average life of the 
Bond but on the term remaining until the next modification of the interest rate. 
Final maturity: for each Series, the envisaged date for final redemption of the Bonds, assuming the 
Early Liquidation of the Fund and Early Redemption of the Bond Issue options are exercised when 
the Nominal Outstanding Balance of Collection of the Mortgage Loans is less than 10% of the initial 
Nominal Outstanding Balance.

Moody’s ratings for each Series of Bonds takes into account the structure of the Bond issue, the legal 
aspects of same, the characteristics of the Fund, the nature and characteristics of the Mortgage 
Loans and the regularity and continuity of flows in the operation. 
Moody’s rating is not an evaluation of the likelihood of Mortgage Debtors making early repayments of 
the principal, or the extent to which these payment differ from those originally envisaged. The rating 
does not constitute an assessment of the level of yield reported in actuarial tables. 
The ratings Moody’s assigns to each Bond series measure the expected loss before the Legal 
Maturity Date of the Fund. In Moody’s opinion, the structure allows the Fund to pay interest and 
principal during the life of the transaction, and in any event before the Legal Maturity Date. 
Moody’s has based its assessment on statements made by the entities participating in the 
transaction, by its auditors and lawyers, and by other experts in connection with the accuracy and 
completeness of the information provided in relation to the rating and subsequent monitoring. 
The rating awarded by Moody’s upon the creation of the Fund may be reviewed, suspended or 
withdrawn at any time, based on any information it receives. The initial rating, as well as any revision 
or suspension: 
(i) is formulated by Moody’s based on the considerable amount of information it receives, and in 
respect of which Moody’s gives no assurance as regards accuracy or completeness, hence Moody’s 
may not be considered liable in way for this information. 
(ii) does not constitute and cannot, accordingly, be interpreted in any manner as a recommendation 
or encouragement to Bondholders to proceed to perform any transaction in respect of the Bonds, and 
in particular, to buy, hold, retain, pledge or sell the Bonds.  
(iii) nor does it reflects the market conditions, or the possible needs of any particular investor. 
The rating assigned by S&P for the level of credit risk is the Agency’s opinion on the capacity of the 
Bonds to comply with the regular interest and principal payments during the term of the operation. 
S&P has issued no opinion on the Series E Bonds.  
S&P’s rating is based on the quality of the Shares and Certificates grouped in the Fund, on the credit 
enhancement available and on the legal and financial aspects of the Bond issue. 
The rating assigned by S&P is not an assessment of the probability of the Mortgage Debtors 
prepaying or repaying the principal of the Shares and Certificates. The rating does not in any way 
imply an assessment of the likely yield of the Bonds. 
S&P has based its assessment on statements made by the entities participating in the transaction, by 
its auditors and lawyers, and by other experts in connection with the accuracy and completeness of 
the information provided in relation to the rating and subsequent monitoring. 
The rating awarded by S&P upon the creation of the Fund may be reviewed, suspended or withdrawn 
at any time due to information it receives or due to the non-availability of information, or for any other 
reason. 
The rating assigned by S&P does not constitute a recommendation to buy, sell or retain the 
securities.

Standard & Poor’s applies a + or minus (-) sign in AA to  CCC categories to indicate the relative position 
within each category. 
Moody’s applies numbers 1,2 and 3 to each category from Aa to B, to indicate the relative position 
within each category, number 1 is the highest position within each category, number 2 is a medium 
position and number 3 is the lowest. 
Moody’s 
Meaning 
 
Aaa 
Interest payments are covered by a wide or exceptionally 
stable margin and possibilities of collection of the principal 
are certain 
Aa 
The fluctuation in the protection elements may or may not 
be greater, or there may not exist other elements that lead 
to the perception the long-term risk is higher that that of 
rated securities. 
A 
Strong rating as investment instruments and must be 
considered as medium-high quality securities.  The 
factors guaranteeing collection of capital and interest are 
sufficient, but there may be elements that suggest a 
possible deterioration in the future. 
Baa 
Payments of interest and principal are considered 
sufficiently well protected, but some protection elements 
may not exist or be unreliable in the long term  
Ba 
Speculative grade. Payments of principal and interest 
may be modestly protected and therefore vulnerable in 
the future. These securities are characterised by having 
an uncertain situation. 
B 
The certainty of fulfilling interest and principal payments 
may be limited in the long term  
Caa 
Poor quality.  These issues may have failed to comply 
with payment obligations already past due and may 
contain elements that endanger the collection of capital 
and interest. 
Ca

The Mortgage Loans have been granted by the Assignor, Caja de Ahorros y Monte de Piedad de 
Zaragoza, Aragón y Rioja (Ibercaja), in accordance with its standard procedures, which are described in 
the Fund’s “Internal Memorandum on the Granting of Mortgage Loans”, attached to the Deed of 
Incorporation, and summarised below: 
a) Description of the process 
At the customer’s request, the office performs an initial study and assessment to authorise the 
mortgage loan operation. 
b) Direct allocation (individual mortgages) 
Information on the operation is normally obtained during the first interview: characteristics of the 
property, loan period, financing needs, details of offers from other entities, etc. The customer is also 
given information on the range of products offered by the entity for this class of financing operation. 
Once the customer has considered the operation and provided all the documentation and information 
requested, the office starts to process and study the application. The application is automatically 
processed by the office, with the issuance of the appraisal, information from CIRBE and debtor files, as 
well as the legal report by the entity’s Legal Counselling Department, providing descriptions of the 
properties, the legal position of the participants and a summary of how to formalise the application to 
ensure it is correct from a legal standpoint. 
Once all the information has been obtained, an investment viability study is performed, including 
assessment using the scoring programme. The main criterion for authorising the operation is the analysis 
of the customer’s repayment capacity with respect to the requested operation within the periods 
established accordingly, taking into consideration additional guarantees to support the operation, but 
under no circumstances are a criterion for decision-taking purposes. 
Once all the data have been gathered, the office will decide whether or not to authorise the operation 
if it falls within the scope of capabilities, or to submit it for approval by a superior decision-taking body, 
accordingly. 
Once the operation has been authorised by the competent division, the documentation required to 
formalise same is prepared, the deed is signed before a Notary and the legal procedures required to 
complete the formalisation of the operation are carried out. 
Once the customer has submitted all the necessary documentation, the operation may be formalised 
within approximately eight to ten days. 
c) Promoter (subrogated loans) 
In the case of subrogated loans, the promoter must provide Ibercaja with a list of the buyers of 
properties, together with a copy of the private purchase contracts. The office contacts the customers to 
determine their relationship prior to the subrogation of the mortgage and to request the documentation it 
requires to study the operation. 
2.2.8 Indication of representations and warranties given to the issuer in respect of the 
assets 
The Assignor, as the holder of the Mortgage Loans, declares and guarantees the Fund and the 
Sociedad Gestora, with respect to itself, the Shares and Certificates it will issue and the Mortgage Loans

issued does not correspond to the aforementioned representations, it will inform the Sociedad Gestora 
and indicate the Mortgage Loans and/or transfer certificates that it intends to present to replace the faulty 
ones. In the event that any of the Shares and Certificates are substituted in accordance with these 
provisions, the Assignor will issue a new Multiple Deed, which will be substituted for the one provided in 
accordance with the agreement on the Date of Incorporation. 
The Assignor undertakes to formalise the replacement of Shares and/or Certificates in a public deed 
and in the form and term established by the Sociedad Gestora, and to provide any information regarding

these Shares and/or Certificates that the Sociedad Gestora deems appropriate. The replacement will be 
notified to the Rating Agencies and a copy of the deed will be sent to the CNMV. 
(B) In addition to the obligations assumed in (A) above, and in the exceptional cases in which 
substitution is not possible because the available Mortgage Loans are not similar to the 
securitised portfolio in terms of amount pending collection, term to maturity, interest rate, 
characteristics of the borrower, characteristics of the mortgaged property, live balance/appraisal 
value ratio, the Assignor agrees to the early redemption of the affected Share and/or Certificate 
and agrees to reimburse, in cash, both the outstanding principal of the corresponding Share 
and/or Certificate and the interest accrued and unpaid to date, together with any amount related 
to the Shares and/or Certificates corresponding to the Fund, by means of payment to the Fund. 
The Sociedad Gestora will set aside the amounts received from the early redemption of the 
Shares and/or Certificates affected by the situation described above for the redemption of the 
Bonds on the following Payment Date, subject to the Priority Payment Order described in section 
3.4.6.3 of the present Additional Module. 
Specifically, if the Assignor modifies the terms and conditions of the Mortgage Loans during the term 
of same without respecting the limits established in special applicable legislation and the terms and 
conditions agreed between the Fund and the Assignor in the Deed of Incorporation and in this 
Prospectus, in section 3.7.1. of this Additional Module, this will be treated as a breach by the Assignor of 
its obligations and must not be accepted by the Fund. In the event of such non-compliance, the Fund may 
demand, through the Sociedad Gestora, (i) the corresponding indemnity for damages and (ii) demand 
the replacement or reimbursement of the Shares and/or Certificates affected, in conformity with the 
provisions contained in sections (A) and (B) above, and this shall not mean that the Assignor guarantees 
the successful resolution of the operation, but rather that it shall take the necessary action to remedy the 
consequences of its failure to comply with its obligations, in conformity with Article 1.124 of the Civil 
Code. Any expenses incurred to remedy the non-compliance by the Assignor must be paid by the latter; 
these expenses may not be charged to the Fund. The Sociedad Gestora will inform immediately to the 
CNMV relating to the replacements or amortizations of the loans due to the Assignors' non-compliance.

complementary and subsidiary global insurance policy to guarantee damage insurance in the event that 
no such policy has been arranged for the property.

accrue interest from the Date of Incorporation (included), i.e. 13 October 2005, and therefore the interest 
accrued by the Mortgage Loans from that date will correspond to the Fund, regardless of the accrual 
period used to calculate the corresponding interest. 
The Assignor will not assume any liability whatsoever for the non-payment by the Mortgage Debtors of 
principal, interest or any other amount that may be due by virtue of the Mortgage Loans. The Assignor will 
not, under any circumstances, assume any responsibility in guaranteeing, either directly or indirectly, the 
success of the operation, nor will it give guarantees or warranties, nor enter into agreements for 
repurchasing Shares and Certificates, neither by virtue of the Deed of Incorporation of the Fund nor by 
virtue of any other pact or contract. 
The Assignor will be responsible to the Fund for the existence and validity of the Mortgage Loans as 
indicated in Article 348 of the Commercial Code and Article 1,529 of the Civil Code. 
3.3.2 Issue price of shares and certificates 
The Sociedad Gestora shall subscribe 100% of the Shares and Certificates on behalf of the Fund on 
the Date of Incorporation of same. 
The price of the Shares and Certificates will be the Outstanding Nominal Balance of Collection of 
same, and will be paid by the Sociedad Gestora, in the name and on the account of  the Fund, to the 
Assignor on the Disbursement Date, i.e. 18 October 2005. 
In the event of cancellation of the incorporation of the Fund and, consequently, of the issue and

right accrued in favour of the Fund by the Shares and Certificates. 
3.3.3 Description of rights of the fund from the subscription of the shares and certificates: 
As holder of the Shares and Certificates, the Fund will own the rights acknowledged by current 
applicable legislation and the rights inherent in the Shares and Certificates. Specifically, it will have the 
right to receive the payments made by the Mortgage Debtors from the Date of Incorporation onwards, 
with the exceptions envisaged in the following paragraph, together with any other payment arising from 
the Mortgage Loans, provided such payments correspond to the Shares and Certificates. The Shares 
and Certificates will begin to accrue interest from the Date of Incorporation. 
In addition to the payments made by the Mortgage Debtors, any other payment received by the 
Assignor from the Mortgage Loans, including those arising from any ancillary rights to the Mortgage 
Loans such as compensation derived from insurance policies, payments made by possible guarantors, 
etc., must be made by the Fund, as the administrator of same, with the exception of commissions arising 
from delinquent interest, unpaid receipt claims, subrogation and prepayment fees, together with any 
other commission that may correspond to the Assignor of the Shares and Certificates.  
Additionally, the Fund will have the right to receive the amounts, assets or payment rights of principal 
or interest of the Mortgage Loans, either for the sale price or for the amount established by judicial or 
notary resolution in the foreclosure of the mortgages, for the sale or exploitation of the properties 
foreclosed or as a consequence of said foreclosures, in administration and internal possession of the 
properties undergoing foreclosure. The Assignor will make necessary notifications so that the payments 
to the Sociedad Gestora are made.

out in relation to the Mortgage Loans, and will be responsible for any damage incurred by the Fund in the 
event of failure to maintain the insurance policies.

3.3.4 Representation and custody of the shares and certificates  
The Shares and Certificates grouped in the Fund are represented in two Multiple Deeds, one 
representing the entire issue of Mortgage Share Certificates, and the other representing the entire issue 
of Mortgage Transfer Certificates. 
Both if the Sociedad Gestora executes a Mortgage Loan for and on behalf of the Fund, as established 
in section 3.7.1.2.2. of this Additional Module, and if, in the event of Early Liquidation of the Fund in the 
circumstances and conditions envisaged in section 4.4. of the Registration Document, the Mortgage 
Transfer Certificates must be sold, as well as in any other event that so requires, the Assignor undertakes 
to fraction any multiple security representing the Shares and/or Certificates into as many individual or 
multiple securities as necessary or to substitute or exchange them in order to achieve the 
abovementioned objectives. 
The Multiple Deeds representing the Shares and Certificates and, where appropriate, the individual 
securities into which these are fractioned, will be deposited with the Financial Agent, which shall act as 
the custodian of same. 
3.4. 
Explanation of fund flows 
3.4.1 How the flows from the assets will help the issuer to comply with its commitments to 
the bondholders 
As shown in the diagram in section 3.1 of this Additional Module, the asset flows will help the Issuer to 
comply with its obligations, as follows: 
a) On the Disbursement Date, the Fund will pay the price of the Shares and Certificates issued from 
the amount of principal received from Series A, B, C and D Bonds. 
b) On the aforementioned Disbursement Date, the Fund will also receive the amount corresponding 
to the Initial Expenses Loan in order to pay same. 
c) Equally, on the abovementioned Disbursement Date the Reserve Fund will be provisioned with 
the amount of principal received from Series E Bonds. 
d) On each Collection Date, the Sociedad Gestora, in the name and representation of the Fund, will 
receive the amounts of principal and interest paid by the Mortgage Debtors. These amounts will 
be deposited in the Reinvestment Account, accruing interest at a rate in accordance with the rate 
envisaged in the Agreement to Open a Guaranteed Interest Account (Reinvestment Account), 
which will be used to cover Fund payments on each Payment Date. 
e) An Financial Interest Swap Agreement has also been signed that will increase or reduce the 
Available Resources for payment to the Bonds, depending on whether the net amount is whether 
the net amount is in favour of the Fund or the counteritem, respectively. 
f) The amounts received from the Mortgage Loans corresponding to each of the three Calculation 
Periods and the interest accrued on the Reinvestment Account, and, where appropriate, the 
amounts paid in by the Financial Interest Swap Agreement, on each Payment Date, will be 
applied in accordance with the Priority Order of Payments. 
g) Certain additional measures have been envisaged as protective measures in the event of adverse 
situations or changes in circumstances, such as the Reserve Fund, which the Fund may use to 
make payments to Bondholders.

h) Once all the obligations of the Fund described above have been satisfied, available surplus 
resources of the Fund will be reimbursed to Ibercaja on the Payment Date through the payment of 
remuneration by Financial Intermediation, as defined in section .3.4.6.6. of this Additional Module. 
3.4.2 Information on all credit enhancements 
A number of financial mechanisms have been incorporated to provide credit enhancement and 
liquidity support to the Bonds. Without prejudice to the detailed study included in the following sections of 
other instruments that may be treated as credit enhancement instruments, we will now analyse the 
Reserve Fund and the Financial Interest Swap Agreement. 
A Reserve Fund will be established as a guarantee mechanism and in order to allow payments by the 
Fund to the Bondholders of the A, B, C and D Bonds in accordance with the Priority Order of Payments 
established in section 3.4.6.3. of this Additional Module, the features whereof are as provided in section 
3.4.3.4. of this Additional Module. 
3.4.2.1. 
The sociedad gestora will, on behalf of the fund, sign with ibercaja a financial 
interest swap agreement (hereinafter referred to as the “interest swap 
agreement”); the most relevant terms and conditions of this agreement are 
described in section 3.4.7.1. of the additional module: 
The Interest Swap Agreement stems from the need to eliminate, on the one hand, the interest rate risk 
arising as a result of the Shares and Certificates being affected by variable interest rates with reference 
rates and revision periods,  different to the liquidation of variable interest established for each Series of 
Bonds issued against the Fund; and, on the other, the risk, under legislation governing the modification 
and subrogation of mortgage loans, of the Shares and Certificates being renegotiated to reduce the 
agreed interest rate. 
The Fund shall have, in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement to Open an Account at a 
Guaranteed Interest Rate, a bank account in the name of the Fund (hereinafter the “Reinvestment 
Account”), through which on each Collection  Date, all payments receivable by the Fund from the 
Assignor shall be made, in accordance with the provisions of section 3.4.4.1 of the Additional Module. 
Furthermore, subordination and priority for payment of interest and reimbursement of principal 
between the different Bond Series derived from their position in the Priority Payment Order constitutes a 
differentiated protection mechanism between the Series. 
3.4.3 Details of any subordinated debt financing 
The Assignor will award a Subordinated Loan and an Initial Expenses Loan to the Fund. The main 
terms and conditions of these loans are described below.  
3.4.3.1. 
Loan for initial expenses 
The Assignor will grant, in accordance with the Initial Expenses Loan Agreement, a Subordinated 
Loan to the Fund (hereinafter referred to as the “Initial Expenses Loan”) for a maximum amount 000 to 
be determined two (2) days prior to the Disbursement Date, when the final underwriting fees shall be set. 
The total maximum amount of the Initial Expenses Loan to be granted to the Fund shall be one million 
two hundred and fifty thousand (1,250,000) Euros. 
The amount will be used by the Sociedad Gestora to pay the initial expenses of the Fund 
corresponding to incorporation thereof and the issuance of the Bonds. 
The Initial Expenses Loan will accrue a variable interest rate equal to the Reference Interest Rate of 
the Bonds current at any time plus a margin of 0.75%; the payment will be subject to the Priority Order of 
Payments described in section 3.4.6.3. of this Additional Module.

77 
The principal of the Initial Expenses Loan will be repaid in twenty (20) equal and consecutive 
instalments, the first of which will take place on the first Payment Date (26 January 2006) and the rest on 
the following Payment Dates, all in accordance with the Priority Order described in section 3.4.6.3. of this 
Additional Module. 
All amounts that, pursuant to the above paragraphs, are not provided to the Assignor shall be paid on 
subsequent Payment Dates when Available Resources allow in accordance with the Priority Order of 
Payments and shall be payable with preference to any amounts payable in respect of the Initial Expenses 
Loan on such Payment Date. The amounts owed to the Assignor and not paid as provided in the 
aforementioned paragraphs, will not accrue penalty interest in its favour. 
Remuneration of the Initial Expenses Loan shall take place based on an annual floating interest rate 
which, on a quarterly basis shall be equal to the Reference Interest Rate of the Bonds set for each 
Interest Accrual Period, plus a margin of 0.75%. Such interest shall be payable only if the Fund should 
have sufficient cash in accordance with the Priority Payment Order of the Fund. Interest shall be settled 
on each Payment Date, and shall be calculated on the basis of: (i) the effective number of days between 
each Interest Accrual Period, and (ii) a three hundred and sixty day (360) year. Payment of such interest 
shall be subject to the Priority Payment Order provided in section 3.4.6.3. of the Additional Module. 
Absence of confirmation prior to the Subscription Period of the provisional ratings awarded to the 
Bonds by the Rating Agencies shall constitute an event of termination of the Initial Expenses Loan. 
3.4.3.2. 
Subordinated loan 
The Assignor will grant, in accordance with the Subordinated Loan Agreement, a Subordinated Loan 
to the Fund (hereinafter referred to as the “Subordinated Loan”) for a total amount of two million 
(2,000,000) Euros. 
The amount of the Subordinated Loan will be paid prior to the Business Day prior to the first Payment 
Date into the Fund’s Account opened with the Financial Agent. 
The amount of the Subordinated Loan will be used by the Sociedad Gestora to cover the deficit of the 
Fund, on the first Payment Date, between the interest accrued and interest paid of the Shares and 
Certificates.  
The Subordinated Loan will accrue variable interest at an annual rate equal on a quarterly basis to the 
Reference Interest Rate of the Bonds set for each Interest Accrual Period, plus a margin of 0.75%. . 
Interest shall be settled on each Payment Date, and shall be calculated on the basis of: (i) the effective 
number of days between each Interest Accrual Period, and (ii) a three hundred and sixty day (360) year. 
Payment of such interest will be subject to the Priority Order of Payments envisaged in section 3.4.6.3. of 
the Additional Module. 
The Subordinated Loan will mature on the Fund liquidation date. However, the Subordinated Loan 
may be freely repaid on each Payment Date; the Sociedad Gestora will determine the amount that will be 
set aside for the aforementioned repayment according to the estimated resources required to cover 
deficits between accruals and collections from the Shares and Certificates for the Fund.  
All amounts payable to the Assignor that accrue in connection with interest and principal repayment, in 
respect of the Subordinated Loan, will be subject to the Priority Order of Payments established in section 
3.4.6.3. of this Additional Module, and consequently they will only be paid to the Assignor on a specific 
Payment Date if the Available Resources of the Fund on that Payment Date are sufficient to meet the 
Fund commitments listed in positions (i) to (xv) of the Priority Order of Payments and (i) to (xvii) in the 
case of the principal.  
All amounts that, pursuant to the above paragraphs, are not delivered to the Assignor will be paid on 
subsequent Payment Dates when Available Resources allow, in accordance with the established Priority 
Order of Payments and shall be payable with preference to amounts payable in respect of the 
Subordinated Loan on such Payment Date.

The amounts owed to the Assignor and not paid as provided in the aforementioned paragraphs, will 
not accrue penalty interest in its favour.

Bonds by the Rating Agencies shall constitute an event of termination of the Subordinated Loan.

The Series D Bonds are subordinated as to the payment of interest and reimbursement of principal to 
Series A, B and C Bonds. Series C Bonds are subordinated as to the payment of interest and 
reimbursement of principal to Series A and B Bonds. Series B Bonds are subordinated as to the payment 
of interest and reimbursement of principal to Series A Bonds.. All of this is in accordance with the Priority 
Payment Order set forth in section 3.4.6.3 of the Additional Module. 
Sections 4.6.1 and 4.6.2 of the Securities Document provide details of the positions in the priority 
payment order of the Fund of payment of interest and reimbursement of principal of each Bond Series.

The balances of the Reinvestment Account will be maintained in cash. Balances resulting from the 
Reinvestment Account, in favour of the Fund, will not be used, under any circumstances, by the Assignor 
to compensate any debt with the Fund or related third parties, except with prior written authorisation from 
the Sociedad Gestora.

Payment schedule

Account on the 20th day of each month (hereinafter referred to as the “Collection Dates”). The frequency 
of these payments may decrease if the Rating Agencies reduce the rating of the Assignor, as the 
administrator of the Mortgage Loans. 
 
In the event that the Assignor’s short term rating by S&P  is downgraded by S&P to a rating below A-2, or 
such rating is suspended by S&P, for whatever reason, the Assignor shall pay on a daily basis into the 
Reinvestment Account opened with the Assignor (if the guarantee mentioned in point (ii) section 3.4.4.1 
is maintained) or in the account opened with another entity mentioned in point (i) section 3.4.4.1.  
In the event that the Assignor’s short term rating by Moody’s  is downgraded by Moody’s to a rating 
below P-1, or such rating is suspended by Moody’s, for whatever reason, the Assignor shall pay on a 
weekly basis into the Reinvestment Account opened with the Assignor (if the guarantee mentioned in 
point (ii) of the preceding paragraph is maintained) or in the account opened with another entity

be the greater of the foregoing amounts in the event of a reduction of both ratings. 
Additionally, “Collection Notice Period” will be the period between two Collection Dates . 
Technical Advance 
Taking into account that some of the delays in the payments made by the Mortgage Debtors are of an 
interim or technical nature, and in order to avoid such delays having a negative impact on the flow of 
payments to the Bondholders, and taking into account that there is also a lapse of 20 days between the 
end of the Calculation Period and the Calculation Date on behalf of the Fund, and that the amounts 
collected by the Assignor as Loan administrator are the property of the Fund, the Sociedad Gestora, on 
behalf of the Fund, will be entitled to receive on every Collection Date an advance backed by such 
amounts, which will be deposited in the Reinvestment Account (hereinafter, the “Technical Advance”).  
The amount of the Technical Advance cannot exceed the amount collected by the Assignor and not 
transferred from the Mortgage Loans it administers, for any payment that the Fund will be entitled to 
receive as holder of the Shares and Certificates, until the Calculation Date on which the Technical 
Advance is requested. 
The Sociedad Gestora will calculate the Technical Advance as an amount equal to the sum of the 
amounts matured and not yet collected by the Assignor, during the previous Calculation Period, for 
principal and interest from the Shares and Certificates in arrears up to thirty (30) days at the end of the 
previous Calculation Date on which the Technical Advance is requested, taking into account the
