IMPORTANT NOTICE – PROSPECTUS 
YOU MUST READ THE FOLLOWING BEFORE CONTINUING. THE FOLLOWING APPLIES TO THE 
PROSPECTUS FOLLOWING THIS PAGE AND YOU ARE THEREFORE ADVISED TO READ THIS 
CAREFULLY BEFORE READING, ACCESSING OR MAKING ANY OTHER USE OF THE PROSPECTUS. 
IN ACCESSING THE PROSPECTUS, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND 
CONDITIONS, INCLUDING ANY MODIFICATIONS THERETO. 
The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to, and should not be offered, 
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). For these 
purposes, a retail investor means a person who is:  
(a) 
a “retail client” as defined in point (11) of article 4(1) of directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MIFID 
II”);  
(b) 
a “customer” within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended, the “Insurance 
Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined 
in point (10) of article 4(1) of MIFID II; and/or  
(c) 
not a “qualified investor” as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and 
of the Council of 14 June 2017 on the prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the 
public or admitted to trading on a regulated market, and repealing directive 2003/71/EC (as 
amended, the “Prospectus Regulation”). 
Consequently, no key information document (KID) required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as 
amended, the “EU PRIIPS Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them 
available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or 
otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the EU PRIIPS 
Regulation. 
The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to, and should not be offered, 
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (the “UK”). For these 
purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of the following:  
(a) 
a retail client, as defined in point (8) of article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of 
the domestic law of the UK by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended, 
“EUWA”);  
(b) 
a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 
(FSMA) and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement the Insurance Distribution 
Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of 
article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of the domestic law of the UK by virtue 
of the EUWA; and/or  
(c) 
not a qualified investor as defined in article 2 of the Prospectus Regulation as it forms part of the 
domestic law of the UK by virtue of the EUWA.  
Consequently, no key information document required by the EU PRIIPS Regulation as it forms part of the 
domestic law of the UK by virtue of the EUWA (as amended, the “UK PRIIPS Regulation”) for offering or 
selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and 
therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK 
may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPS Regulation. 
NOTHING IN THIS PROSPECTUS CONSTITUTES AN OFFER TO SELL OR A SOLICITATION OF AN 
OFFER TO BUY THE NOTES DESCRIBED IN THE PROSPECTUS IN ANY JURISDICTION WHERE IT 
IS UNLAWFUL TO DO SO. ANY FORWARDING, DISTRIBUTION OR REPRODUCTION OF THE 
PROSPECTUS IN WHOLE OR IN PART IS UNAUTHORISED.

FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THIS DIRECTIVE MAY RESULT IN A VIOLATION OF THE US 
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 (AS AMENDED, THE “UNITED STATES SECURITIES ACT”) OR THE 
APPLICABLE LAWS OF OTHER JURISDICTIONS. 
The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the United States Securities Act or the securities 
laws of any state of the United States or other relevant jurisdiction. The Notes may not at any time be 
offered, sold or delivered within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, any person who 
is a U.S. Person (as defined in Regulation S under the United States Securities Act (“Regulation S”)) by 
any person referred to in Rule 903(b)(2)(iii) of Regulation S, (x) as part of their distribution at any time or 
(y) otherwise until 40 calendar days after the completion of the distribution of the securities as determined 
and certified by the Joint Lead Managers, in either case except in accordance with Regulation S.  
EXCEPT WITH THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF THE SELLER (AS DEFINED IN SECTION 3.1.2 
OF THE SECURITIES NOTE BELOW) (A U.S. RISK RETENTION CONSENT) AND WHERE SUCH SALE 
FALLS WITHIN THE EXEMPTION PROVIDED BY SECTION 20 OF THE FINAL RULES PROMULGATED 
UNDER SECTION 15G OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (THE U.S. 
RISK RETENTION RULES), THE NOTES ISSUED BY THE ISSUER AND OFFERED AND SOLD BY THE 
JOINT LEAD MANAGERS MAY NOT BE PURCHASED BY, OR FOR THE ACCOUNT OR BENEFIT OF, 
ANY “U.S. PERSON” AS DEFINED IN THE U.S. RISK RETENTION RULES (RISK RETENTION U.S. 
PERSONS). PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS SHOULD NOTE THAT THE DEFINITION OF “U.S. PERSON” 
IN THE U.S. RISK RETENTION RULES IS SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO, BUT NOT IDENTICAL TO, 
THE DEFINITION OF “U.S. PERSON” IN REGULATION S. EACH PURCHASER OF THE NOTES, OR A 
BENEFICIAL INTEREST THEREIN, ACQUIRED IN THE INITIAL SYNDICATION OF THE NOTES BY 
ITS ACQUISITION OF THE NOTES, OR A BENEFICIAL INTEREST THEREIN, WILL BE DEEMED TO 
HAVE MADE CERTAIN REPRESENTATIONS AND IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES WILL BE 
REQUIRED TO MAKE CERTAIN REPRESENTATIONS AND AGREEMENTS (INCLUDING AS A 
CONDITION TO ACCESSING OR OTHERWISE OBTAINING A COPY OF THIS PROSPECTUS OR 
OTHER OFFERING MATERIALS RELATING TO THE NOTES), TO THE ISSUER, THE ORIGINATOR, 
THE MANAGEMENT COMPANY, THE ARRANGER AND THE JOINT LEAD MANAGERS (EACH AS 
DEFINED BELOW) AND ON WHICH EACH OF SUCH PERSONS WILL RELY WITHOUT ANY 
INVESTIGATION, INCLUDING THAT IT (1) EITHER (I) IS NOT A RISK RETENTION U.S. PERSON 
OR (II) HAS OBTAINED A U.S. RISK RETENTION CONSENT FROM THE SELLER, (2) IS ACQUIRING 
SUCH NOTE, OR BENEFICIAL INTEREST THEREIN, FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT AND NOT WITH A 
VIEW TO DISTRIBUTE SUCH NOTE, AND (3) IS NOT ACQUIRING SUCH NOTE, OR BENEFICIAL 
INTEREST THEREIN, AS PART OF A SCHEME TO EVADE THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE U.S. RISK 
RETENTION RULES (INCLUDING ACQUIRING SUCH NOTE THROUGH A NON-RISK RETENTION 
U.S. PERSON, RATHER THAN A RISK RETENTION U.S. PERSON, AS PART OF A SCHEME TO EVADE 
THE 10 PER CENT. RISK RETENTION U.S. PERSON LIMITATION IN THE EXEMPTION PROVIDED 
FOR IN SECTION 20 OF THE U.S. RISK RETENTION RULES). 
The transaction will not involve the retention by the Seller of at least 5 per cent. of the credit risk of the 
securitised assets for the purposes of the U.S. Risk Retention Rules. The Seller intends to rely on the 
exemption provided for in Section 20 of the U.S. Risk Retention Rules regarding non-U.S. transactions that 
meet certain requirements. No other steps have been taken by the Originator, the Arranger or the Joint 
Lead Managers or any of their affiliates or any other party to otherwise comply with the U.S. Risk Retention 
Rules. See section 3.4.3.2 of the Additional Information “US Risk Retention” below.  
IN ORDER TO BE ELIGIBLE TO READ THE PROSPECTUS OR MAKE AN INVESTMENT DECISION 
WITH RESPECT TO THE NOTES DESCRIBED THEREIN, YOU MUST NOT BE A “U.S. PERSON” AS

representations and agreements (including as a condition to accessing or otherwise obtaining a copy of 
this Prospectus or other offering materials relating to the Notes), to the Issuer, the Originator, the 
Management Company, the Arranger and the Joint Lead Managers (each as defined below) and on which 
each of such persons will rely without any investigation, that (i) you have understood the agreed terms

Securities Act) or, in relation to the offer, sale or delivery of the Notes, acting for the account or benefit of

of the Notes is not located in the United States, its territories and possessions (including Puerto Rico, the

IMPORTANT NOTICE: MIFID II PRODUCT GOVERNANCE 
Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in 
respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: 
(a) 
Target market: the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients 
only, each as defined in MIFID II; and 
(b) 
Channels of distribution: all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and 
professional clients are appropriate.  
Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into 
consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is 
responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting 
or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution 
channels.

IMPORTANT NOTICE: UK MIFIR PRODUCT GOVERNANCE 
Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process (to the extent such manufacturer 
would be deemed to be a manufacturer under UK MIFIR), the target market assessment in respect of the 
Notes in the UK has led to the conclusion that: 
(a) 
Target market: the target market for the Notes is only eligible counterparties as defined in the 
FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“COBS”) and professional clients as defined in 
Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of the domestic law of the UK by virtue of the EUWA 
(as amended, “UK MiFIR”); and 
(b) 
Channels of distribution: all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and 
professional clients are appropriate.  
Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into 
consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA 
Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product 
Governance Rules”) is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the 
Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining 
appropriate distribution channels.

IMPORTANT NOTICE – UK AFFECTED INVESTORS 
The Securitisation Regulations 2024 made by the United Kingdom’s Treasury on 29 January 2024, 
(as amended, the “SR 2024”), together with (i) the securitisation sourcebook of the handbook of 
rules and guidance adopted by the Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”) of the United Kingdom 
(the “UK”) (the “SECN”), (ii) the Securitisation Part of the rulebook of published policy of the 
Prudential Regulation Authority of the Bank of England (the “PRA”) (the “PRASR”) and (iii) relevant 
provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (as amended, the “FSMA”), set out the 
framework for the regulation of securitisation in the UK (collectively, the “UK Securitisation 
Framework”). Regulations 32B to 32D (inclusive) of the SR 2024, SECN 4 and Article 5 of Chapter 
2 of the PRASR, as applicable, place certain conditions on investments in a “securitisation” (as defined 
in the SR 2024) (the “UK Due Diligence Requirements”) by an “institutional investor” (as defined in the 
SR 2024). The UK Due Diligence Requirements also apply to investments by certain consolidated affiliates, 
wherever established or located, of such institutional investors which are entities subject to Regulation 
(EU) No 575/2013, as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (such affiliates, together 
with all such institutional investors, “UK Affected Investors”). Further consultations and reforms relating 
to the UK securitisation regime (including a review of the reporting templates required under the UK 
Securitisation Framework) are expected in 2025, although timings are potentially subject to change. While 
the UK Securitisation Framework which took effect on 1 November 2024 effects some alignment with the 
EU regime, this new framework has also introduced new points of divergence and further divergence in 
the future between EU and UK regimes cannot be ruled out. 
As of the date of this Prospectus, the UK Securitisation Framework is not applicable to the Seller or the 
Fund. 
Neither the Originator nor any other party to the transaction described in this Prospectus will retain or 
commit to retain a 5% material net economic interest with respect to this transaction in accordance with 
the UK Securitisation Framework or makes or intends to make any representation or agreement that it or 
any other party is undertaking or will undertake to take or refrain from taking any action to facilitate or 
enable the compliance by UK Affected Investors with the UK Due Diligence Requirements, or to comply 
with the requirements of any other law or regulation now or hereafter in effect in the UK in relation to risk 
retention, due diligence and monitoring, credit granting standards or any other conditions with respect to 
investments in securitisation transactions by UK Affected Investors. The arrangements described in section 
3.4.3 and section 4.2 of the Additional Information and elsewhere in this Prospectus have not been 
structured with the objective of ensuring compliance with the requirements of the UK Securitisation 
Framework by any person. 
Failure by a UK Affected Investor to comply with the UK Due Diligence Requirements with respect to an 
investment in the Notes offered by this Prospectus may result in regulatory sanctions being imposed by 
the competent authority of such UK Affected Investor (including the imposition of a higher regulatory 
capital charges on that investment). 
The UK Securitisation Framework also includes criteria and procedures in relation to the designation of 
securitisations as simple, transparent and standardised, or STS, within the meaning of regulation 9(1) of 
the SR 2024 (“UK STS”). The transaction described in this Prospectus is not intended to be designated as 
a UK STS securitisation for the purposes of the UK Securitisation Framework. Pursuant to article 12(3) of 
the SR 2024, a securitisation which meets the requirements for an STS-Securitisation for the purposes of 
EU Securitisation Regulation, which is notified to the European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”) 
in accordance with the applicable requirements before 11 p.m. on 30th June 2026, and which is included in 
the ESMA List may be deemed to satisfy the “STS” requirements for the purposes of the UK Securitisation 
Framework. No assurance can be provided that this transaction does or will continue to meet the STS 
requirements or to qualify as an STS-Securitisation under the EU Securitisation Regulation or pursuant to 
article 12(3) of the SR 2024 at any point in time. 
Prospective UK Affected Investors are themselves responsible for analysing their own regulatory position 
and should consult their own advisers in this respect and should consider (and where appropriate, take 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 – Important Information 
Page 9 
independent advice on) the application of the UK Securitisation Framework or other applicable regulations 
and the suitability of the Notes for investment. 
None of the Seller (as originator) or the Fund (as SSPE) under the UK Securitisation Regulation are actively 
seeking to comply with the requirements of the UK Securitisation Framework. UK investors should be aware 
of this and should note that their regulatory position may be affected. The transaction will not be a UK STS 
Transaction and will therefore not be notified to the FCA for that purpose.

RISK FACTORS 
_______________________ 
 
THE CONTENTS OF THE RISK FACTORS RELATED TO THE UNDERLYING ASSETS, THE NATURE OF THE 
SECURITIES AND THE NATURE OF THE ISSUER INCLUDED IN “RISK FACTORS” SECTION OF THIS 
PROSPECTUS HAVE BEEN DRAFTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE 16 OF THE PROSPECTUS 
REGULATION. THEREFORE, GENERIC RISKS REGARDING THE UNDERLYING ASSETS, THE NATURE OF THE 
SECURITIES AND THE NATURE OF THE ISSUER HAVE NOT BEEN INCLUDED IN THIS PROSPECTUS IN 
ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH ARTICLE 16. YOU ARE EXPECTED TO CONDUCT YOUR OWN ASSESSMENT AND 
INQUIRY OF THE GENERIC RISKS DERIVED FROM THE UNDERLYING ASSETS, THE NATURE OF THE 
SECURITIES AND THE NATURE OF THE ISSUER. 
1. 
RISKS DERIVED FROM THE SECURITIES 
1.1. 
Related to the underlying assets 
1.1.1. 
RISK OF PAYMENT DEFAULT OF THE BORROWERS  
Noteholders and the creditors of the Fund shall bear the risk of payment default by the 
Borrowers of the Receivables pooled in the Fund. In particular, in the event that the losses of 
the Receivables pooled in the Fund were higher than the credit enhancements described in 
section 3.4.2.1 of the Additional Information, this circumstance could potentially jeopardise 
the payment of principal and/or interest under the Notes and/or the Start-Up Expenses Loan 
Agreement.  
The Seller does not assume the risk of payment default of the Receivables and, therefore, 
shall accept no liability whatsoever for the Borrowers’ default of principal, interest or any 
other amount due under the Loan agreements. Pursuant to article 348 of the Spanish 
Commercial Code and article 1,529 of the Spanish Civil Code, the Seller will only be 
responsible to the Fund for the existence and lawfulness of the Receivables, in the terms and 
conditions set forth in this Prospectus, the Deed of Incorporation and the Sale and Purchase 
Agreement, as well as for the legal status under which the transfer of the Receivables is 
performed. The Seller assumes no responsibility for or in any way warrants the successful 
outcome of the transaction and no guarantees will be granted by any public or private entity, 
including the Management Company, the Seller or any of their affiliate or investee companies. 
Moreover, the Seller does not undertake to repurchase the Receivables except for the 
repurchase obligation foreseen in section 2.2.9 of the Additional Information. 
Level of payment default by Borrowers under the Receivables may be additionally impacted 
by, amongst others, fluctuations in general economic conditions and other factors linked to 
household income, which may have an impact on the ability of the Borrowers to meet their 
payment obligations under the Loans. Any deterioration of the macroeconomic situation could 
potentially have an adverse effect on the ability of Borrowers to meet their payment 
obligations under the Loans and, ultimately, the ability of the Fund to make payments under 
the Notes. The macroeconomic potential effects are further described in the risk factor located 
in section 1.1.2 below. 
Moreover, unemployment, loss of earnings, illness, divorce, losses of subsidies and other 
similar factors negatively impacting household incomes may also lead to an increase in 
delinquencies and insolvency filings by the Borrowers, which may in turn have an adverse 
effect on the ability of the Borrowers to meet their payment obligations under the Loans and, 
ultimately, the ability of the Fund to make payments under the Notes. 
For illustrative purposes: 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 - Risk Factors 
Page 15 
 
Tables with historical information of defaults and recovery rates of the Seller’s 
consumer loan portfolio are displayed at the end of section 2.2.7.3 of the Additional 
Information. The estimated cash flows displayed in section 4.10 of the Securities Note 
have been calculated considering a constant default rate (CDR) of 1.60% (annual) with 
an average recovery rate of 23% at twenty-four (24) months, that are consistent with 
the rates of the Seller’s portfolio of equivalent loans. 
For the purposes of this Prospectus, such “portfolio of equivalent loans” refers to a 
portfolio of consumer loans within the Seller’s total portfolio, whose characteristics are 
comparable to the Preliminary Portfolio and that is the object of the tables and data 
shown in section 2.2.7.3 of the Additional Information. In particular, the portfolio of 
equivalent loans complies with the following criteria (i) no loan has or shall have an 
outstanding balance higher than € 100,000, (ii) no Receivable derives from a 
Restructured Receivable, (iii) each loan has a Regulatory PD (probability of default) 
equal to or less than 6% (i.e., loans classified as Stage 2 would be excluded); (iv) and 
loans granted to new clients are excluded. 
 
As described in section 4.10 of the Securities Note, the loss ratio at maturity is 2.02%, 
assuming (i) a CPR of 15%; and (ii) that the Management Company, acting on behalf 
of the Fund, proceeds to the Early Liquidation of the Fund, and following the 
instructions of the Seller, as established by section 4.4.3.2(i) of the Registration 
Document when the Outstanding Balance of the Receivables falls below 10% of the 
Outstanding Balance of the Receivables on the Date of Incorporation. 
Prospective investors in the Notes should be aware that higher annual constant default rates 
and/or lower recovery rates than expected could adversely affect the creditworthiness of the 
Borrowers and their capacity to repay the Loans from which the Receivables backing the 
Notes arise. 
1.1.2. 
RISK RESULTING FROM THE MACROECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL CONDITIONS 
Numerous factors have affected or may affect the economy and the financial markets in the 
coming months or years, having economic and financial repercussions.  
According to the last reports “ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the Euro area – March 
2025”, and “Bank of Spain’s Macroeconomic projections for the Spanish economy – March 
2025” the key macroeconomic parameters are as follows: 
 
2025 
2026 
2027 
GDP 
 
 
 
- 
Spain 
2.7% 
1.9% 
1.7% 
- 
EU 
0.9% 
1.2% 
1.3% 
Inflation 
 
 
 
- 
Spain 
2.5% 
1.7% 
2.4% 
- 
EU 
2.3% 
1.9% 
2.0% 
 
In addition, growing geopolitical tensions, amongst others, in Eastern Europe (particularly, in 
Ukraine) and in Middle East (particularly in Israel, Lebanon, the Red Sea and in the Bab-el-
Mandeb strait), may add pressure to the global supply chain, which potentially can also have 
negative effects on world trade and hinder economic growth. 
High consumer and commodity prices, a decline in inflation lower than expected and an 
evolution of the economy which is worse than expected may have an adverse effect on the 
financial condition of the Borrowers and hence, on their ability to repay their existing debt 
under the Loans. Amongst other factors, geopolitical conflicts, trade tariffs under the United 
States administration could impact the Spanish and global economies and may cause the 
main macroeconomic forecasts to deviate from the projections made. Such tariffs could have 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 - Risk Factors 
Page 16 
the effect of, among other things, raising prices to consumers and potentially eliciting 
reciprocal tariffs, which could slow the global economy, and the removal of tariffs may or may 
not yield the intended results. 
In this scenario, according to the Bank of Spain report "Macroeconomic Projections of the 
Spanish Economy - March 2025”, in recent months, global economic activity has been 
unfolding amid growing uncertainty and geopolitical complexity. Most indices measuring 
international economic policy uncertainty and geopolitical and trade tensions have surged in 
recent months. This deterioration is largely associated with the various measures announced 
by the new administration in the United States (primarily concerning tariffs), the doubts about 
their possible macroeconomic and financial impact and the potential reactions from the 
authorities of other major world regions, like China and the European Union (EU). 
Whilst as of the date of this Prospectus it is not possible to foresee the full impact of the 
above factors in the global, national or local economy, and consequently the effects they may 
have on the Fund and the Notes, the economic conditions may affect in particular (i) the 
ability of Borrowers to make full and timely payments of principal and/or interests under the 
Loans; (ii) the cashflows from the Receivables in the event of moratoriums or relief measures 
whether imposed by the competent government authorities, applicable legislation, adopted 
at industry level or otherwise affecting payments to be made by the Borrowers under the 
Loans (see “Enforcement Risk” below in section 1.1.7); (iii) the market value of the Notes, 
considering the current scenario of interest rates, which has resulted in an increase in market 
interest risks and which could lead to a fall in the price of the Notes if the Noteholders decide 
to sell the Notes before redemption; and (iv) third parties ability to perform their obligations 
under the Transaction Documents to which they are a party (including any failure to perform 
arising from circumstances beyond their control). 
1.1.3. 
RISK OF PREPAYMENT OF THE RECEIVABLES 
Several calculations, such as the average yield, duration and final maturity of the Notes in 
each Class contained in section 4.10 of the Securities Note are subject to a number of 
hypotheses including, inter alia, estimates of prepayment rates that may not be fulfilled. 
Prepayments on the Loans may occur as a consequence of (i) early prepayment of the Loan 
by the relevant Borrower, in the terms set out in the relevant Loan agreement from which 
the Receivables arise; or (ii) early prepayment of the Loan by the relevant Borrower due to 
the fact that the Seller has granted a new loan which cancels the Loan assigned to the Fund. 
Upon termination of the Revolving Period, this prepayment risk shall pass quarterly on each 
Payment Date onto the Noteholders by the partial redemption of the Notes, to the extent 
applicable in accordance with the provisions of section 4.9.2. of the Securities Note. 
The prepayment rate of the Loans cannot be predicted and is influenced by a wide variety of 
economic and other factors, including prevailing interest rates, household income, the 
availability of alternative financing and local and regional economic conditions. For illustrative 
purposes, the average prepayment rates of the Seller’s portfolio of equivalent loans pooled 
in the securitisation funds “SANTANDER CONSUMO 4, FONDO DE TITULIZACIÓN”, “SANTANDER 
CONSUMO 5, FONDO DE TITULIZACIÓN” and “SANTANDER CONSUMO 6, FONDO DE TITULIZACIÓN” are 
19.9%, 13.21% and 16.81%, respectively. 
Prepayment of the Receivables in rates higher than expected will cause the Fund to make 
payments of principal on the Notes earlier than expected and will shorten the maturity of the 
Notes. If principal is paid on the Notes earlier than expected due to prepayments on the 
Receivables (such prepayments occurring at a time when interest rates are lower than interest 
rates that would otherwise be applied if such prepayments had not been made or made at a 
different time), Noteholders may not be able to reinvest the principal in a comparable security 
with an effective interest rate equivalent to the interest rate on the Notes. Similarly, if 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 - Risk Factors 
Page 17 
principal payments on the Notes are made later than expected due to slower than expected 
prepayments or payments on the Receivables, Noteholders may lose reinvestment 
opportunities. Noteholders will bear all reinvestment risk resulting from receiving payments 
of principal on the Notes earlier or later than expected. 
1.1.4. 
RISK OF CONCENTRATION ON THE LOANS’ ORIGINATION YEARS 
As detailed in section 2.2.2.2(iv) of the Additional Information, the largest concentration 
according to the year of origination of the Preliminary Portfolio from which Loans will be 
assigned to the Fund are, as a percentage of the Outstanding Balance of the Receivables, 
year 2022 (11.65%%) and year 2024 (57.60%), altogether representing 69.25%. 
Considering such high concentration in the origination in 2022 and 2024, it can be assumed 
that the delinquency rate of the Preliminary Portfolio has not yet reached its maximum value, 
so it is possible that in the coming months the delinquency rate of the Receivables may 
increase, which would reduce the Available Funds and therefore could affect the payment of 
interest and principal on the Notes. 
1.1.5. 
INTEREST RATE RISK 
The assets of the Fund will be made up of the Receivables representing the economic rights 
in the Loans selected from among those comprising the Preliminary Portfolio. In this regard, 
100% of the Receivables comprising the Preliminary Portfolio have a fixed interest rate.  
On the other hand, the liabilities of the Fund will consist mainly of the Notes, which will accrue 
an annual nominal floating interest. 
Based on the above, the Receivables pooled in the Fund include and will include interest 
payments calculated at interest rates and periods, which are different from the interest rates 
and periods applicable to the interest due under in respect of the Notes.  
For illustrative purposes, the weighted average interest rate of (i) the Notes is 3.24% 
(assuming a 3-month EURIBOR rate of 2.143% on 13 May 2025); and (ii) the Receivables is 
6.70%, as described in table (iii) of section 2.2.2.2 (Receivables) of the Additional 
Information. 
In light of the above, the Fund expects to meet its payment obligations under the Notes 
primarily with the payments relating to the collections from the Receivables. However, the 
interest component of such collections may have no correlation to the floating rate applicable 
to the Notes from time to time.  
In order to protect the Fund from a situation where EURIBOR increases to such an extent that 
the collections are not sufficient to cover the Fund’s obligations under the Notes, the Fund 
will enter into an interest rate swap agreement (the “Interest Rate Swap Agreement”) 
with BANCO SANTANDER, S.A. (the “Swap Counterparty”), which shall at all times be (or its 
credit support provider shall at all times be) an institution rated in accordance with the 
provisions of the Interest Rate Swap Agreement, to hedge the Notes against potential future 
increase of EURIBOR 3-month above the interest rate applicable under the fixed Loans.  
Accordingly, the Fund may in certain circumstances depend upon payments made by the 
Swap Counterparty in order to have sufficient Available Funds to make payments of interest 
on the Notes. Failure by the Swap Counterparty to pay any amounts when due under the 
Interest Rate Swap Agreement will constitute a default thereunder and the Fund will be 
exposed to interest rate risk in the event of any potential increase of EURIBOR 3-month. 
Therefore, unless one or more comparable interest rate swap agreements are entered into 
by the Fund, the Available Funds may be insufficient to make the payments of interest on the 
Notes and the Noteholders may experience delays and/or reductions in the payments of 
interest due to them. 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 - Risk Factors 
Page 18 
In the event of early termination of the Interest Rate Swap Agreement, including any 
termination upon failure by the Swap Counterparty to perform its obligations, the Fund will 
endeavour but cannot guarantee to find a replacement Swap Counterparty. In such case, 
there is no assurance that the Fund will be able to meet its payment obligations under the 
Notes in full or even in part. 
If the Interest Rate Swap Agreement is early terminated, then the Fund may be obliged to 
pay the amount determined as described in section 3.4.8.1 of the Additional Information 
(pursuant to Section 6(e) of the ISDA Master Agreement of the Interest Rate Swap 
Agreement) to the Swap Counterparty which may be based on the actual cost or market 
quotations provided by reference entities of the market of the cost of entering into an interest 
rate swap agreement similar to the Interest Rate Swap Agreement and the unpaid amounts 
on or prior to the early termination date. Except in certain circumstances (i.e., if the Swap 
Counterparty is a ‘Defaulting Party’), any termination payment due to the Swap Counterparty 
by the Fund will rank in priority to payments due on the Notes. Any additional amounts 
required to be paid by the Fund as a result of the early termination of the Interest Rate Swap 
Agreement (including any extra costs incurred if the Fund cannot immediately enter into one 
or more, as appropriate, replacement interest rate swap agreements), may also rank in 
priority to payments due on the Notes. Therefore, this may reduce the Available Funds to 
meet the payment obligations of the Fund (including principal and/or interest under the 
Notes). 
1.1.6. 
GEOGRAPHICAL CONCENTRATION RISK 
As per the table (xi) of section 2.2.2.2 of the Additional Information, the Spanish Autonomous 
Communities (Comunidades Autónomas) having the largest concentrations of Borrowers of 
the Loans from which the Receivables selected to be assigned to the Fund arise are, as a 
percentage of the Outstanding Balance of the Receivables, as follows: Madrid (18.52%), 
Andalucía (17.94%), Cataluña (11.41%) and Galicia (7.95%), altogether representing 
55.82% of the Outstanding Balance.
To the extent that these Autonomous Communities experience a deterioration of their 
respective regional economic conditions in the future, particularly in comparison to other 
regions in Spain, a concentration of the Loans in such regions may exacerbate the risks 
relating to the Loans and, in particular, the risk of Borrowers’ default on their payment 
obligations under the Loans. In addition, any downturn in the local economy of these 
Autonomous Communities may adversely affect the employment levels and, consequently, 
the repayment ability of the Borrowers located in these Autonomous Communities. 
1.1.7. 
ENFORCEMENT RISK 
Given that all Loan agreements have been formalised as private documents, the court 
proceeding available to the Servicer in case of Borrower’s default under the Loan agreement 
consists in the Servicer commencing declarative proceedings (acción declarativa) for the 
recognition of the amounts that are due and payable under the Loan agreement in order to 
subsequently be able to commence enforcement action (acción ejecutiva) of the potential 
ruling against the assets of the Borrower. 
If the Loan agreements had been documented as notarial deed (póliza), the enforcement 
proceeding would foreseeably be quicker than the court proceeding for private documents, 
as the former provides for direct enforcement (see further information on enforcement timing 
in section 2.2.7 of the Additional Information). In this regard, a delay in the recovery 
procedures of the Loans formalised as private contracts as opposed to the loans formalised 
as notarial deeds (pólizas) could entail a temporary reduction and/or postponement of cash 
flows under the Loans and, ultimately, the Issuer’s ability to make payments under the Notes, 
without it being possible to know in advance the timing of such procedures. 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 - Risk Factors 
Page 19 
In addition, the council of ministers has sanctioned a draft bill concerning credit 
administrators and purchasers, proposing amendments to certain regulations related to loans 
granted to consumers in Spain (Proyecto de Ley de administradores y compradores de 
créditos y por la que se modifican la Ley de Medidas de Reforma del Sistema Financiero, la 
Ley de contratos de crédito al consumo, la Ley de ordenación, supervisión y solvencia de 
entidades de crédito, la Ley reguladora de los contratos de crédito inmobiliario, y el texto 
refundido de la Ley Concursal) (the "Draft Bill"). The Draft Bill's second final provision 
mandates regulatory changes in the Law 16/2011, which regulates consumer credit 
agreements, including the matters described as follows: (i) lenders must implement debt 
renegotiation policies ratified by the highest governing body for all debtor categories, 
encompassing measures such as extension of maturity dates, deferral of payment, reduction 
of interest rates, grace periods, partial repayment, currency conversion, partial forgiveness, 
and debt consolidation, aimed at facilitating reasonable renegotiation agreements before 
demanding full repayment or initiating judicial proceedings, without specifying mandatory 
minimum standards; (ii) economically vulnerable borrowers must be offered a payment plan, 
before the sale or assignment of the matured loan to a third party, under which the accrual 
of new interest and fees on the loan is frozen, the debt is repaid in a manner consistent with 
the borrower’s financial circumstances, with monthly instalments not exceeding five per cent 
of their monthly income at the time the offer is made, and a predefined debt reduction scheme 
is applied; (iii) obligations arising from customer protection and transparency regulations, 
shall be fully transferred to the third-party assignee, and the codes of good practice adhered 
to by the assignor shall remain applicable; (iv) specific pre-contractual information obligations 
concerning the modification of credit agreement terms are mandated; and (v) certain 
conditions governing the imposition of default charges or early maturity fees on customers 
are included. This Draft Bill will undergo the parliamentary process, where it can be approved 
(with or without modifications to the above) or not passed. Should the above provisions be 
approved, they could entail a temporary reduction and/or postponement of cash flows under 
the Loans and, ultimately, the Issuer’s ability to make payments under the Notes or a material 
adverse impact. 
1.2. 
Related to the nature of the securities 
1.2.1. 
SUBORDINATION RISK 
As described in section 4.6.3 of the Securities Note, during the Pro-Rata Redemption Period, 
the ordinary redemption of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class 
D Notes and the Class E Notes will be pari passu and pro-rata without preference or priority 
amongst themselves in accordance with the Pre-Enforcement Priority of Payments set forth 
in section 3.4.7.2 of the Additional Information in an amount equal to the Pro-Rata 
Redemption Amount. 
Furthermore, as described in section 4.6.3 of the Securities Note, upon the occurrence of a 
Subordination Event (other than a Seller´s Call Option), during the Sequential Redemption 
Period, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes and the 
Class E Notes will be redeemed sequentially in accordance with the Pre-Enforcement Priority 
of Payments set forth in section 3.4.7.2 of the Additional Information. 
Conversely, the Class F Notes will redeem from the First Payment Date with the available 
excess spread for an amount equal to Class F Notes Target Amortisation Amount in 
accordance with the Pre-Enforcement Priority of Payments set forth in section 3.4.7.2 of the 
Additional Information.  
As a result, upon the occurrence of a Subordination Event (which comprises, among others

Class A Notes: will rank pari passu and pro rata without preference or priority 
amongst themselves and in priority to the Class B Notes, Class C Notes, Class D Notes, 
Class E Notes and Class F Notes and shall benefit from 17.00% of subordination of 
Class B Notes, Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes and Class F Notes, as the 
case may be. 
 
Class B Notes: will rank pari passu and pro rata without preference or priority 
amongst themselves and in priority to the Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E 
Notes and Class F Notes and shall benefit from 13.50% of subordination of Class C 
Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes and Class F Notes, as the case may be.  
 
Class C Notes: will rank pari passu and pro rata without preference or priority 
amongst themselves and in priority to the Class D Notes, Class E Notes and Class 
F Notes and shall benefit from 9.50% of subordination of Class D Notes, Class E 
Notes and Class F Notes, as the case may be. 
 
Class D Notes: will rank pari passu and pro rata without preference or priority 
amongst themselves and in priority to the Class E Notes and Class F Notes and 
shall benefit from 5.25% of subordination of Class E Notes and Class F Notes, as 
the case may be. 
 
Class E Notes: will rank pari passu and pro rata without preference or priority 
amongst themselves and in priority to the Class F Notes and shall benefit from 
1.50% of subordination of Class F Notes, as the case may be. 
 
Class F Notes: will rank pari passu and pro rata without preference or priority 
amongst themselves and shall not benefit from the subordination of any other class 
of Notes, as the case may be. The proceeds of this Class of Notes are not used to 
purchase Receivables, but to fund the Reserve Fund up to an amount equal to the 
Initial Reserve Fund. 
As a result of the sequential redemption of the Notes, junior ranking Classes of Notes will be 
subordinated to more senior Classes of Notes, thereby ensuring that Available Funds are 
applied to more senior Classes of Notes in priority to more junior Classes of Notes. The 
existence of such subordination entails a greater exposure of junior Classes of Notes (the 
more junior, the greater exposure) to higher volatility, interruption of payments, and 
ultimately a potential sustainment of losses, in comparison to senior Classes of Notes. There 
is no certainty that these subordination rules shall protect any Class of Notes from the risk of 
loss. The materiality of this risk is further developed in section 3.4.7 of the Additional 
Information. 
1.2.2. 
NOTES EUROELIGIBILITY RISK 
Class A Notes are intended to be held in a manner which will allow them to be recognised as 
eligible collateral for Eurosystem monetary policy and Intraday credit operations by the 
Eurosystem (“Eurosystem Eligible Collateral”). This means that the Class A Notes are 
intended to be deposited with SOCIEDAD DE GESTION DE LOS SISTEMAS DE REGISTRO, COMPENSACIÓN 
Y LIQUIDACIÓN DE VALORES S.A.U. (“IBERCLEAR”) but does not necessarily mean that the Class 
A Notes shall be recognised as Eurosystem Eligible Collateral either upon issue or at any time 
during their life. Such recognition will, inter alia, depend upon satisfaction of the Eurosystem 
eligibility criteria set out in the Guideline of the ECB of 19 December 2014 on the 
implementation of the Eurosystem monetary policy framework (ECB/2014/60) (recast) as 
amended and applicable from time to time (the “Guideline”), including compliance with loan-
by-loan reporting in a prescribed format and manner. 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 - Risk Factors 
Page 21 
If the Class A Notes do not satisfy the criteria specified by the ECB, or if the Servicer fails to 
submit the required loan-level data, the Class A Notes will not be eligible for being Eurosystem 
Eligible Collateral. 
Neither the Fund, the Management Company, the Seller, the Joint Lead Managers or the 
Arranger give any representations, warranty, confirmation or guarantee to any potential 
investor that the Class A Notes will, either upon issue, or at any time during their life, satisfy 
any or all requirements for Eurosystem eligibility and be recognised as Eurosystem Eligible 
Collateral for any reason whatever. Any potential investor in the Class A Notes should reach 
its own conclusions and seek its own advice with respect to whether or not the Class A Notes 
constitute or may in the future cease to constitute Eurosystem Eligible Collateral.  
1.2.3. 
YIELD AND DURATION RISK 
Several calculations, such as the average yield, duration and final maturity of the Notes in 
each Class (assuming a constant prepayment rate (CPR) of 12%, 15% and 18% - which is 
consistent with the historical information provided by the Seller as per the tables shown in 
section 2.2.7.3 of the Additional Information) contained in section 4.10 of the Securities Note 
are subject to a number of hypothesis, inter alia, estimates of prepayment rates and 
delinquency rates that may not be fulfilled.  
These calculations are influenced by a number of economic and social factors such as the 
macroeconomic instability described in Risk Factor 1.1.2 (Risk resulting from the 
macroeconomic, geopolitical and climate conditions), market interest rates, the Borrowers’ 
financial circumstances and the general level of economic activity, preventing their 
predictability. 
No guarantee can be given as to the level of prepayments (in part or in full) that the 
Receivables may experience. Early repayment of the Receivables in rates higher than 
expected will cause the Issuer to make payments of principal on the Notes earlier than 
expected and will shorten the maturity of such Notes. 
1.2.4. 
EARLY REDEMPTION OF THE NOTES  
The Management Company shall proceed to carry out the early liquidation of the Fund (the 
“Early Liquidation of the Fund”) and, hence, the early redemption of the whole (but not 
part) of the Notes (the “Early Redemption of the Notes”) in three categories of events in 
accordance with the Post-Enforcement Priority of Payments as set out in section 3.4.7.3 of 
the Additional Information (the “Enforcement Events”): 
 
the occurrence of any Issuer Event of Default, described in section 4.4.3.1 of the 
Registration Document and summarized below;  
 
the occurrence of any of the mandatory early liquidation events described in section 
4.4.3.2 of the Registration Document; or 
 
the exercise by the Seller of any of the Seller´s Call Options described in section 4.4.3.3 
of the Registration Document and summarized below. 
The Seller may exercise any of the Seller’s Call Options, upon the occurrence of any of a 
Clean-Up Call Event; a Regulatory Change Event; or a Tax Change Event; and instruct the 
Management Company to carry out the Early Liquidation of the Fund and the Early 
Redemption of the Notes in whole (but not in part), in accordance with section 4.4.3.3 of the 
Registration Document.  
For the purposes of the above, each of the Seller’s Call Options are defined as follows: 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 - Risk Factors 
Page 22 
 
a “Clean-Up Call Event” means any event on which at any time, the aggregate 
Outstanding Balance of the Receivables, falling below 10% of the aggregate 
Outstanding Balance thereof on the Date of Incorporation. 
 
a “Regulatory Change Event” means (a) any enactment or implementation of, or 
supplement or amendment to, or change in any applicable law, policy, rule, guideline 
or regulation of any competent international, European or national body (including the 
European Central Bank, the Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”) or any other 
competent international, European or national regulatory or supervisory authority) or 
the application or official interpretation of, or view expressed by any such competent 
body with respect to, any such law, regulation, rule, policy or guideline; or (b) a 
notification by or other communication from an applicable regulatory or supervisory 
authority is received by the Seller with respect to the transactions contemplated by 
the Transaction Documents; which, in either case, occurs on or after the Date of 
Incorporation and results in, or would in the reasonable opinion of the Seller result in, 
a material adverse change in the rate of return on capital of the Fund and/or the Seller 
or materially increasing the cost or materially reducing the benefit for the Seller of the 
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents. 
 
a “Tax Change Event” means any event after the Date of Incorporation derived from 
changes in relevant taxation law and accounting provisions and/or regulation (or 
official interpretation of that taxation law and accounting provisions and/or regulation 
by authorities) as a consequence of which the Fund is or becomes at any time required 
by law to deduct or withhold, in respect of any payment under any of the Notes, any 
present or future taxes, levies or governmental charges, regardless of their nature, 
which are imposed under any applicable legal system or in any country with competent 
jurisdiction, or for the account of, any political subdivision thereof or government 
agency authorised to levy taxes, that materially affects the allocation of benefits among 
the parties of the transaction. 
Upon exercise of any of the Seller’s Call Options, the Seller shall repurchase all outstanding 
Receivables at the Repurchase Value calculated in accordance with section 4.4.3.2 of the 
Registration Document.  
Any of the Seller’s Call Options can only be exercised by the Seller to the extent that the 
Repurchase Value together with the rest of Available Funds considering the Post-Enforcement 
Priority of Payments contemplated in section 3.4.7.3 of the Additional Information are 
sufficient to redeem Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes 
and the Class E Notes in whole at par together with all accrued but unpaid interest thereon. 
Consequently, any potential investor in the Class F Notes should be aware that the exercise 
of any of the Seller’s Call Options may result in the Principal Amount Outstanding of Class F 
Notes not being totally or partially redeemed.  
If the Notes are redeemed earlier than expected due to the exercise by the Seller of any of 
the Seller’s Call Options (such early redemption occurring at a time when interest rates are 
lower than interest rates that would otherwise be applied if such early redemption had not 
been made or made at a different time), Noteholders may not be able to reinvest the principal 
in a comparable security with an effective interest rate equivalent to the interest rate on the 
Notes. Noteholders will bear all reinvestment risk resulting from early redemption of the Notes 
earlier than expected. 
No assurance is provided that, upon the occurrence of a Clean-Up Call Event, a Regulatory 
Change Event or a Tax Change Event entitling the Seller to exercise any of the Seller’s Call 
Options, the Seller will exercise the right to instruct the Management Company to carry out 
the Early Liquidation of the Fund and the Early Redemption of the Notes.  


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 - Risk Factors 
Page 23 
In addition to the above, if the Issuer defaults in the payment of any interest due and payable 
in respect of the Most Senior Class of Notes (unless, where the Class F Notes is the Most 
Senior Class of Notes) and such default continues for a period of at least five (5) Business 
Days the Management Company will declare the occurrence of an Issuer Event of Default (an 
“Issuer Event of Default”). Unless Noteholders representing at least seventy-five (75) per 
cent. of the Principal Amount Outstanding of the Most Senior Class of Notes have instructed 
the Management Company in writing not to carry out the Early Liquidation of the Fund in 
accordance with the procedure set forth in section 4.4.3.1 of the Registration Document, the 
Management Company shall carry out: 
 
the Early Liquidation of the Fund in accordance with section 4.4.3.1 of the Registration 
Document mutatis mutandis; and 
 
the Early Redemption of the Notes, in accordance with the Post-Enforcement Priority 
of Payments set forth in section 3.4.7.3 of the Additional Information.  
Where the Noteholders representing at least seventy-five (75) per cent. of the Principal 
Amount Outstanding of the Most Senior Class of Notes have instructed the Management 
Company in writing not to carry out the Early Liquidation of the Fund, but the Issuer Event of 
Default is continuing, the Noteholders representing at least seventy-five (75) per cent. of the 
Principal Amount Outstanding of the Most Senior Class of Notes may subsequently instruct 
the Management Company to carry out the Early Liquidation of the Fund at any time. 
Any potential investor in the Notes should be aware that:  
 
the occurrence of an Issuer Event of Default may result in the Principal Amount 
Outstanding of the Notes, not being redeemed in full; and 
 
all Classes of Notes (including Class F Notes) are subject to the decision taken by the 
Most Senior Class of Notes at any moment after the occurrence of an Issuer Event of 
Default with regard to the Early Liquidation of the Fund and the Early Redemption of 
the Notes, as indicated above.  
 
Class F Notes shall not be considered the Most Senior Class of Notes in any case for 
these purposes. 
Likewise, if the Notes are redeemed earlier than expected due to the exercise by the 
Management Company of the early redemption of such Notes (such early redemption 
occurring at a time when interest rates are lower than interest rates that would otherwise be 
applied if such early redemption had not been made or made at a different time), Noteholders 
may not be able to reinvest the principal in a comparable security with an effective interest 
rate equivalent to the interest rate on the Notes. Noteholders will bear all reinvestment risk 
resulting from redemption of the Notes earlier than expected. 
1.2.5. 
RISK RELATING TO BENCHMARKS AND THE INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENT 
The interest payable on the Notes and the payments to be made in respect of the Interest 
Rate Swap Agreement are determined by reference to Euro Interbank Offered Rate 
(“EURIBOR”), the calculation and determination of which is subject from 1 January 2018 to 
Regulation (EU) No. 2016/1011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2016 
on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure 
the performance of investment funds (as amended from time to time, the “Benchmark 
Regulation”) published in the Official Journal of the EU on 29 June 2016, which entered into 
force on 30 June 2016 and is applied from 1 January 2018.  
The Benchmark Regulation applies to “contributors”, “administrators” and “users of” 
benchmarks in the EU, and, among other things, (i) requires benchmark administrators to be 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 - Risk Factors 
Page 24 
authorised (or, if non-EU-based, to be subject to an equivalent regulatory regime) and to 
comply with extensive requirements in relation to the administration of “benchmarks” and (ii) 
ban the use of benchmarks of unauthorised administrators. 
Separately, the working group on euro risk free-rates for the euro area published a set of 
guiding principles and high-level recommendations for fall-back provisions in, amongst other 
things, new euro denominated cash products (including asset-backed securities) referencing 
EURIBOR. The guiding principles indicate, among others, that continuing to reference 
EURIBOR in relevant contracts (without robust fall-back provisions) may increase the risk to 
the euro area financial system. On 11 May 2021, the working group on euro risk-free rates 
first published its recommendations on EURIBOR fall-back trigger events and fall-back rates. 
investors should be aware that the market is continuing to develop such alternative reference 
rates and further changes or recommendations may be introduced. 
Although EURIBOR has been reformed in order to comply with the terms of the Benchmark 
Regulation, it is not possible to ascertain as at the date of this Prospectus how such changes 
may impact the determination of EURIBOR for the purposes of the Notes and the Interest 
Rate Swap Agreement, whether this will result in an increase or decrease in EURIBOR rates 
or whether such changes will have an adverse impact on the liquidity or the market value of 
the Notes.  
Ongoing international and/or national reform initiatives and the increased regulatory scrutiny 
of benchmarks generally could increase the costs and risks of administering or otherwise 
participating in the setting of a benchmark and complying with any applicable regulations or 
requirements. Such factors may discourage market participants from continuing to administer 
or contribute to benchmarks, trigger changes in the rules or methodologies used in respect 
of benchmarks, and/or lead to the disappearance of benchmarks. 
As provided in section 4.8.5 of the Securities Note, changes in the manner of administration 
of EURIBOR could result in the base rate on the Notes changing from EURIBOR to an 
Alternative Base Rate under certain circumstances (broadly related to EURIBOR dysfunction 
or discontinuation). This Alternative Base Rate, subject to certain conditions being satisfied 
will be implemented in substitution of EURIBOR or the then current Reference Rate, as the 
new Reference Rate applicable of the Notes, unless that Noteholders representing at least 10 
per cent. of the Principal Amount Outstanding of the Most Senior Class of Notes do not consent 
to the Base Rate Modification. If such circumstance arises, then the proposed Base Rate 
Modification will not be implemented and therefore, the Reference Rate applicable to the 
Notes will be equal to the last Reference Rate available on the relevant applicable screen rate 
pursuant to paragraph (h) of section 4.8.5 of the Securities Notes. 
Any of the above changes could have a material adverse effect on the value of and return on 
the Notes and shall apply to the Interest Rate Swap Agreement for the purpose of aligning 
the base rate of the Interest Rate Swap Agreement to the Reference Rate of the Notes 
following these changes unless the Swap Counterparty decides not to accept the Alternative 
Base Rate, and the Fund or the Swap Counterparty decides to early terminate the Interest 
Rate Swap Agreement as a consequence of a Base Rate Modification in accordance with the 
Interest Rate Swap Agreement, as provided in paragraph (f) of section 3.4.8.1 (Early 
Termination) of the Additional Information. 
For further information on the potential consequences arising from an early termination of 
the Interest Rate Swap Agreement, please refer to Risk Factor 1.1.4 (Interest Rate Risk) 
above. 
If the Swap Counterparty decides not to accept the Alternative Base Rate and neither the 
Fund nor the Swap Counterparty decides to early terminate the Interest Rate Swap 
Agreement based on the additional termination event described in paragraph (f) of section 
3.4.8.1 (Early Termination) of the Additional Information, the Reference Rate applicable to 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 - Risk Factors 
Page 25 
the Notes shall be different to the floating rate applicable under the Interest Rate Swap 
Agreement, and taking into consideration that the Fund may in certain circumstances depend 
upon payments made by the Swap Counterparty in order to have sufficient Available Funds 
to make payments of interest on the Notes, the Available Funds may be insufficient and the 
Noteholders may experience delays and/or reductions in the payments of interest due to 
them. 
If the Swap Counterparty decides to accept the Base Rate Modification, the Fund may agree 
to pay certain amount to the Swap Counterparty as a consequence of a change in the mark-
to-market value of the Interest Rate Swap Agreement or a change in the amount due to the 
Swap Counterparty, which shall rank in priority to payments due on the Notes. 
Prospective Noteholders should consult their own independent advisers and make their own 
assessment about the potential risks imposed by the Benchmark Regulation reforms in 
making any investment decision with respect to any Notes referencing a “benchmark”. 
The above-mentioned procedure to change the EURIBOR as set forth in section 4.8.5 of the 
Securities Note does not apply to the interest accrued on the Start-Up Expenses Loan 
Agreement as set forth in section 3.4.4.1 of the Additional Information. 
1.2.6. 
REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS UNDER BASEL III FRAMEWORK 
Investors that are subject to prudential requirements shall consider the last amendments 
(from December 2017) to the regulatory capital framework published in 2010 by the Basel 
Committee on Banking Supervision (the “Basel III Framework”) and, more specifically, to 
the securitisation framework from 11 December 2014 (as revised in July 2016). Among 
others, Basel III Framework includes a requirement to apply a so-called “output floor”. 
According to such amendments to the Basel III Framework, for securitisation positions the 
required risk weighting is the higher of (i) risk weights calculated using internally-modelled 
approaches for which the bank has supervisory approval and (ii) 72.5% of the output of risk 
weights calculated in accordance with (a) the external ratings-based approach (SEC-ERBA), 
(b) the standardised approach (SEC-SA) or (c) a risk weight of 1250%. On 27 March 2020, a 
number of measures were endorsed. Among such measures, the implementation date of the 
revised market risk framework was deferred by one year to 1 January 2023, based on a 
phased-in arrangement running from 1 January 2023 up to and including 1 January 2028. 
The output floor may increase capital requirements of those Investors that are subject to 
prudential requirement and therefore reduce expected return on the Notes. Consequently, 
prospective investors should consult their own advisers as to the consequences of the 
implementation in their own jurisdictions of the above.

RISKS DERIVED FROM THE ISSUER’S LEGAL NATURE AND OPERATIONS 
2.1. 
Related to the Issuer’s nature, financial situation or activity 
2.1.1. 
MANDATORY REPLACEMENT OF THE MANAGEMENT COMPANY 
If the Management Company is declared insolvent or its authorisation to operate as a 
management company of securitisation funds is revoked, notwithstanding with the effects of 
such insolvency as described under section 3.7.2.3 of the Additional Information, it shall find 
a substitute management company.  
If four months have elapsed from the occurrence of the event triggering the substitution of 
the Management Company and no new management company has been found willing to take 
over management of the Fund and has been appointed, the Fund shall be liquidated and the 
Notes may be subject to early redemption in accordance with section 4.4.3.2 of the 
Registration Document. 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 - Risk Factors 
Page 26 
2.1.2. 
LIMITATION OF ACTIONS 
The Fund (devoid of legal personality) shall only bear liability to its obligations with its assets. 
Noteholders and other creditors of the Fund shall have no recourse whatsoever against 
Borrowers who have defaulted on their payment obligations under the Loans, or against the 
Seller. Any such rights shall lie with the Management Company, representing the Fund. 
Noteholders and all other creditors of the Fund shall have no recourse whatsoever against 
the Management Company other than in case of breach by the Management Company of its 
obligations or failure to comply with the provisions of this Prospectus, the Deed of 
Incorporation, the rest of Transaction Documents, and the applicable laws and regulations. 
Those actions shall be resolved in the relevant ordinary declaratory proceedings depending 
on the amount claimed.  
In particular, Noteholders (and all other creditors of the Fund) shall have no recourse 
whatsoever against the Fund or against the Management Company in the following scenarios: 
 
in the event of payment default of amounts due by the Fund resulting from the 
existence of Receivable default or prepayment; 
 
breach by the Seller or the counterparties of their obligations under the corresponding 
Transaction Documents entered into by the Management Company for and on behalf 
of the Fund; or 
 
shortfall of the credit enhancements to cover payment of the Notes. 
2.1.3. 
INEXISTENCE OF MEETING OF CREDITORS 
Article 21(10) of EU Securitisation Regulation provides that transaction documentation shall 
include clear provisions that facilitate the timely resolution of conflicts between different 
classes of investors.  
Whilst the Deed of Incorporation does not contemplate Noteholders having voting rights or 
the ability to call creditors’ meetings in the terms of article 37 of Law 5/2015 of 27 April on 
the Promotion of Enterprise Funding (Ley 5/2015, de 27 de abril, de fomento de la financiación 
empresarial) (as amended from time to time, “Law 5/2015”), pursuant to article 26.1.a) 
the Management Company, as legal representative of the Fund, is legally required to protect 
the interest of the Noteholders and other creditors of the Fund as if handling its own interests, 
caring for the levels of diligence, reporting and defence of the interests of the former and 
avoiding situations involving conflicts of interest, and giving priority to the interests of the 
Noteholders and the other creditors of the Fund over its own and to ensure that the Fund is 
operated in accordance with the provisions of the Deed of Incorporation. Under Law 5/2015 
and general principles of Spanish Law, in case of conflict between different classes of 
Noteholders, the Management Company, where appropriate, will decide on the relevant issue 
to ensure timely resolution of such conflict. The Management Company is not responsible for 
any of the Fund’s liabilities, but in accordance with article 26.2 of Law 5/2015, the 
Management Company shall be liable to the Noteholders and other creditors of the Fund for 
all losses caused to them by a breach of (i) its duties and (ii) the provisions of the Deed of 
Incorporation, the rest of the Transaction Documents and the applicable laws and regulations 
(those duties including, among others, exercising and enforcing all of rights and remedies of 
the Fund under the Transaction Documents to which the Fund is a party). It will be liable for 
the penalties applicable thereto pursuant to the provisions of Law 5/2015. 
Under article 26 of Law 5/2015 the Management Company shall act with maximum due 
diligence and transparency in the defence of the interests of the Noteholders and the other 
creditors. Pursuant to article 26.1.f) of Law 5/2015 the Management Company has in place 
procedural and organisational measures to prevent potential conflicts of interests ensuring a 
timely resolution of any conflict of interest that may arise taking into account its nature and 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 - Risk Factors 
Page 27 
potential consequences. Under Spanish Law, the Management Company would generally be 
required to give preference to the holders of the more senior Class of Notes. 
2.2. 
Related to legal and regulatory risks 
2.2.1. 
EU SECURITISATION REGULATION: SIMPLE, TRANSPARENT AND STANDARDISED SECURITISATION 
The transaction envisaged under this Prospectus is intended to qualify as a simple, 
transparent and standardised securitisation (STS)-securitisation within the meaning of article 
18 of the EU Securitisation Regulation. Consequently, the Seller will submit, on or about the 
Date of Incorporation (and in any case within fifteen (15) calendar days from the Date of 
Incorporation), a STS notification to ESMA (the “STS Notification”), pursuant to which 
compliance with the requirements of articles 19 to 22 of the EU Securitisation Regulation shall 
be notified to ESMA in order to request that the securitisation transaction described in this 
Prospectus is included in the relevant ESMA register within the meaning of article 27(5) of 
the EU Securitisation Regulation. The Management Company shall notify the Bank of Spain 
(as competent authority) of the submission of such mandatory STS Notification from the 
Seller to ESMA, and attaching such notification. 
For these purposes, the Seller has appointed PRIME COLLATERALISED SECURITIES (PCS) EU SAS 
(“PCS”), as a verification agent authorised under article 28 of the EU Securitisation 
Regulation, in connection with an assessment of the compliance with the requirements of 
articles 19 to 22 of the EU Securitisation Regulation (the “STS Verification”). It is important 
to note that the involvement of PCS as an authorised verification agent is not mandatory and 
the responsibility for compliance with the EU Securitisation Regulation remains with the 
relevant institutional investors, originators and issuers, as applicable in each case. The STS 
Verification will not absolve such entities from making their own assessments with respect to 
the EU Securitisation Regulation, and the STS Verification cannot be relied on to determine 
compliance with the foregoing regulations in the absence of such assessments by the relevant 
entities.  
The 
STS 
verification 
shall 
be 
available 
in 
the 
following 
link: 
https://pcsmarket.org/transactions/santander-consumo-8/. 
No assurance can be provided that the securitisation transaction described in this Prospectus 
will receive the STS Verification by PCS (either before issuance or at any time thereafter), 
and if the securitisation transaction described in this Prospectus does not receive the STS 
Verification, this shall not, under any circumstances, affect the liability of the Originator and 
the Fund in respect of their legal obligations under the EU Securitisation Regulation, nor shall 
it affect the obligations imposed on institutional investors as set out in article 5 of the EU 
Securitisation Regulation.  
None of the Issuer, the Reporting Entity, the Arranger or the Joint Lead Managers make any 
representation or accept any liability for (i) the inclusion of the securitisation transaction in 
the ESMA Register of STS notifications list administered by ESMA within the meaning for the 
purposes of article 27 of the EU Securitisation Regulation or (ii) the securitisation transaction 
to qualify as an STS-securitisation under the EU Securitisation Regulation at any point in time. 
Non-compliance with the status of an STS-securitisation may result in higher capital 
requirements for investors, as well as in various administrative sanctions and/or remedial 
measures being imposed on the Fund or the Seller. Any of such administrative sanctions 
and/or remedial measures may affect the ability of the Fund to fulfil its payment obligations 
under the Notes. 
None of the Seller (as originator) or the Fund (as SSPE) under the UK Securitisation 
Framework is actively seeking to comply with the requirements of the UK Securitisation 
Framework. UK investors should be aware of this and should note that their regulatory 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 - Risk Factors 
Page 28 
position may be affected. The transaction will not be a UK STS transaction and will therefore 
not be notified to the UK Financial Conduct Authority for that purpose.

4.4.3. 
EARLY LIQUIDATION OF THE FUND 
The Management Company shall proceed to carry out the early liquidation of the Fund (the 
“Early Liquidation of the Fund”) and, hence, the early redemption of the whole (but not 
part) of the Notes (the “Early Redemption of the Notes”) in three categories of events in 
accordance with the Post-Enforcement Priority of Payments as set out in section 3.4.7.3 of 
the Additional Information (the “Enforcement Events”): 
 
the occurrence of any Issuer Event of Default, described in section 4.4.3.1 below;  
 
the occurrence of any of the mandatory early liquidation events described in section 
4.4.3.2 below; or 
 
the exercise by the Seller of any of the Seller´s Call Options described in section 4.4.3.3 
below. 
4.4.3.1. 
Issuer Event of Default 
If on any Payment Date, the Issuer defaults in the payment of any interest due and payable 
in respect of the Most Senior Class of Notes (unless, where the Class F Notes are the Most 
Senior Class of Notes) and such default continues for a period of at least five (5) Business 
Days, the Management Company will declare the occurrence of an Issuer Event of Default. 
Following the declaration by the Management Company of the occurrence of an Issuer Event 
of Default (unless Noteholders representing at least seventy-five (75) per cent. of the 
Principal Amount Outstanding of the Most Senior Class of Notes at such time have instructed 
the Management Company in writing not to carry out the Early Liquidation of the Fund in 
accordance with the procedure set forth below), the Management Company shall carry out: 
 
the Early Liquidation of the Fund in accordance with section 4.4.5 of the Registration 
Document mutatis mutandis; and 
 
the Early Redemption of the Notes, in accordance with the Post-Enforcement Priority 
of Payments set forth in section 3.4.7.3 of the Additional Information in the Payment 
Date following the occurrence of an Event of Default. 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 - Registration Document for Asset-Backed Securities  
Page 33 
Therefore, upon the occurrence of an Issuer Event of Default, the Management Company, on 
behalf of the Fund, shall take the following actions: 
 
The Management Company shall promptly notify all Noteholders in writing of the 
occurrence of an Issuer Event of Default, by publishing the appropriate insider 
information (información privilegiada) or other relevant information (otra información 
relevante) with CNMV. 
 
Within thirty (30) Business Days from the date of notification to the Noteholders 
through the CNMV, Noteholders representing at least seventy-five (75) per cent of the 
Principal Amount Outstanding of the Most Senior Class of Notes may deliver a written 
notice to the Management Company (or to the Paying Agent in accordance with the 
current practice of any applicable clearing system through which such Most Senior 
Class of Notes may be held) instructing the Management Company not to carry out an 
Early Liquidation of the Fund. Once the deadline is completed: 
(i) 
if Noteholders representing at least seventy-five (75) per cent of the Principal 
Amount Outstanding of the Most Senior Class of Notes have directed the 
Management Company (or the Paying Agent, as set forth above) in writing not 
to carry out the Early Liquidation of the Fund, the Management Company will 
not carry out such Early Liquidation of the Fund. 
(ii) 
If (x) no instructions have been received from the Noteholders of the Most 
Senior Class of Notes or (y) Noteholders directing the Management Company 
(or the Paying Agent, as set forth above) in writing not to carry out the Early 
Liquidation of the Fund do not represent at least seventy-five (75) per cent of 
the Principal Amount Outstanding of the Most Senior Class of Notes, the 
Management Company will carry out the Early Liquidation of the Fund, in 
accordance with the procedure set forth in sections 4.4.3.2 and 4.4.5 of the 
Registration Document below, mutatis mutandis. 
The decision of the Noteholders representing at least ten seventy-five per cent (75%) 
of the Principal Amount Outstanding of the Most Senior Class of Notes will bind holders 
of the Notes as well as other relevant creditors, even if they have not approved such 
decision. 
 
Once the deadline set forth in paragraph (b) above is completed, the Management 
Company shall promptly notify all Noteholders in writing of the instructions received 
from the Noteholders representing at least ten seventy-five per cent (75%) of the 
Principal Amount Outstanding of the Most Senior Class of Notes (if any), by publishing 
the appropriate insider information (información privilegiada) or other relevant 
information (otra información relevante) with CNMV. 
Where at least Noteholders representing seventy-five (75) per cent. of the Principal Amount 
Outstanding of the Most Senior Class of Notes have instructed the Management Company in 
writing not to carry out the Early Liquidation of the Fund but the Issuer Event of Default is 
continuing, at least Noteholders representing seventy-five (75) per cent. of the Principal 
Amount Outstanding of the Most Senior Class of Notes may subsequently instruct the 
Management Company to carry out the Early Liquidation of the Fund at any time. 
Any written instruction delivered to the Management Company (or the Paying Agent, as set 
forth before) by the Noteholders in accordance with the foregoing must be accompanied by 
evidence (reasonably satisfactory to the Management Company or the Paying Agent) of the 
ownership of the relevant amount of Notes by the relevant Noteholders. 
4.4.3.2. 
Mandatory early liquidation of the Fund 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 - Registration Document for Asset-Backed Securities  
Page 34 
The Management Company shall carry out the Early Liquidation of the Fund and, thus, the 
Early Redemption of the Notes in whole (but not part) at any time in any of the following 
instances:  
 
if, as stated in article 33 of Law 5/2015, four (4) months have elapsed since the 
occurrence of an event giving rise to the mandatory replacement of the Management 
Company due to a declaration of insolvency thereof; or 
 
in the event of revocation of the authorisation of the Management Company. 
In either case, without a new management company having been found that is prepared to 
take over management of the Fund and that is appointed pursuant to section 3.7.2 of the 
Additional Information. 
In order for the Management Company to carry out the Early Liquidation of the Fund, and 
therefore, the Early Redemption of the Notes, the Management Company shall sell the 
Receivables and any remaining assets of the Fund in accordance with the provisions below: 
Pre-emptive right of the Seller to acquire the Receivables 
Upon the occurrence of any of the events indicated in paragraphs (a) and (b) above, the 
Seller will have the right, but not the obligation, to repurchase the outstanding Receivables 
at the time of Early Liquidation of the Fund at a price equal to the Repurchase Value. 
“Repurchase Value” means at any time (i) in respect of any Receivable other than a 
Defaulted Receivable, Par Value, and (ii) in respect of a Defaulted Receivable, Par Value less 
any Seller’s provisions allocated with respect to such Receivable matching its book value on 
the Seller’s balance sheet at such time. 
“Par Value” means at any time the Outstanding Balance of the Receivables together with all 
accrued but unpaid interest thereon at such time. 
In order for the Seller to exercise this right, the Management Company shall notify in writing 
to the Seller that the Early Liquidation of the Fund will be carried out immediately and in any 
case within thirty (30) Business Days from the occurrence of any of the events indicated in 
paragraphs (a) and (b) above. 
Upon receiving such notification, the Seller will have a period of five (5) Business Days from 
the date on which it receives such notification to communicate its decision to repurchase or 
not the Receivables at the Repurchase Value. 
If the Seller confirms its decision to repurchase the Receivables, the transfer of the 
Receivables to the Seller must be completed within fifteen (15) Business Days from the date 
on which the Seller communicates such decision. 
For the avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances will the Seller’s pre-emptive right imply 
an obligation or undertaking to repurchase any of the Receivables in the above events. 
Sale of the Receivables to third parties 
In case the Seller decides not to exercise its pre-emptive right to repurchase the Receivables 
in accordance with the provisions of the preceding section, the Management Company shall 
request legally binding bids from at least two (2) entities at its sole discretion among those 
active in the purchase and sale of similar assets. 
The Management Company may obtain any appraisal report it deems necessary from third 
party entities in order to assess the value of the Receivables. 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 - Registration Document for Asset-Backed Securities  
Page 35 
The Management Company shall set forth the terms and conditions of the bidding process 
(including, without limitation, the information to be provided to the bidders and deadline to 
submit the bids) in the manner it considers best to maximise the value of the Receivables. 
The highest bid received from the entities referred to above shall be accepted by Management 
Company and will determine the value of the Receivables. If no relevant offer is received from 
any third parties, then the Receivables shall remain as assets of the Fund, without prejudice 
to the possibility of the Management Company to start a new bidding process for the sale of 
the Receivables. 
Any amount received from the Seller or a third party in connection with the above will be 
credited to the Cash Flow Account and shall form part of the Available Funds to be applied in 
accordance with the Post-Enforcement Priority of Payments set out in section 3.4.7.3 of the 
Additional Information. 
Common provisions 
The purchase price paid by the Seller or the third party will be credited to the Cash Flow 
Account and shall form part of the Available Funds to be applied in accordance with the Post-
Enforcement Priority of Payments set out in section 3.4.7.3 of the Additional Information. 
For the above purposes, the payment obligations under the Notes on the Early Redemption 
Date shall be equal to the Principal Amount Outstanding of the Notes on that date plus the 
accrued and unpaid interest to that date. Such amounts shall be deemed due and payable 
(líquido, vencido y exigible) to all legal effects on the Early Liquidation Date. 
The Management Company shall be entitled to sell the Receivables even if the holders of any 
of the Classes of Notes suffer a loss. 
The above procedure does not entitle the automatic liquidation of the underlying Receivables 
for the purposes of article 21.4 of the EU Securitisation Regulation. 
Notice of the liquidation of the Fund will be provided to the CNMV by publishing the 
appropriate insider information (información privilegiada) or other relevant information (otra 
información relevante) and thereafter to the Noteholders and the Rating Agencies in the 
manner established in section 4.2.3 of the Additional Information, at least thirty (30) Business 
Days in advance to the date on which the Notes are to be redeemed (the “Early Liquidation 
Date”). 
4.4.3.3. 
Early liquidation of the Fund at the Seller’s initiative 
The Seller will have the option (but not the obligation) at its own discretion to instruct the 
Management Company to carry out an Early Liquidation of the Fund and an Early Redemption 
of the Notes in whole (but not in part) and hence repurchase all outstanding Receivables if 
any of the following events occur (the “Seller’s Call Options”, each of them a “Seller Call 
Option”):  
 
If a Clean-up Call Event occurs (the right of the Seller to repurchase at its own 
discretion all outstanding Receivables and hence instruct the Management Company 
to carry out the Early Liquidation of the Fund and the Early Redemption of the Notes 
in whole (but not in part) when a Clean-Up Call Event occurs, the “Clean-up Call 
Option”); 
 
If a Regulatory Change Event occurs (the right to repurchase the Receivables under 
these circumstances, the “Regulatory Change Call Option”); and 
 
If a Tax Change Event occurs (the right to repurchase the Receivables under these 
circumstances, the “Tax Change Call Option”). 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 - Registration Document for Asset-Backed Securities  
Page 36 
The Clean-Up Call Option, the Regulatory Change Call Option and the Tax Change Call Option 
can only be exercised by the Seller to the extent that the Repurchase Value together with the 
rest of Available Funds are sufficient to redeem the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the 
Class C Notes, the Class D Notes and the Class E Notes in whole at par together with all 
accrued but unpaid interest thereon taking into account the Post-Enforcement Priority of 
Payments contemplated in section 3.4.7.3 of the Additional Information. 
Therefore, the exercise of any of the Seller’s Call Options may result in the Principal Amount 
Outstanding of Class F Notes not being totally or partially redeemed. 
For these purposes Clean-Up Call Event, Tax Change Event, and, Regulatory Change Event 
are defined in section 1.2.4 of the Risk Factors. 
It is understood that the declaration of a Regulatory Change Event will not be prevented by 
the fact that, prior to the Date of Incorporation: 
 
the event constituting any such Regulatory Change Event was:  
(i) 
announced or contained in any proposal (whether in draft or final form) for a 
change in the laws, regulations, applicable regulatory rules, policies or 
guidelines (including any accord, standard, or recommendation of the Basel 
Committee on Banking Supervision), as officially interpreted, implemented or 
applied by the European Central Bank, the PRA or the European Union; or  
(ii) 
incorporated in any law or regulation approved and/or published but the 
effectiveness or application of which is deferred, in whole or in part, beyond the 
Date of Incorporation, provided that the application of the EU Securitisation 
Regulation and the applicable legislation shall not constitute a Regulatory 
Change Event, but without prejudice to the ability of a Regulatory Change Event 
to occur as a result of any implementing regulations, policies or guidelines in 
respect thereof announced or published after the Date of Incorporation; or 
(iii) 
expressed in any statement by an official of the competent authority in expert 
meetings or other discussions in connection with such Regulatory Change Event 
(but without receipt of an official interpretation or other official communication); 
or  
 
the competent authority issued any notification, took any decision or expressed any 
view with respect to any individual transaction, other than this transaction.  
Accordingly, such proposals, statements, notifications or views are not taken into account 
when assessing the rate of return on capital of the Fund and/or Seller or an increase of the 
cost or reduction of benefits to the Seller of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction 
Documents immediately after the Date of Incorporation. 
In order for the Seller to exercise any of the Seller’s Call Options, the Seller and the 
Management Company, as applicable, shall take the following actions: 
 
The Seller shall calculate the Repurchase Value to be paid in consideration of the 
repurchased Receivables. 
 
The Seller shall provide written notice to the Issuer and the Rating Agencies of its 
intention to exercise the relevant Seller’s Call Option at least forty (40) Business Days 
prior to the Early Liquidation Date; and 
 
the Management Company shall then inform the Noteholders by publishing the 
appropriate insider information (información privilegiada) or other relevant information 
(otra información relevante) with CNMV (the “Early Liquidation Notice”) at least 
thirty (30) Business Days in advance of the Early Liquidation Date. 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 - Registration Document for Asset-Backed Securities  
Page 37 
The above procedure does not entitle the automatic liquidation of the underlying Receivables 
for the purposes of article 21.4 of the EU Securitisation Regulation. 
4.4.4. 
CANCELLATION OF THE FUND 
Cancellation of the Fund shall take place:  
 
upon full repayment of the Receivables pooled therein; 
 
upon full repayment of all the obligations of the Fund towards its creditors; 
 
upon completion of the process of Early Liquidation of the Fund established in sections 
4.4.3.1, 4.4.3.2 and 4.4.3.3 above following any Enforcement Event; 
 
upon reaching the Legal Maturity Date;  
 
if the provisional credit ratings of the Rated Notes are not confirmed as final by the 
Rating Agencies on or prior to the Disbursement Date (and, in any case, prior to the 
effective disbursement of the Notes), unless such provisional ratings are upgraded; or 
 
if the Management, Placement and Subscription Agreement is fully terminated in 
accordance with the provisions of section 4.2.3 of the Securities Note. 
The circumstances described in sub-paragraphs (e) and (f) above would imply that no 
disbursement of the Notes would take place on the Disbursement Date.  
Upon the occurrence of any of the events described above, the Management Company shall 
inform the CNMV and the Rating Agencies, in the manner provided for in section 4.2.3 of the 
Additional Information and shall initiate the relevant formalities for the cancellation of the 
Fund. 
4.4.5.

Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes and the Class E 
Notes), plus accrued and unpaid interest from the last Payment Dates to the Early 
Liquidation Date, less any tax withholding and free of any expenses for the Noteholder, 
all in accordance with the Post-Enforcement Priority of Payments as set out in section 
3.4.7.3 of the Additional Information. All such amounts will, for all legal purposes, be

Date.

(the “Transfer Tax and Stamp Duty Act”); general regulations regarding tax management 
and inspection courses of action and procedures and developing the common rules of tax 
application procedures, passed by Royal Decree 1065/2007, of 27 July (Reglamento General

las normas comunes de los procedimientos de aplicación de los tributos, aprobado por el Real 
Decreto 1065/2007, de 27 de julio) (“General Tax Regulations”) and, in particular, articles

de crédito) (“Law 10/2014”) and in particular, the First Additional Provision of such Law. 
The referred regulation essentially defines the following fundamental principles:  
 
The Fund is exempt from the concept of “Capital Duty” (Operaciones Societarias) 
(article 45.I.B.20.4 of the Transfer Tax and Stamp Duty Act).  
 
The incorporation and winding up of the Fund are either not subject or exempt from 
all the modalities of Transfer Tax and Stamp Duty Tax (Transmisiones Patrimoniales 
Onerosas y Actos Jurídicos Documentados). 
 
According to article 7.1.h) of Law 27/2014, the Fund is a taxpayer of the Corporate 
Income Tax. The Fund is subject to the general provisions of the Corporate Income 
Tax. The amount subject to this tax is calculated in accordance with the provisions of 
Section IV of Law 27/2014. The general rate in force is twenty-five per cent (25%). 
 
In this regard, rule 13 of Circular 2/2016 sets forth the criteria through which 
securitisation funds must carry out the pertaining value adjustments resulting from 
drops in the value of the financial assets. article 13.1 of Law 27/2014 states that, the 
regulation of the Corporate Income Tax (the “CIT Regulation”), will govern the 
circumstances determining the deductibility of value adjustments made on account of 
losses in the value of debt securities valued at amortised cost and included in 
mortgage-backed securities funds and asset-backed securities funds. 
 
Notwithstanding, upon the amendment introduced by Royal Decree 683/2017 June 30, 
in article 9 of the CIT Regulation, the 7th Transitory Provision has been incorporated. 
According to this Transitory Provision, to the extent the wording of the Circular 2/2016 
is not amended in respect of the impairment of the value of debt securities valued at 
amortised cost included in the securitisation funds referred to in Law 5/2015, the tax 
deductibility of said impairment provisions will be determined according to the wording 
of article 9 of the CIT Regulation as drafted on December 31, 2015. 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 - Registration Document for Asset-Backed Securities  
Page 41 
 
Pursuant to article 16 of Law 27/2014, the limitation to the tax deductibility of financial 
expenses shall apply to the Fund in tax years beginning from January 1, 2024 onward, 
according to the amendment introduced in article 16.6 of Law 27/2014 by the Fifth 
Final Provision of Law 13/2023, of 24 May. 
 
According to article 61.k) of the CIT Regulation, income from mortgage participating 
units, loans and other Receivables that constitute revenue items for the securitisation 
funds are not subject to withholding tax.  
 
The Fund will be subject to VAT in accordance with the general VAT rules. The 
management services provided to the Fund by the Management Company will be 
exempt from VAT, pursuant to the provisions of article 20.One. 18 n) of the VAT Act. 
 
The issuance, subscription, transfer, redemption and repayment of the Notes, 
depending on whether the investor is a corporation for the purposes of Value Added 
tax, will be “not subject” or “exempt”, according to each case, from Value Added Tax 
(article 20.1.18 of the VAT Act) and Transfer Tax/Stamp Duty (article 45.I.B.15 of the 
Transfer Tax and Stamp Duty Act). 
 
The input VAT borne by the Fund shall not be deductible for VAT purposes but they 
shall be treated as a deductible expenses for CIT purposes. The assignment of the 
Receivables to the Fund is a transaction that is subject to but exempt from VAT in 
accordance with the provisions of article 20.One.18º e) of the VAT Act. 
 
The assignment of the Receivables to the Fund is a transaction that is not subject to 
Transfer Tax. Likewise, it would not be subject to Stamp Duty as long as the 
requirements foreseen in article 31.2 of the Transfer and Stamp Duty Act are not 
fulfilled.  
 
The Management Company, in the name and on behalf of the Fund, must comply with 
reporting obligations, amongst others, with those set out in the First Additional 
Provision of Law 10/2014. The procedure for complying with said reporting obligations 
is developed by articles 42, 43 and 44 of the General Tax Regulations.

investors” other than the “originator”, “sponsor” or “original lender” (as defined in the EU

securitisations. Particularly, each such investor and potential investor in the Notes shall

Regulation (the “EU Due Diligence Requirements”).

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
For the purposes of article 4 of the Securities Markets Act: 
 
BANCO SANTANDER, S.A. and SANTANDER DE TITULIZACIÓN, S.G.F.T., S.A. both form part of 
the Santander Group. 
 
According to the information available on the EU Securitisation Repository’s website, 
MDBRS has a 7.00% interest in the share capital of the EU Securitisation Repository. 
 
There is no knowledge of the existence of any other relationship involving direct or 
indirect ownership or control between the aforementioned legal persons that 
participate in the securitisation transaction. 
In addition, it should be noted that certain parties to the Transaction Documents (the 
“Transaction Parties”) have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, investment 
banking and/or commercial banking or other services for the Fund, the Seller or its affiliates 
and the Management Company in the ordinary course of business. Other Transaction Parties 
may also perform multiple roles. Accordingly, conflicts of interest may exist or may arise as 
a result of or in connection with parties having previously engaged or in the future engaging 
in transactions with other parties, having multiple roles or carrying out other transactions for 
third parties. The Transaction Parties may be replaced by one or more new parties. It cannot 
be excluded that such a new party could also have a potential conflicting interest, which might 
ultimately have a negative impact on the ability of the Fund to perform its obligations in 
respect of the Notes. 
In particular, the Arranger and the Joint Lead Managers are part of global investment banking 
and securities and investment management firms that provide a wide range of financial 
services to a substantial and diversified client base that includes corporations, financial 
institutions, governments and high-net-worth individuals. As such, they actively make 
markets in and trade financial instruments for their own account and for the accounts of 
customers in the ordinary course of their business. 
The Arranger and the Joint Lead Managers and their affiliates may play various roles in 
relation to the offering of the Notes, and they may also become beneficial owners of any Note. 
Additionally, significant concentrations of holdings in respect of the Class A Notes may occur. 
In particular, it is expected that the Principal Amount Outstanding of the Class A Notes will, 
promptly following issue, be held by one or more investors, who may be subject to different 
economic terms from those set out herein in this Prospectus. 
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the duties of the Arranger, the Joint 
Lead Managers and/or their affiliates in respect of the Notes are limited to the relevant 
contractual obligations set out in the Transaction Documents (if any) to which they are a 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 - Securities Note for Wholesale Non-Equity Securities  
Page 64 
party and will not, by virtue of them or any of their affiliates’ acting in any other capacity, be 
deemed to have any other duties or responsibilities or be deemed to be held to a standard of 
care other than as expressly provided therein. In particular, no advisory or fiduciary duty is 
owed to any person. None of the Arranger, the Joint Lead Managers or any of their affiliates 
shall have any obligation to account to the Fund, any party to the Transaction Documents or 
any Noteholder for any profit as a result of any other business that it may conduct with either 
the Fund or any other party to the Transaction Documents. 
The Arranger and the Joint Lead Managers may assist clients and counterparties in 
transactions related to the Notes (including assisting clients in future purchases and sales of 
the Notes and hedging transactions). The Arranger and the Joint Lead Managers expect to 
earn fees and other revenues from these transactions. If any of the Joint Lead Managers 
and/or their affiliates becomes a beneficial owner of any Note, it will exercise the rights 
associated with such Note in its own discretion, which may or may not be in accordance with 
the best interest of other holders of the Notes. Each Joint Lead Manager in the course of its 
business may act independently of any other Joint Lead Manager. 
Nothing in the Transaction Documents shall prevent any party to the transaction from 
rendering services similar to those provided for in the Transaction Documents to other 
persons, firms or companies or from carrying on any business similar to or in competition 
with the business of any party to the transaction. 
Accordingly, conflicts of interest may exist or may arise as a result of parties to this 
transaction: (i) having previously engaged or in the future engaging in transactions with other 
parties to the transaction; (ii) having multiple roles in this transaction; and/or (iii) carrying 
out other roles or transactions for third parties. 
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, none of the Arranger, the Joint Lead 
Managers and/or their affiliates are restricted from entering into, performing or enforcing its 
rights in respect of the Transaction Documents, the Notes, or the interests described above 
and may otherwise continue or take steps to further or protect any of those interests and its 
business even where to do so may be in conflict with the interests of Noteholders, and in so 
doing may act in its own commercial interests and without notice to, and without regard to, 
the interests of any such person.

The use and estimated net amount of the proceeds 
The net amount of the proceeds from the issue of the Notes is ONE BILLION FIVE HUNDRED

UNDERWRITING AND PLACEMENT OF THE NOTES 
The Management Company, in the name and on behalf of the Fund, shall enter into a 
management, placement and subscription agreement on the Date of Incorporation with (i) 
Banco Santander as Arranger, Joint Lead Manager and Seller; and (ii) Credit Agricole CIB, 
UniCredit and BofA Securities, as Joint Lead Managers (the “Management, Placement and 
Subscription Agreement”). 
In accordance with the Management, Placement and Subscription Agreement: 
 
The Joint Lead Managers will, on a several, but not joint (mancomunada) and best-
efforts basis and upon the satisfaction of the conditions precedent, procure subscription 
for and place the Notes (of any Class) during the Subscription Period with qualified 
investors (for the purposes of article 2(e) of the Prospectus Regulation); 
Notwithstanding the above, one or more of the Joint Lead Managers (or any entity 
belonging to the group of each Joint Lead Manager, as the case may be) may subscribe 
for and purchase Notes (of any Class) during the Subscription Period, without the 
foregoing implying in any way an underwriting commitment by the Joint Lead 
Managers. 
The Seller will subscribe the Notes not placed among qualified investors by the Joint 
Lead Managers 
The Seller will receive no fee in consideration thereof. 
Without prejudice to the obligation of Banco Santander, as Seller, set out in paragraph (c) 
above, no additional underwriting commitment by the Joint Lead Managers is agreed in the 
Management, Placement and Subscription Agreement. 
The Joint Lead Managers may give a termination notice of the Management, Placement and 
Subscription Agreement to the Seller and the Management Company at any time before 12.00 
p.m. CET on the Disbursement Date upon occurrence of any of the following termination 
events: 
(a) Breach of obligations: any of the conditions precedent established in the Management, 
Placement and Subscription Agreement have not been met when applicable pursuant to 
its terms or any party (other than the Joint Lead Managers) fails to perform any of its 
obligations under the Management, Placement and Subscription Agreement; in particular, 
in case that the Seller elects not to, or otherwise fails to (in all cases by the end of the 
relevant time limit) subscribe for and purchase any remaining Notes that the Joint Lead 
Managers have not procured subscription for. 
(b) Force majeure: since the date of the Management, Placement and Subscription 
Agreement there has been, in the reasonable opinion of the Joint Lead Managers, in 
consultation with the Management Company, an event that could not be foreseen or, 
even if foreseen, is inevitable rendering it impossible to perform the subscription or 
disbursement of the Notes or the success of the placement of the Notes pursuant to 
article 1,105 of the Spanish Civil Code (force majeure).  
(c) Material adverse change: there has been, in the opinion of the Joint Lead Managers, 
a material adverse change, and meaning any adverse change, development or event in 
(i) the condition (financial or otherwise), business, prospects, results of operations or 
general affairs of the Seller or (ii) the national or international financial, political or 
economic conditions or currency exchange rates or exchange controls since the Date of 
Incorporation which would be likely to materially prejudice the success of the offering, 
placement, subscription and/or purchase of the Notes or dealing in the Notes in the

requirements of the United States Securities Act and applicable state or local securities laws. 
The Notes are in dematerialised form and are subject to U.S. tax law requirements. The Notes 
are being offered for sale outside the United States in accordance with Regulation S under 
the United States Securities Act. Neither the United States Securities and Exchange 
Commission, nor any state securities commission or any other regulatory authority, has 
approved or disapproved the Notes or determined that this Prospectus is truthful or complete. 
Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offence. 
Neither the Arranger, nor the Joint Lead Managers, nor any of their affiliates makes any 
representation to any prospective investor or purchaser of the Notes as to whether the 
transactions described in this Prospectus comply as a matter of fact with the U.S. Risk 
Retention Rules on the Date of Incorporation or at any time in the future. Investors should

consult their own advisers as to the U.S. Risk Retention Rules. No predictions can be made 
as to the precise effects of such matters on any investor or otherwise. 
4.2.5. 
VOLCKER RULE 
Under “the Volcker Rule”, U.S. banks, non-U.S. banks with U.S. branches or agencies, 
companies that control U.S. banks, and their U.S. and non-U.S. affiliates (collectively, the 
“Relevant Banking Entities” as defined under the Volcker Rule) are prohibited from, inter alia, 
acquiring or retaining any ownership interest in, or acting as sponsor in respect of, certain 
investment entities referred to in the Volcker Rule as covered funds, except as may be 
permitted by an applicable exclusion or exception from the Volcker Rule. In addition, in certain 
circumstances, the Volcker Rule restricts Relevant Banking Entities from entering into certain 
credit exposure related transactions with covered funds.  
Neither the Issuer, nor the Arranger, nor any Joint Lead Manager, nor the Management 
Company has made any determination as to whether the Issuer would be a “covered fund” 
for purposes of the Volcker Rule. If the Issuer were considered a “covered fund”, the price 
and liquidity of the market for the Notes may be materially and adversely affected. 
There is limited interpretive guidance regarding the Volcker Rule, and implementation of the 
regulatory framework for the Volcker Rule is still evolving including through revisions of the 
Volcker Rule that became effective on 1 October 2020. The Volcker Rule’s prohibitions and 
lack of interpretive guidance could negatively impact the liquidity and value of the Notes. Any 
entity that is a “Relevant Banking Entity” and is considering an investment in the Notes should 
consider the potential impact of the Volcker Rule, including the recent revisions, in respect of 
such investment and on its portfolio generally. Each purchaser must determine for itself 
whether it is a Relevant Banking Entity. Neither the Issuer nor the Arranger nor the 
Management Company nor any Joint Lead Manager make any representation regarding the 
ability of any purchaser to acquire or hold the Notes, now or at any time in the future. 
4.3.

Interest payments of the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes are placed eighth (8th) and 
tenth (10th) in the Pre-Enforcement Priority of Payments, respectively. However: 
 
With respect to the Class E Notes: upon the occurrence of a Class E and Class F Notes 
Interest Deferral Trigger, interest payments of the Class E Notes would be deferred 
and therefore would be placed twelfth (12th) in the Pre-Enforcement Priority of 
Payments, provided that Class E Notes is not the Most Senior Class of Notes.

(i) 
upon the occurrence of a Class E and Class F Notes Interest Deferral Trigger, 
provided that Class F Notes is not the Most Senior Class of Notes; or 
(ii) 
If the Required Level of the Reserve Fund is equal to 0, 
interest payments of the Class F Notes would be deferred and therefore would 
be placed thirteenth (13th) in the Pre-Enforcement Priority of Payments. 
For these purposes, “Class E and Class F Notes Interest Deferral Trigger” means a 
Cumulative Default Ratio higher than 4.25%.

and Class E Notes on the Disbursement Date; or 
(4) 
tax regulations are amended in such a way that the assignment of Additional

POTENTIAL IMPACT ON THE INVESTMENT IN THE EVENT OF A RESOLUTION UNDER BRRD 
Directive 2014/59/EU, of May 15 establishing a framework for the recovery and resolution of 
credit institutions and investment firms and amending Council Directive 82/891/EEC, and 
Directives 2001/24/EC, 2002/47/EC, 2004/25/EC, 2005/56/EC, 2007/36/EC, 2011/35/EU, 
2012/30/EU and 2013/36/EU, and Regulations (EU) No 1093/2010 and (EU) No 648/2012, 
of the European Parliament and of the Council (“BRRD”) does not apply to the Fund, as Issuer 
of the Notes.  
4.7. 
Description of the rights, including any limitations of these, attached to the 
securities and procedure for the exercise of said rights 
Pursuant to current legislation in force, the Notes described in this Securities Note do not 
create any present and/or future political rights for the investor acquiring them in relation to 
the Fund or its Management Company. This is consistent with the nature of a «fondo de 
titulización» as a separate estate (patrimonio separado) devoid of legal personality. 
The economic rights of the investor associated with the acquisition and holding of the Notes 
will be those deriving from the interest rates, yields and redemption prices with which the 
Notes are issued as set forth in sections 4.8 and 4.9 below. 
The Noteholders are subject, with respect to the payment of interest and principal repayment 
of the Notes, to the Pre-Enforcement Priority of Payments or the Post-Enforcement Priority of 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 - Securities Note for Wholesale Non-Equity Securities  
Page 76 
Payments, as applicable, set forth in sections 3.4.7.2 and 3.4.7.3 of the Additional 
Information, respectively. 
The Noteholders and the other creditors of the Fund will have no recourse against the 
Management Company, other than for non-performance of its duties or non-compliance with 
the provisions of the Deed of Incorporation, the rest of the Transaction Documents and the 
applicable laws and regulations. 
In particular, the Noteholders and the other creditors of the Fund will have no recourse 
whatsoever against the Fund or the Management Company based on (i) delinquency or 
prepayment of the Receivables; (ii) non-fulfilment by the counterparties to the Transaction 
Documents entered in the name and on behalf of the Fund; or (iii) shortfall of the credit 
enhancements to cover the payments of the Notes. 
The Noteholders shall have no actions against the Borrowers that have failed to comply with 
their payment obligations under the Loans. Pursuant to applicable law, the Management 
Company is the only authorised representative of the Fund as regards third parties and in 
any legal proceedings (without prejudice to any rights of representation that may be granted 
by the Management Company to third parties). 
In addition to the Seller´s responsibilities assumed for the information contained in the 
Securities Note and the Additional Information under this Prospectus, the Transaction 
Documents comprehend obligations for the Seller and for the other participating entities to 
such Transaction Documents to which each of them is a party.  
Each of the Noteholders by purchasing or subscribing the Notes agrees with the Fund that:  
 
sums payable to each Noteholder in respect of the Fund’s obligations to such 
Noteholder shall be limited to the lesser of (i) the aggregate amount of all sums due 
and payable to such Noteholder and (ii) the aggregate amounts of the Available Funds, 
net of any sums which are payable to other persons in priority to or pari passu with 
such Noteholder in accordance with the Pre-Enforcement Priority of Payments or the 
Post-Enforcement Priority of Payments, as applicable, set forth in sections 3.4.7.2 and 
3.4.7.3 of the Additional Information, respectively; 
 
upon liquidation of the Fund following final distribution of the Available Funds, the 
Noteholders shall have no further claim against the Fund in respect of any unpaid 
amounts and such unpaid amounts shall be discharged in full; 
 
none of the Management Company, the Arranger, any Joint Lead Manager and any 
other Transaction Parties shall be responsible for any of the Fund’s liabilities;  
 
in particular, the Noteholders shall not have any right of action against the 
Management Company other than by reason of non-performance of its duties or non-
compliance with the provisions of the Deed of Incorporation and the applicable laws 
and regulations; and 
 
no meeting of creditors (junta de acreedores) will be established. 
Various potential and actual conflicts of interest may arise between the interests of the 
Noteholders, on the one hand, and the interests of any of the Transaction Parties, on the 
other hand, as a result of the various businesses and activities of the Transaction Parties, and 
none of such persons is required to resolve such conflicts of interest in favour of the 
Noteholders except for the obligations legally vested on the Management Company, who, 
pursuant to article 26.1.f) of Law 5/2015 has in place procedural and organisational measures 
to prevent potential conflicts of interests.  


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 - Securities Note for Wholesale Non-Equity Securities  
Page 77 
The Management Company will be liable to the Noteholders and other creditors (i.e., from 
time to time, those parties that hold a creditor position against the Fund, such as the Start-
Up Expenses Loan Provider) of the Fund for all damages caused thereto by a breach of its 
obligations. It will be liable for the penalties applicable thereto pursuant to the provisions of 
Law 5/2015.  
All matters, disputes, actions and claims concerning the Fund or the Notes issued and that 
may arise during the operation or liquidation thereof, whether among the Noteholders or 
between the Noteholders and the Management Company, will be submitted to the courts of 
the city of Madrid, waiving any other forum to which the parties may be entitled. 
4.8. 
Nominal interest rate and provisions relating to interest payable 
4.8.1. 
NOMINAL INTEREST 
The Notes, shall accrue, from the Disbursement Date until their full redemption, floating 
nominal interest on its Principal Amount Outstanding (the “Interest Rate”). 
The Interest Rate shall be payable quarterly on each Payment Date (as defined below), 
according to the ranking established in the Pre-Enforcement Priority of Payments or the Post-
Enforcement Priority of Payments, as the case may be, provided in each case that the Fund 
has sufficient Available Funds or Post-Enforcement Available Funds, as applicable. 
Any interest due and unpaid under the Notes will not accrue any additional interest or default 
interest and will not be added to the Principal Amount Outstanding of the Notes. 
However, if on any Payment Date, the Fund defaults in the payment of any interest due and 
payable in respect of the Most Senior Class of Notes (unless, where the Class F Notes are the 
Most Senior Class of Notes) and such default continues for a period of at least five (5) Business 
Days, the Management Company shall declare the occurrence of an Issuer Event of Default 
in the conditions set forth in section 4.4.3.1 of the Registration Document are met (which 
would imply the Early Liquidation of the Fund and the Early Redemption of the Notes). 
Calculation of interest will be rounded to four decimal places with the mid-point rounded up. 
4.8.2. 
INTEREST ACCRUAL PERIODS 
The term of the issue of the Notes will be divided into successive interest accrual periods 
comprising the days elapsed between each Payment Date (each an “Interest Accrual 
Period”). Each Interest Accrual Period will begin on (and including) the previous Payment 
Date and end on (but excluding) the final Payment Date of each Interest Accrual Period.  
Exceptionally: 
 
the first Interest Accrual Period will have a duration larger than three months, 
beginning on the Disbursement Date (inclusive) and ending on the First Payment Date 
(not included) (the “Initial Interest Accrual Period”); and 
 
the last Interest Accrual Period will begin on the last Payment Date prior to liquidation 
of the Fund (inclusive) and will end on the Notes Maturity Date (not included).

Page 78 
resulting Interest Rate falls below 0 (zero), the applicable Interest Rate shall be equal 
to 0 (zero); 
 
in respect of the Class B Notes, a floating rate equal to the Reference Rate plus a 
margin of 1.20% per annum (the “Class B Interest Rate”), provided that, if such 
resulting Interest Rate falls below 0 (zero), the applicable Interest Rate shall be equal 
to 0 (zero); 
 
in respect of the Class C Notes, a floating rate equal to the Reference Rate plus a

to 0 (zero); and  
 
in relation to the Class F Notes, a floating rate equal to the Reference Rate plus a 
margin of 5.24% per annum (the “Class F Interest Rate”), provided that, if such 
resulting Interest Rate falls below 0 (zero), the applicable Interest Rate shall be equal

The Management Company shall, based on the information provided by Banco Santander, 
determine the Interest Rate applicable to the Notes for the relevant Interest Accrual Period 
two (2) Business Days prior to the relevant Payment Date, except for the Initial Interest 
Accrual Period, where the Interest Rate applicable to the Notes shall be determined on the 
Date of Incorporation (the “Reference Rate Determination Date”). 
The Management Company (i) shall notify the Interest Rate to the Paying Agent at least one 
(1) Business Day in advance to each Payment Date (or such other date as agreed between 
the Management Company and the Paying Agent from time to time) and (ii) only applicable 
in respect of the Initial Interest Accrual Period, shall notify the Joint Lead Managers in writing 
on that same date. The Management Company will also communicate this information to AIAF 
and IBERCLEAR. 
The Interest Rate for subsequent Interest Accrual Periods shall be communicated to 
Noteholders within the deadline and in the manner set forth in section 4.2.1 and 4.2.3 of the 
Additional Information. 
4.8.4. 
REFERENCE RATE 
The reference rate (the “Reference Rate”) for determining the Interest Rate is as follows:  
 
The EURIBOR for the three-month Euro deposits which appears on Reuters EURIBOR01 
(or any other page that replaces this page in the future) at or about 11.00 a.m. CET 
on the Reference Rate Determination Date (the “Screen Rate”). 
If the definition, methodology, formula or any other form of calculation related to the 
EURIBOR were modified (including any modification or amendment derived of the 
compliance of the Benchmark Regulation), the modifications shall be considered to be 
made for the purposes of the Reference Rate relating to EURIBOR without the need to 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 - Securities Note for Wholesale Non-Equity Securities  
Page 79 
modify the terms of the Reference Rate and without the need to notify the Noteholders, 
as such references to the EURIBOR rate shall be made to the EURIBOR rate such as 
this had been modified. 
 
By way of exception, the Reference Rate for the Initial Interest Accrual Period will result 
from the linear interpolation of the 3-month EURIBOR rate and the 6-month EURIBOR 
rate quoted at or about 11.00 a.m. CET on the Date of Incorporation, according to the 
following formula: 
 
Where: 
R 
Reference Rate for the first Interest Accrual Period. 
dt 
Number of days of the first Interest Accrual Period. 
d2 
Number of days corresponding to the 3-month EURIBOR 
d3 
Number of days corresponding to the 6-month EURIBOR 
E2 
3-month EURIBOR rate 
E3 
6-month EURIBOR rate 
 
 
If the Screen Rate is unavailable at such time for Euro deposits for the relevant period, 
then the rate for any relevant period shall be determined in accordance with section 
4.8.5 of the Securities Note below. 
Banco Santander shall communicate to the Management Company by email, before 12.00 
p.m. CET on each Reference Rate Determination Date, the Reference Rate including the 
supporting documentation for such calculations.  
As at the date of this Prospectus, EURIBOR is provided and administered by the EUROPEAN 
MONEY MARKETS INSTITUTE (“EMMI”). EMMI is included on the register of administrators and 
benchmarks established and maintained by the EUROPEAN SECURITIES AND MARKETS AUTHORITY 
(ESMA) pursuant to article 36 of the Benchmark Regulation. 
4.8.5. 
FALLBACK PROVISIONS 
Base Rate Modification Event: terms and conditions 
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the following provisions will apply if the 
Management Company, in the name and on behalf of the Fund (acting on the advice 
of the Seller) determines that any of the following events (each a “Base Rate 
Modification Event”) has occurred:  
(i) 
a material disruption to EURIBOR, an adverse change in the methodology of 
calculating EURIBOR or EURIBOR ceasing to exist or to be published; or 
(ii) 
the insolvency or cessation of business of the EURIBOR administrator (in 
circumstances where no successor EURIBOR administrator has been appointed); 
or 
(iii) 
a public statement by the EURIBOR administrator that it will cease publishing 
EURIBOR permanently or indefinitely (in circumstances where no successor 
EURIBOR administrator has been appointed that will continue publication of 
EURIBOR or will be changed in an adverse manner); or 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 - Securities Note for Wholesale Non-Equity Securities  
Page 80 
(iv) 
a public statement by the EURIBOR administrator that EURIBOR will not be 
included in the register under Article 36 of the Benchmark Regulation 
permanently or indefinitely; 
(v) 
a public statement by the supervisor of the EURIBOR administrator that 
EURIBOR has been or will be permanently or indefinitely discontinued or will be 
changed in an adverse manner; or 
(vi) 
a public statement by the supervisor of the EURIBOR administrator which means 
that EURIBOR may no longer be used or that its use is subject to restrictions or 
adverse consequences; or  
(vii) 
a public announcement of the permanent or indefinite discontinuity of EURIBOR 
as it applies to the Notes; or  
(viii) the reasonable expectation of the Management Company, in the name and on 
behalf of the Fund (acting on the advice of the Seller) that any of the events 
specified in sub-paragraphs (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi) or (vii) above will occur 
or exist within six (6) months of the proposed effective date of such Base Rate 
Modification.  
 
Following the occurrence of a Base Rate Modification Event, the Management 
Company, in the name and on behalf of the Fund (acting on the advice of the Seller) 
will (i) inform the Swap Counterparty, and (ii) appoint a rate determination agent to 
carry out the tasks referred to in this section (the “Rate Determination Agent”). 
The Rate Determination Agent will not be Banco Santander or any affiliate of Banco 
Santander and shall be an independent financial institution and dealer of international 
repute in the European Union. 
 
The Rate Determination Agent shall determine an alternative base rate (the 
“Alternative Base Rate”) to substitute EURIBOR as the Reference Rate of the Notes 
and the Start-up Expenses Loan Agreement and those amendments to the Transaction 
Documents to be made by the Management Company, in the name and on behalf of 
the Fund, as are necessary or advisable to facilitate such change (the “Base Rate 
Modification”), provided that no such Base Rate Modification will be made unless the 
Rate Determination Agent has determined and confirmed to the Management Company 
in writing that:  
(i) 
such Base Rate Modification is being undertaken due to the occurrence of a Base 
Rate Modification Event and, in each case, such modification is required solely 
for such purpose and it has been drafted solely to such effect; and 
(ii) 
such Alternative Base Rate is: 
(A) 
a base rate published, endorsed, approved or recognised by the relevant 
regulatory authority or any stock exchange on which the Notes are listed 
or any relevant committee, working group, an industry body recognised 
nationally or internationally as representing participants in the asset 
backed securitisation market generally or other body established, 
sponsored or approved by any of the foregoing; or 
(B) 
a base rate utilised in a material number of publicly-listed new issues of 
Euro denominated asset backed floating rate notes prior to the effective 
date of such Base Rate Modification; or 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 - Securities Note for Wholesale Non-Equity Securities  
Page 81 
(C) 
a base rate utilised in a publicly-listed new issue of Euro denominated 
asset backed floating rate notes where the originator of the relevant 
assets is the Seller or an affiliate of the Seller banking group; or 
(D) 
such other base rate as the Rate Determination Agent reasonably 
determines (and in relation to which the Rate Determination Agent has 
provided reasonable justification of its determination to the Management 
Company), 
provided that, for the avoidance of doubt (i) in each case, the change to the Alternative 
Base Rate will not, in the Management Company’s opinion, be materially prejudicial to 
the interest of the Noteholders and the Start-Up Expenses Loan Provider; (ii) the Rate 
Determination Agent may propose an Alternative Base Rate on more than one occasion 
provided that the conditions set out in this section (c) are satisfied, and (iii) the 
Alternative Base Rate shall fulfil the Benchmark Regulation. 
By subscribing the Notes, each Noteholder acknowledges and agrees with any 
amendments to the Transaction Documents made by the Management Company, in 
the name and on behalf of the Fund, which may be necessary or advisable in order to 
facilitate the Base Rate Modification. 
 
It is a condition to any such Base Rate Modification that: 
(i) 
the Seller pays (or arranges for the payment of) all fees, costs and expenses 
(including legal fees) properly incurred by the Management Company and each 
other applicable party including, without limitation, any of the Transaction 
Parties, in connection with such modifications. For the avoidance of doubt, such 
costs shall not include any amount in respect of any reduction in the interest 
payable to a Noteholder or any change in the amount due to the Swap 
Counterparty or any change in the mark-to-market value of the Interest Rate 
Swap Agreement; and 
(ii) 
with respect to each Rating Agency, the Management Company shall notify such 
Rating Agency of the proposed modification and, in the Management Company’s 
reasonable opinion, formed on the basis of due consideration and consultation 
with such Rating Agency (including, as applicable, upon receipt of oral or written 
(as applicable) confirmation from an appropriately authorised person at such 
Rating Agency), such modification would not result in (x) a downgrade, 
withdrawal or suspension of the then current ratings assigned to the Rated Notes 
by such Rating Agency or (y) such Rating Agency placing the Rated Notes on 
rating watch negative (or equivalent). 
 
When implementing any modification pursuant to this section, the Rate Determination 
Agent, the Management Company and the Seller, as applicable, shall act in good faith 
and (in the absence of gross negligence or wilful misconduct), shall have no 
responsibility whatsoever to the Noteholders or any other party. 
 
If a Base Rate Modification is not made as a result of the application of section (c) 
above, and for so long as the Management Company (acting on the advice of the Seller) 
considers that a Base Rate Modification Event is continuing, the Management Company 
may or, upon request of the Seller, must initiate the procedure for a Base Rate 
Modification as set out in this section. 
 
Any modification pursuant to this section must comply with the rules of any stock 
exchange on which the Notes are from time to time listed or admitted to trading and 
may be made on more than one occasion. 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 - Securities Note for Wholesale Non-Equity Securities  
Page 82 
 
As long as a Base Rate Modification is not deemed final and binding in accordance with 
this section, the Reference Rate applicable to the Notes will be equal to the last 
Reference Rate available on the relevant applicable screen rate pursuant to section 
4.8.4 above. 
 
This section shall be without prejudice to the application of any higher interest under 
applicable mandatory law. 
 
The Management Company, acting in the name and on behalf of the Fund, shall give 
at least thirty (30) Business Days’ prior written notice of the proposed Base Rate 
Modification to the Noteholders, the Swap Counterparty, and the Paying Agent before 
publishing a Base Rate Modification Noteholder Notice. 
 
The Management Company, acting in the name and on behalf of the Fund, shall provide 
to the Noteholders a Base Rate Modification Noteholder Notice, at least forty (40) 
calendar days prior to the date on which it is proposed that the Base Rate Modification 
would take effect (such date being no less than ten (10) Business Days prior to the 
next Determination Date). 
 
Noteholders representing at least ten per cent (10%) of the Principal Amount 
Outstanding of the Most Senior Class of Notes on the Base Rate Modification Record 
Date shall have not directed the Management Company in writing (or otherwise 
directed the Paying Agent (acting on behalf of the Fund) in accordance with the then 
current practice of any applicable clearing system through which such Most Senior 
Class of Notes may be held) within such notification period that such Noteholders of 
the Most Senior Class of Notes do not consent to the Base Rate Modification. 
Noteholder negative consent rights 
If Noteholders representing at least ten per cent (10%) of the Principal Amount Outstanding 
of the Most Senior Class of Notes on the Base Rate Modification Record Date have directed 
the Management Company in writing (otherwise directed the Paying Agent in accordance with 
the current practice of any applicable clearing system through which such Most Senior Class 
of Notes may be held) within the notification period referred to above that such Noteholders 
of the Most Senior Class of Notes do not consent to the proposed Base Rate Modification, then 
the proposed Base Rate Modification will not be made and, the Reference Rate applicable to 
the Notes will be equal to the last Reference Rate available on the relevant applicable screen 
rate pursuant to section 4.8.4 above. 
For these purposes: 
“Base Rate Modification Noteholder Notice” means a written notice from the 
Management Company, acting in the name and on behalf of the Fund, to notify Noteholders 
of a proposed Base Rate Modification confirming the following: 
 
the date on which it is proposed that the Base Rate Modification shall take effect; 
 
the period during which Noteholders of the Most Senior Class of Notes who are 
Noteholders on the Base Rate Modification Record Date may object to the proposed 
Base Rate Modification (which notice period shall commence at least forty (40) calendar 
days prior to the date on which it is proposed that the Base Rate Modification would 
take effect and continue for a period of not less than thirty (30) calendar days) and 
the method by which they may object; 
 
the Base Rate Modification Event or Events which has or have occurred; 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 - Securities Note for Wholesale Non-Equity Securities  
Page 83 
 
the Alternative Base Rate which is proposed to be adopted pursuant section 4.8.5.(c) 
of the Securities Note and the rationale for choosing the proposed Alternative Base 
Rate; 
 
details of any modifications that the Issuer has agreed will be made to any hedging 
agreement to which it is party for the purpose of aligning any such hedging agreement 
with proposed Base Rate Modification or, where it has not been possible to agree such 
modifications with hedging counterparties, why such agreement has not been possible 
and the effect that this may have on the transaction (in the view of the Rate 
Determination Agent); and 
 
details of (i) any amendments which the Management Company, acting in the name 
and on behalf of the Issuer, proposes to make to these conditions or any other 
Transaction Document and (ii) any new, supplemental or additional documents into 
which the Management Company, acting in the name and on behalf of the Issuer 
proposes to enter into to facilitate the changes envisaged pursuant to this section. 
“Base Rate Modification Record Date” means the date specified to be the Base Rate 
Modification Record Date in the Base Rate Modification Noteholder Notice. 
4.8.6. 
CALCULATIONS OF NOTES INTEREST AMOUNT 
The interest payable on each Payment Date for each Interest Accrual Period will be carried 
out in accordance with the following formula:  
_I = P*R*d/360_  
Where: 
 I = Interest to be paid on a given Payment Date. 
 P = Principal Amount Outstanding of the Notes on the Determination Date preceding such 
Payment Date.  
 R = Interest Rate expressed as a percentage. 
 d = Number of days actually elapsed in each Interest Accrual Period. 
4.8.7. 
PAYMENT. TIME LIMIT FOR THE VALIDITY OF CLAIMS TO INTEREST AND REPAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL 
Interest on the Notes will be paid until their full redemption on each Payment Date according 
to the Pre-Enforcement Priority of Payments or the Post-Enforcement Priority of Payments, 
as applicable, set forth in sections 3.4.7.2 and 3.4.7.3 of the Additional Information, provided 
that the Fund has sufficient Available Funds or Post-Enforcement Available Funds, as 
applicable. 
In the event that, on a Payment Date, the Fund is totally or partially unable to pay the interest 
accrued on the Notes in accordance with the Pre-Enforcement Priority of Payments or the 
Post-Enforcement Priority of Payments set forth in sections 3.4.7.2 or 3.4.7.3 of the Additional 
Information, respectively, the unpaid amounts will be paid on the following Payment Date on 
which the Fund has sufficient liquidity to do so immediately before the payment of the same 
Class for the new period and without accruing additional or default interest in accordance with 
the aforementioned Pre-Enforcement Priority of Payments, or Post-Enforcement Priority of 
Payments. Amounts deferred will not accrue additional interest (ordinary interest or default 
interest) nor will be added to the Principal Amount Outstanding of the Notes. 
Notwithstanding the above, if on any Payment Date, the Fund defaults in the payment of any 
interest due and payable in respect of the Most Senior Class of Notes (unless, where the Class 
F Notes are the Most Senior Class of Notes) and such default continues for a period of at least 
five (5) Business Days, the Management Company shall declare the occurrence of an Issuer 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 - Securities Note for Wholesale Non-Equity Securities  
Page 84 
Event of Default in the conditions set forth in section 4.4.3.1 of the Registration Document 
are met (which would imply the Early Liquidation of the Fund and the Early Redemption of 
the Notes). 
The Fund, through its Management Company, may not defer the payment of any interest on 
the Notes beyond the Legal Maturity Date of the Fund (subject to the Modified Following 
Business Day Convention). On the Legal Maturity Date following final distribution of the Post-
Enforcement Available Funds, the Noteholders shall have no further claim against the Fund 
in respect of any unpaid amounts and such unpaid amounts shall be discharged in full. 
Withholding, contributions or taxes now or hereafter applicable to the principal, interest or 
returns on the Notes will be the sole responsibility of the Noteholders, and the amount thereof 
will be deducted by the Management Company, on behalf of the Fund, through the Paying 
Agent in the manner provided by law. 
Payment will be made through the Paying Agent, which will use IBERCLEAR and its 
participating institutions to distribute the amounts to the Noteholders in accordance with their 
established procedures. Payment of interests and redemption of principal will be notified to 
the Noteholders in the events and with the notice established for each situation described in 
section 4.2.1 of the Additional Information. 
4.8.8. 
PAYMENT DATES AND INTEREST PERIODS 
Interest in respect of the Notes will accrue on a daily basis and will be payable quarterly in 
arrears on the 21st of January, April, July, and October of each year (subject to Modified 
Following Business Day Convention) (each, a “Payment Date”), in respect of the Interest 
Accrual Period ending immediately prior thereto, in accordance with the applicable Priority of 
Payments, and will be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed and a 
360-day year. 
Notwithstanding the above, the first Payment Date will take place on the 21st of October 2025 
(the “First Payment Date”), and interest will accrue at the corresponding Interest Rate from 
the Disbursement Date (inclusive) to the First Payment Date (exclusive).

4.9.1. 
REDEMPTION PRICE 
The redemption price of the Notes will be ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND EUROS (€ 100,000) per

4.9.2. 
DATE AND FORMS OF REDEMPTION 
The final maturity of the Notes will take place on the date on which they are fully redeemed 
or on the Legal Maturity Date of the Fund, i.e., 21 January 2040, (subject to the Modified

Management Company redeeming the issue of the Notes prior to the Legal Maturity Date of 
the Fund upon the occurrence of an Enforcement Event in accordance with section 4.4.3 of 
the Registration Document. 
The Notes will be redeemed by reducing their nominal value on each Payment Date until their 
full redemption in accordance with the redemption rules set forth below and following the 
Pre-Enforcement Priority of Payments or the Post-Enforcement Priority of Payments set forth 
in section 3.4.7.2 and 3.4.7.3, respectively, of the Additional Information, and provided that 
there are sufficient Available Funds or Post-Enforcement Available Funds, as applicable, for 
such purposes.

Revolving Period: no redemption of the Notes, except as described in section 4.6.3 of 
the Securities Note. 
 
Pro-Rata Redemption Period: the redemption of the Notes will be pari passu and pro-
rata without preference or priority amongst themselves, in accordance with the Pre-
Enforcement Priority of Payments set forth in section 3.4.7.2 of the Additional

In particular, Class F Notes shall be redeemed for an amount equal to the Class F Notes Target 
Amortisation Amount in accordance with the Pre-Enforcement Priority of Payments set forth 
in section 3.4.7.2 of the Additional Information.  
Once Class F Notes are fully redeemed, the subordination of such Class F will no longer apply.

Sequential Redemption Period 
Upon the occurrence of a Subordination Event (other than a Seller´s Call Option), the Class 
A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, and the Class E Notes will 
be redeemed sequentially in accordance with the Pre-Enforcement Priority of Payments set

the exercise of Seller’s Call Options.  
For clarification purposes: 
 
upon the occurrence of any of the events set out in sections (a) to (g) above, 
redemption of the Notes will be made in accordance with the Pre-Enforcement Priority 
of Payments set forth in section 3.4.7.2 of the Additional Information. 
 
Upon the occurrence of the events set out in sections (h) and (i) above, redemption of 
the Notes will be made in accordance with the Post-Enforcement Priority of Payments 
set forth in section 3.4.7.3 of the Additional Information. 
For the purposes of this section: 
“Swap Counterparty Downgrade Event” means the circumstance that the Swap 
Counterparty or its credit support provider pursuant to the Interest Rate Swap Agreement 
(as applicable) ceases to have the initial or subsequent rating threshold foreseen in the 
Interest Rate Swap Agreement. 
“Outstanding Balance” means at any time and with respect to the relevant asset the 
principal amounts due and uncollected together with the principal amounts of the relevant 
asset not yet due. 
“Collateral Trigger” means the ratio as of the previous Interest Payment Date (expressed 
as a percentage) between: 
 
the Outstanding Balance of the Non-Defaulted Receivables; and 
 
the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the Rated Notes.  
Post-Enforcement Priority of Payments 
Upon the occurrence of an Enforcement Event, redemption of the Notes will be sequential in 
accordance with the Post-Enforcement Priority of Payments set out in section 3.4.7.3 of the 
Additional Information as follows:  
 
Class A Notes will rank pari passu and pro rata without preference or priority amongst 
themselves and in priority to the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, 
the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes;  
 
Class B Notes will rank pari passu and pro rata without preference or priority amongst 
themselves and in priority to the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes 
and the Class F Notes, but subordinated to the Class A Notes;  
 
Class C Notes will rank pari passu and pro rata without preference or priority amongst 
themselves and in priority to the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F 
Notes, but subordinated to the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes;  


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 - Securities Note for Wholesale Non-Equity Securities  
Page 89 
 
Class D Notes will rank pari passu and pro rata without preference or priority amongst 
themselves and in priority to the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes, but subordinated 
to the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes and the Class C Notes; 
 
Class E Notes will rank pari passu and pro rata without preference or priority amongst 
themselves and in priority to the Class F Notes, but subordinated to the Class A Notes, 
the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes and the Class D Notes; and 
 
Class F Notes will rank pari passu and pro rata without preference or priority amongst 
themselves. 
Final redemption of the Notes on the Notes Maturity Date 
The Notes Maturity Date and consequently final redemption of the Notes is 21 January 2040 
(subject to Modified Following Business Day Convention) unless the Notes are fully redeemed 
on a prior date. Final redemption of the Notes on the Notes Maturity Date shall be made 
subject to the Post-Enforcement Priority of Payments set forth in section 3.4.7.3 of the 
Additional Information.  
4.10. 
Indication of investor yield and calculation method 
The average yield, duration and final maturity of the Notes depend on several factors, of 
which the most significant are the following: 
 
The schedule for redeeming each of the Loans established in the corresponding Loan 
agreements. 
 
The ability of the Borrowers to totally or partially redeem the Loans in advance and the 
speed with which this redemption takes place during the duration of the Fund. Thus, 
the redemption of the Loans by the Borrowers, subject to ongoing changes, and 
estimated in this Prospectus through the use of several assumptions regarding the 
behaviour of the future CPR, which will directly influence the speed of the redemption 
of the Notes, and, therefore, the average life and duration of the Notes. 
 
The interest rates applicable to the Loans, which will cause the amount to be paid in 
each instalment to vary. 
 
A default by the Borrowers regarding payment of the Loan instalments. 
In order to calculate the tables included in this section, the following hypothetical values, 
taking into consideration the Receivables, have been assumed for the factors described:  
 
Regarding the Receivables:  
(i) 
the weighted average interest rate of the Receivables is 6.70% (weighted 
average interest rate of the Preliminary Portfolio); 
(ii) 
an annual constant default rate (CDR) of 1.60% (annual) with an average 
recovery rate of 23% at twenty-four (24) months. The average recovery rate is 
the proportion of the Outstanding Balance of the Defaulted Receivables 
recovered after twenty-four (24) months. The weighted average rate of 
Defaulted Receivables and the average rate of recoveries are consistent with 
respect the information with the Defaulted Receivables and recoveries data of a 
similar portfolio to the Preliminary Portfolio (see tables in section 2.2.7.3 of the 
Additional Information);  
(iii) 
EURIBOR 3 months was 2.143% on 13 May 2025 and will remain constant. 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 - Securities Note for Wholesale Non-Equity Securities  
Page 90 
 
the Disbursement Date of the Notes is 28 May 2025; 
 
the CPRs (12%, 15% and 18%), which are consistent with the prepayment historical 
data of “SANTANDER CONSUMO 4, F.T.”, “SANTANDER CONSUMO 5, F.T.” and “SANTANDER 
CONSUMO 6, F.T.”, hold constant over the life of the Notes, which are consistent with 
the CPR data of a similar portfolio to the Preliminary Portfolio;  
 
the weighted average interest rate of the Notes on the Disbursement Date is equal to 
3.24% (under the assumption that EURIBOR 3 months was 2.143 % on 13 May 2025) 
and the weighted average spread is 1.10%; 
 
the interest obtained by the Fund Accounts is zero; 
 
estimated annual Ordinary Expenses of the Fund: annual rate of 0.1% on the 
Outstanding Balance of the Receivables, which, during the first year, will correspond 
to an amount equivalent to ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED MILLION EUROS 
(€ 1,500,000,000); 
 
the First Payment Date is 21st October 2025; 
 
there has been no early termination of the Revolving Period;  
 
there has been no Subordination Event; and 
 
there has been no Early Liquidation of the Fund by application of a Tax Change Event 
or Regulatory Change Event but there has been an Early Liquidation of the Fund for a 
Clean-up Call Option (in this regard, there are sufficient Post-Enforcement Available 
Funds to amortise all Classes of Notes on the Payment Date the Clean-up Call Option 
is exercised). 
 
the Fund will acquire Additional Receivables during the Revolving Period in accordance 
with section 2.2.2.3 of the Additional Information. 
The above hypotheses arise from the historical information provided by the Seller and that 
are reasonable for a portfolio of equivalent loans (as defined in Risk Factor 1.1.1 above). If 
we assume that the Management Company, acting on behalf of the Fund, proceeds to the 
Early Liquidation of the Fund, and following the instructions of the Seller, as established by 
section 4.4.3.3(a) of the Registration Document when the Outstanding Balance of the 
Receivables falls below 10% of the Outstanding Balance of the Receivables on the Date of 
Incorporation, the average life, maturity and IRR of the Notes would be the following at for 
CPR of 12%, 15% and 18%, respectively: 
(remainder of page left intentionally blank.)

The Management Company states that the information of the tables included below is for 
informative purposes only and that the amounts reflected therein do not represent a specific 
payment obligation by the Fund to third parties in the referred dates or periods. The data 
included in the tables below has been prepared under the assumption of a repayment rate of 
the Loans on a constant basis during the life of the Fund, subject to constant changes.  
The average life of each class of the Notes are subject to factors largely outside the control 
of the Fund and consequently no assurance can be given that the assumptions and the 
estimates above will prove in any way to be realistic and they must therefore be viewed with 
considerable caution. 
Set forth below are the tables showing the debt service for each Class of Notes for CPR of 
15%, which are consistent with the cash flow model provided by INTEX. For the avoidance of 
doubt, all the tables presented in this section are consistent with the cash flow model provided 
by INTEX. Tables for different scenarios are not included, given that differences in average 
lives are not significant. The results displayed are consistent with the cash flow model 
provided by Bloomberg. 
According to these assumptions, no Class E and Class F Notes Interest Deferral Trigger is 
expected, and (ii) no Revolving Period Early Termination Event is expected.

4.13. 
The issue date of the securities 
Issuance of the Notes shall be effected under the Deed of Incorporation on the Date of

4.13.1. 
GROUP OF POTENTIAL INVESTORS 
The placement of the Notes is aimed at qualified investors as defined in article 2(e) of the 
Prospectus Regulation, i.e., for descriptive purposes and not limited to, legal persons 
authorised or regulated to operate in financial markets, including credit institutions, 
investment services companies, insurance companies, collective investment institutions and 
their management companies, pension funds and their management companies, other 
authorised or regulated financial entities, etc. 
By subscribing the Notes, each Noteholder agrees to the terms of the Deed of Incorporation 
and this Prospectus and is reminded of the EU Due Diligence Requirements. 
4.13.2. 
MIFID II/MIFIR AND PRIIPS 
The new regulatory framework established by MIFID II and by Regulation 600/2013/UE of 
the European Parliament and of Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments 
and amending Regulation (EU) No. 648/2012 (“MIFIR”) has been mainly implemented in 
Spain through Royal Decree 14/2018, of 28 September and Royal Decree 1464/2018, of 21 
December. The potential investors in the Notes must carry out their own analysis on the risks 
and costs which MIFID II/MIFIR or their future technical standards may imply for the 
investment in Notes. 
Therefore, the Notes shall not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail 
investor in the EEA or the United Kingdom. For these purposes, a “retail investor” means a 
person who is one (or more) of: 
 
a retail client as defined in point (11) of article 4(1) of MIFID II; and/or 
 
a customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EC on insurance distribution, 
where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) 
of article 4(1) of MIFID II; and/or 
 
not a “qualified investor” as defined in the Prospectus Regulation. 
Consequently, no key information document (KID) required by EU PRIIPS Regulation for 
offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA 
has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them 
available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. 
For the above purposes, the term “offer” includes communication in any form and by any 
means, of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and on the Notes offered such as 
enables an investor to decide whether to purchase or subscribe for the Notes. 
4.13.3. 
DISBURSEMENT DATE AND FORM 
The “Disbursement Date” will be 28 May 2025. 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 - Securities Note for Wholesale Non-Equity Securities  
Page 97 
The subscription price of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class 
D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes will be at par as provided in section 4.2.2 
of this Securities Note. 
The disbursement of the subscription amounts of the Notes will be made in accordance with 
the Management, Placement and Subscription Agreement. 
On the Disbursement Date: 
 
the subscription price of the Notes placed by the Joint Lead Managers amongst qualified 
investors will be paid to the Fund by the Paying Agent by transfer to the Cash Flow 
Account. Previously, the Noteholders subscribing the Notes placed by the Joint Lead 
Managers would have paid the relevant subscription price prior to 2.00 p.m. CET with 
value date the same date; and 
 
the subscription price of the Notes not placed amongst qualified investors by the Joint 
Lead Managers and subscribed by the Seller will be paid to the Fund by the Paying 
Agent by transfer to the Cash Flow Account with value date the same date. 
4.14. 
Restrictions on free transferability of securities 
The Notes shall be freely transferred by any means allowed by law and in accordance with 
AIAF standards. The ownership of each Note will be transferred by book-entry transfer. The 
registration of the transfer in favour of the acquirer in the book-entry register will have the 
same effects as the transfer (entrega) of the Notes and, as from such time, the transfer may 
be challenged by third parties. 
5. 
ADMISSION TO TRADING AND DEALING ARRANGEMENTS 
5.1. 
Indication of the Market where the securities will be traded 
On the Disbursement Date, the Management Company will request the admission of all the 
Notes issued to trading on the AIAF, which is a regulated market pursuant to article 42.2.a) 
of the Securities Market Act and a regulated market pursuant to article 4.1(21) of MiFID II. 
It is expected that the final admission to trading on AIAF will occur no later than thirty (30) 
days from the Disbursement Date, once the corresponding authorisations have been 
obtained. 
The Management Company, in the name and on behalf of the Fund, confirms that it is aware 
of the requirements and conditions for the listing, maintenance and de-listing of securities 
with AIAF in accordance with applicable regulations as well as the requirements of its 
governing bodies, and the Management Company undertakes to comply with them. 
The Management Company will also, on behalf of the Fund, request the inclusion of the issue 
of the Notes in IBERCLEAR so that clearance and settlement may be carried out under the 
operating rules established (or that may be approved in the future) by IBERCLEAR regarding 
the securities admitted to trading on the AIAF and represented by book-entries. 
In the event of a failure to meet the deadline for admission of the Notes to trading, the 
Management Company undertakes to publish the appropriate insider information (información 
privilegiada) or other relevant information (otra información relevante), as applicable, with 
the CNMV and make the announcement on the EU Securitisation Repository website for the 
purposes of article 7 of the EU Securitisation Regulation and in the Daily Bulletin of the AIAF 
or in any other media generally accepted by the market which guarantees adequate 
dissemination of the information, in time and content, concerning the reasons for such event 
and the new date for admission of the Notes to trading.

Credit ratings assigned to the securities at the request or with the cooperation 
of the issuer in the rating process. A brief explanation of the meaning of the

provisional ratings by the Rating Agencies: 
 
FITCH 
MDBRS 
Class A Notes 
AA 
AA 
Class B Notes 
A

If the provisional credit ratings of the Rated Notes are not confirmed as final by any of the 
Rating Agencies on or prior to the Disbursement Date (and in any case prior to the 
disbursement of the Notes), unless such provisional ratings are upgraded. This circumstance 
will be immediately reported to the CNMV and all counterparties of the Fund (including other 
Rating Agencies) and made public as provided in section 4 of the Additional Information and 
will result in termination of the incorporation of the Fund, the Notes issue and all Transaction 
Documents (except for the Start-Up Expenses Loan Agreement in relation to the expenses of 
incorporation of the Fund and the issue of the Notes), and the assignment of the Receivables. 
7.3.1. 
RATINGS CONSIDERATIONS 
7.3.1.1. 
Ratings 
The meaning of the ratings assigned to the Notes by FITCH and MDBRS can be reviewed at 
those Rating Agencies’ websites: 
 
www.dbrs.morningstar.com; and 
 
www.fitchratings.com. 
The ratings assigned by the Rating Agencies do not constitute an evaluation of the likelihood 
of Borrowers prepaying principal, nor indeed of the extent to which such payments differ from 
what was originally forecasted and should not prevent potential investors from conducting 
their own analysis of the Notes to be acquired. The ratings are not by any means a rating of 
the level of actuarial performance.  


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 - Securities Note for Wholesale Non-Equity Securities  
Page 100 
The abovementioned credit ratings are intended purely as an opinion and should not prevent 
potential investors from conducting their own analyses of the securities to be acquired. 
The Rating Agencies may revise, suspend or withdraw the final ratings assigned at any time, 
based on any information that may come to their notice. Those events, which shall not 
constitute early liquidation events of the Fund, shall forthwith be notified to both the CNMV 
and the Noteholders, in accordance with the provisions of section 4.1 of the Additional 
Information.  
7.3.1.2. 
Registration of Rating Agencies 
 
On 31 October 2011, FITCH was registered and authorised by ESMA as a European 
Union Credit Rating Agency in accordance with the provisions of CRA Regulation. 
 
On 14 December 2018, MDBRS was registered and authorised by ESMA as a European 
Union Credit Rating Agency in accordance with the provisions of the CRA Regulation. 
7.3.1.3. 
Fitch 
Fitch’s ratings of structured finance obligations on the long-term scale consider the 
obligations’ relative vulnerability to default. These ratings are typically assigned to an 
individual security or tranche in a transaction and not to an issuer. 
 
AAA (sf): Highest Credit Quality. ‘AAA’ ratings denote the lowest expectation of 
default risk. They are assigned only in cases of exceptionally strong capacity for 
payment of financial commitments. This capacity is highly unlikely to be adversely 
affected by foreseeable events. 
 
AA (sf): Very High Credit Quality. ‘AA’ ratings denote expectations of very low default 
risk. They indicate very strong capacity for payment of financial commitments. This 
capacity is not significantly vulnerable to foreseeable events. 
 
A (sf): High Credit Quality. ‘A’ ratings denote expectations of low default risk. The 
capacity for payment of financial commitments is considered strong. This capacity may, 
nevertheless, be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic conditions than is 
the case for higher ratings. 
 
BBB (sf): Good Credit Quality. ‘BBB’ ratings indicate that expectations of default risk 
are currently low. The capacity for payment of financial commitments is considered 
adequate, but adverse business or economic conditions are more likely to impair this 
capacity. 
 
BB (sf): Speculative. ‘BB’ ratings indicate an elevated vulnerability to default risk, 
particularly in the event of adverse changes in business or economic conditions over 
time. 
 
B (sf): Highly Speculative. ‘B’ ratings indicate that material default risk is present, but 
a limited margin of safety remains. Financial commitments are currently being met; 
however, capacity for continued payment is vulnerable to deterioration in the business 
and economic environment. 
Within rating categories, Fitch may use modifiers. The modifiers “+” or “-” may be appended 
to a rating to denote relative status within major rating categories. Such suffixes are not 
added to ‘AAA’ ratings and ratings below the ‘CCC’ category. 
Where a rating is referred to as “expected,” alternatively referred to as “expects to rate,” 
it will have a suffix as (EXP). This indicates that the assigned rating may be sensitive to 
(i) finalisation of the terms in the draft documents or (ii) fulfilment of other contingencies 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 - Securities Note for Wholesale Non-Equity Securities  
Page 101 
at closing. For example, expected ratings can be assigned based on the agency’s 
expectations regarding final documentation, typically based on a review of the draft 
documentation provided by the issuer. When final documentation is received, the (EXP) 
suffix typically will be removed and the rating updated if necessary. 
7.3.1.4. 
MDBRS 
The MDBRS long-term rating scale provides an opinion on the risk of default. That is, the 
risk that an issuer will fail to satisfy its financial obligations in accordance with the terms 
under which an obligation has been issued. All rating categories other than AAA and D 
also contain subcategories “(high)” and “(low)”. The absence of either a “(high)” and 
“(low)” designation indicates the rating is in middle of the category. Descriptions on the 
meaning of each individual relevant rating are as follows: 
 
AAA (sf): Highest credit quality. The capacity for the payment of financial obligations 
is exceptionally high and unlikely to be adversely affected by future events. 
 
AA (sf): Superior credit quality. The capacity for the payment of financial obligations 
is considered high. Credit quality differs from AAA only to a small degree. Unlikely to 
be significantly vulnerable to future events. 
 
A (sf): Good Credit quality. The capacity for the payment of financial obligations is 
substantial, but of lesser credit quality than AA. May be vulnerable to future events, 
but qualifying negative factors are considered manageable. 
 
BBB (sf): Adequate credit quality. The capacity for the payment of financial obligations 
is considered acceptable. May be vulnerable to future events. 
 
BB (sf): Speculative, non-investment-grade credit quality. The capacity for the 
payment of financial obligations is uncertain. Vulnerable to future events. 
 
B (sf): Highly speculative credit quality. There is a high level of uncertainty as to the 
capacity to meet financial obligations. 
 
CCC / CC / C (sf): Very highly speculative credit quality. In danger of defaulting on 
financial obligations. There is little difference between these three categories, although 
CC and C ratings are normally applied to obligations that are seen as highly likely to 
default, or subordinated to obligations rated in the CCC to B range. Obligations in 
respect of which default has not technically taken place but is considered inevitable 
may be rated in the C category. 
 
D (sf): When the issuer has filed under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or 
winding up statute or there is a failure to satisfy an obligation after the exhaustion of 
grace periods, a downgrade to D may occur. MDBRS may also use SD (Selective 
Default) in cases where only some securities are impacted, such as the case of a 
“distressed exchange”. 
7.3.1.5. 
Final rating considerations 
The Rating Agencies differentiates structured finance ratings from fundamental ratings (i.e., 
ratings on nonfinancial corporate, financial institution, and public sector entities) on the long-
term scale by adding the suffix (sf) to the structured finance ratings.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO BE INCLUDED IN RELATION TO ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES 
(Annex 19 of the Prospectus Delegated Regulation) 
_______________________ 
 
1. 
THE SECURITIES 
1.1. 
A statement that a notification has been, or is intended to be communicated to 
ESMA, as regards simple, transparent and standardised securitisation (STS) 
compliance, where applicable 
The securitisation transaction described in this Prospectus is intended to qualify as a simple, 
transparent and standardised securitisation (STS securitisation) within the meaning of article 
18 of the EU Securitisation Regulation. Consequently, on or about the Date of Incorporation 
(and in any case within fifteen (15) calendar days from the Date of Incorporation), Banco 
Santander, as Originator, will submit the STS Notification to ESMA Register of STS 
notifications in accordance with article 27 of the EU Securitisation Regulation, pursuant to 
which compliance with the requirements of articles 19 to 22 of the EU Securitisation 
Regulation shall be notified to the ESMA register of STS notifications in order to request that 
the securitisation transaction described in this Prospectus is included in the ESMA Register of 
STS notifications for the purposes of article 27(5) of the EU Securitisation Regulation.  
The Originator shall notify Bank of Spain in its capacity as competent authority of the 
submission of such mandatory STS Notification to ESMA, attaching such notification.  
1.2. 
STS compliance 
None of the Management Company, on behalf of the Fund, the Seller (in its capacity as 
originator), the Arranger, the Joint Lead Managers or any other party to the Transaction 
Documents gives any explicit or implied representation or warranty as to (i) the inclusion of 
this securitisation transaction in the list administered by ESMA within the meaning of article 
27(5) of the EU Securitisation Regulation, (ii) whether this securitisation transaction shall be 
recognised or designated as ‘STS’ or ‘simple, transparent and standardised’ within the 
meaning of article 18 of the EU Securitisation Regulation after the date of notification to 
ESMA, and (iii) whether the securitisation transaction does or will continue to meet the “STS” 
requirements or to qualify as an STS-securitisation under the EU Securitisation Regulation or 
pursuant to article 12(3) of the UK’s Securitisation Regulations 2024 (as amended) as at the 
date of this Prospectus or at any point in time in the future.  
The status of the STS Notification is not static and investors should conduct their own research 
regarding 
the 
status 
of 
the 
STS 
Notification 
on 
the 
ESMA 
website 
(https://www.esma.europa.eu/policy-activities/securitisation/simple-transparent-
andstandardised-sts-securitisation). 
The Seller, as originator, shall be responsible for the fulfilment of the requirements of articles 
19 to 22 of the EU Securitisation Regulation and shall immediately notify ESMA and inform 
its competent authority when the transaction no longer meets the requirements of articles 19 
to 22 of the EU Securitisation Regulation. 
Prospective investors are themselves responsible for analysing their own regulatory position, 
and should consult their own advisers in this respect and should consider (and where 
appropriate, take independent advice on) the consequence from a regulatory perspective of 
the transaction not being considered an STS securitisation, including (but not limited to) that 
the lack of such designation may negatively affect the regulatory position of, and the capital 
charges on, the Notes and, in addition, have a negative effect on the price and liquidity of the 
Notes in the secondary market. 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 – Additional Information 
Page 103 
1.3. 
Third-party verification 
The Seller, as originator, has used the services of PCS, as a Third-Party Verification Agent 
(STS) in connection with an assessment of the STS Verification. It is expected that the STS 
Verification prepared by PCS: 
(a) 
will be issued on or prior to the Disbursement Date, and 
(b) 
will be available for investors on the PCS website (https://www.pcsmarket.org/sts-
verification-transactions/) together with a detailed explanation of its scope at 
https://www.pcsmarket.org/disclaimer.  
The STS Verification is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, is not investment 
advice whether generally or as defined under DIRECTIVE 2014/65/EU (MiFID II) and is not a 
credit rating whether generally or as defined under the CRA Regulation or Section 3(a) of the 
United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (as amended from time to time, the 
“Exchange Act”). PCS is not an “expert” as defined in the United States Securities Act. 
There can be no assurance that the securitisation transaction described in this Prospectus will 
receive the STS Verification and if the securitisation transaction described in this Prospectus 
does not receive the STS Verification, this shall not, under any circumstances, affect the 
liability of the Seller and the Fund in respect of its legal obligations under the EU Securitisation 
Regulation, nor shall it affect the obligations imposed on institutional investors as set out in 
article 5 of the EU Securitisation Regulation. Having said that, since PCS has prepared draft 
versions of the STS Verification during the process leading to registration of this Prospectus, 
it is expected that the final STS Verification will be positive. 
Investors should conduct their own research regarding the nature of the STS Verification and 
must read the information available in http://pcsmarket.org. In the provision of STS 
Verification, PCS bases its decision on information provided directly and indirectly by the 
Seller (as originator). For the avoidance of doubt, the PCS website and the contents thereof 
do not form part of this Prospectus. 
1.4. 
The minimum denomination of an issue 
Each of the Notes issued by the Fund will have a nominal value of ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
EUROS (€ 100,000). 
The Fund, which is represented by the Management Company, will be incorporated with the 
Initial Receivables assigned by the Seller to the Fund on the Date of Incorporation, the 
Outstanding Balance of those Receivables will be equal to or slightly higher than ONE 
THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED MILLION EUROS (€1,500,000,000), which represents the nominal 
value of the issue of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D 
Notes, and the Class E Notes.  
For clarification purposes, as the Receivables represent ninety-five per cent (95%) of any and 
all of the receivables arising from the Loans (as of the Date of Incorporation in connection 
with the Initial Receivables and as of the relevant Purchase Date in connection with the 
Additional Receivables), the total aggregate Outstanding Balance of the Loans as of 
Disbursement Date will be approximately €1,578,947,368.42. 
The Fund shall issue the Class F Notes with an aggregate nominal value of TWENTY-TWO 
MILLION FIVE HUNDRED EUROS (€ 22,500,000), which will be deposited in the Cash Flow 
Account and used to fund the Reserve Fund in an amount equal to the Initial Reserve Fund.

1.5. 
Confirmation that the information relating to an undertaking/obligor not 
involved in the issue has been accurately reproduced from the information 
published by the undertaking/obligor 
Not applicable. 
2. 
THE UNDERLYING ASSETS 
2.1. 
Confirmation that the securitised assets backing the issue have characteristics 
that demonstrate the capacity to produce funds to service any payments due and 
payable on the securities 
The Seller confirms that the flows of principal, ordinary interest and any other amounts 
generated by the Receivables are sufficient to meet the payments due and payable under the 
Notes (taking into account the subordination that exists between the different classes of 
Notes) in accordance with the contractual nature thereof. 
However, in order to cover any eventual payment defaults of the Borrowers, credit 
enhancements will be put in place in order to increase the security or regularity of the 
payments of the Notes and mitigate or neutralise differences in interest rates on the Loans, 
and which are described in section 3.4.2 of this Additional Information. Such enhancements, 
however, may prove to be insufficient in exceptional circumstances.  
The Notes have different risk of failing to receive payments as and when due and therefore 
the Rated Notes have different credit ratings assigned by the Rating Agencies as detailed in 
section 7.3.2 of the Securities Note. 
2.2. 
Assets backing the issue 
Receivables 
The Fund will pool in its assets the Receivables arising from Loans granted by the Seller to 
the Borrowers for consumer financing, without limitation, debtor´s expenditures (including 
small consumer expenditures and other non-defined expenditures), the purchase of consumer 
goods in its broadest sense (including finishing home working construction), the purchase of 
goods (including the acquisition of new and used vehicle or services). For clarification 
purposes, the Receivables shall represent ninety-five per cent (95%) of the receivables 
arising from the Loans (as of the Date of Incorporation in connection with the Initial 
Receivables and as of the relevant Purchase Date in connection with the Additional 
Receivables). 
The requirements to be met by the Receivables to be assigned to the Fund and their 
characteristics are described in the sections below and in the Deed of Incorporation. 
Additional information can be found below regarding the following: 
 
Maximum Receivables Amount; and 
 
Enforcement proceedings. 
Maximum Receivables Amount 
The maximum amount of the Outstanding Balance of the Receivables pooled in the Fund will 
be equal to or slightly higher than ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED MILLION EUROS 
(€1,500,000,000) (the “Maximum Receivables Amount”), equivalent to the aggregate 
nominal value of the issue of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the 
Class D Notes, and the Class E Notes.  


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 – Additional Information 
Page 105 
Additional Information on enforcement proceedings 
Since the Loan agreements have not been formalised as a public document but as a private 
document, the Servicer will have to commence declarative proceedings for the recognition of 
the amounts that are due and payable under the Loan agreements in order to subsequently 
be able to commence enforcement action of the potential ruling against the assets of the 
Borrower. 
2.2.1. 
LEGAL JURISDICTION BY WHICH THE POOL ASSETS IS GOVERNED 
The Receivables and the Loans are governed by the Spanish laws. In particular, the 
securitised Receivables are governed by the Spanish banking regulations and, specifically and 
where applicable, by: 
 
Law 16/2011, of 24 June, on consumer credit agreements;  
 
Circular 8/1990 of Bank of Spain, of 7 September, on transparency of transactions and 
protection of customers; 
 
Order EHA/2899/2011, of 28 October, on transparency and protection for customers 
of banking services;  
 
Circular 5/2012, of 27 June, of Bank of Spain, for credit entities and providers of 
payment services, on transparency of banking services and responsible granting of

the General Law for the Defence of Consumers and Users and other complementary 
laws (Real Decreto Legislativo 1/2007, de 16 de noviembre, por el que se aprueba el 
texto refundido de la Ley General para la Defensa de los Consumidores y Usuarios y 
otras leyes complementarias) (as amended, the “Consumer Protection Law”); and  
 
Law 7/1998, of 13 April, on General Contracting Conditions (“Law 7/1998”).  
2.2.2. 
GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE BORROWERS, RECEIVABLES AND THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, AS 
WELL AS ANY GLOBAL STATISTICAL DATA REFERRED TO THE SECURITISED ASSETS 
2.2.2.1. 
Assignment of the Initial Receivables 
The total Outstanding Balance of the Receivables to be assigned to the Fund on the Date of 
Incorporation will be equal to the Maximum Receivables Amount, i.e., ONE THOUSAND FIVE 
HUNDRED MILLION EUROS (€ 1,500,000,000) or an amount slightly higher and as close as 
possible to that amount. 
The assignment of the Initial Receivables will be effective from the Date of Incorporation and 
will be documented by means of the Master Sale and Purchase Agreement (as a notarial deed 
(póliza)) (which will include a list of the Receivables assigned to the Fund), executed 
simultaneously with the Deed of Incorporation and upon incorporation of the Fund. 
In order for the Initial Receivables to be assigned to, and acquired by, the Fund, each Initial 
Receivable shall, on the Date of Incorporation, individually satisfy all the representations and 
warranties established in section 2.2.8.5 below (the “Individual Eligibility Criteria”). 
Any Receivables (either the Initial Receivables or the Additional Receivables) to be offered by 
the Seller to the Fund will be existing eligible receivables held by the Seller on the Date of 
Incorporation (in respect of the Initial Receivables) or on a Purchase Date (in respect of the 
Additional Receivables), will be randomly selected (in the case of the Initial Receivables, from 
the Preliminary Portfolio) and shall meet the relevant Eligibility Criteria (as applicable), as set 
forth (i) in section 2.2.8.5 (sub-section “Assignment of the Initial Receivables”) above (in 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 – Additional Information 
Page 106 
respect of the Initial Receivables); and (ii) in section 2.2.2.3.2 of the Additional Information 
(in respect of the Additional Receivables). 
Such assignment will be made in the terms described in section 3.3.1 et seq. of the Additional 
Information. 
Selection of Initial Receivables from the Preliminary Portfolio 
Any Initial Receivables to be offered by the Seller to the Fund will be existing eligible

the Preliminary Portfolio and each Initial Receivable shall, on the Date of Incorporation, satisfy 
individually satisfy the representations and warranties established in section 2.2.8.5 below.  
The preliminary loan portfolio from which the Initial Receivables shall be selected comprises 
206,469 Loans (the “Preliminary Portfolio”), with an Outstanding Balance as of 11 March 
2025 (the “Cut-Off Date”) amounting to € 2,068,372,012. 
None of the Loans are secured by personal guarantees (i.e., avales/fianzas) granted by third 
parties (avalistas) or in-rem security interests (derechos reales), although such Loans could 
benefit from third-party guarantees at any time in the future. 
Review of the selected assets securitised through the Fund upon being established 
Deloitte has reviewed a sample of 461 Loans randomly selected out of the Preliminary 
Portfolio from which the Receivables shall be selected. 
The results, applying a confidence level of at least 99%, are set out in a special securitisation 
report prepared by Deloitte for the purposes of complying with article 22.2 of the EU 
Securitisation Regulation. The Seller, as originator, confirms that no significant adverse 
findings have been detected. 
Additionally, Deloitte has verified the data disclosed in the stratification tables set out in 
section 2.2.2.2 below in respect of the Preliminary Portfolio.  
The Management Company has requested from the CNMV the exemption to submitting the 
special securitisation report according to the second paragraph of article 22.1 c) of Law 
5/2015. 
None of the Fund, the Management Company, the Arranger, the Joint Lead Managers, the 
Paying Agent or any other party to the Transaction Documents other than the Seller has 
undertaken or will undertake any investigation, search or other action to verify the details of 
the Receivables and the Loan agreements or to establish the creditworthiness of the 
Borrowers.

The interest rates of the Receivables shown in the above table have taken into account 
any penalty that is applied to any Receivable. In particular, the application of penalty 
on interest rates is limited to 12.83% of the Loans of the Preliminary Portfolio 
(equivalent to 11.37% of the Outstanding Balance). This 11.37% of the Outstanding 
Balance of the Loans with penalty is subject to annual review. In any case, the Loans 
with penalty is not subject to increase. On the other hand, the remaining 88.63% of 
the Outstanding Balance of the Loans will be subject to no penalty.

The purpose “Other” reflects any consumer good or service not specified in any of the 
categories described above (there is no more specific data) and represents 53.38% of 
the Outstanding Balance of the Receivables. Within this concept, the following purposes 
are included: “equipment”, “medical expenses”, “travel”, “tuition” and, most 
frequently, “other/miscellaneous”. Within “other/miscellaneous”, the Seller does not 
record the purpose of those Loans – there is no more specific purpose.  
For pre-approved Loans, there is not necessarily a purpose as those Loans are pre-
approved by the Seller, and therefore, the purpose is not relevant. Regarding the pre-
approved Loans, which amount to 87.77% of the Loans, and 86.27% of the 
Outstanding Balance of the Receivables, the origination policy described in section 
2.2.7 of this Additional Information has not been softened. 
Equally, for those Loans that are not pre-approved, on many occasions the borrowers 
do not specify the purpose for the Loan, so therefore the purpose recorded by the 
branch is “others or miscellaneous”. There are no referral groups of good and/or 
services (grupos prescriptores) that link financing to such good or service (e.g., health 
centres, master schools, private universities, etc.).

“Regulatory PD” means the probability of a borrower being unable to meet its 
payments obligations under the Loans over one-year period as stated in article 163 of 
CRR. Banco Santander, as calculation agent of the Regulatory PD, will update the 
Regulatory PD of every Loan in the following two cases; (i) monthly, taking into account 
the own economic variables borne by the borrower, and (ii) yearly, as the model that 
supports the Regulatory PD’s outcome has to be calibrated. 
Note that the representation (29) in section 2.2.8.5 of the Additional Information, each 
Loan should have a Regulatory PD equal to or less than 6 per cent (6)%

pooled in the Fund up to a maximum amount equal to the Principal Target Redemption 
Amount on the Determination Date preceding the relevant Purchase Date, provided that 
the Seller has sufficient Additional Receivables to be assigned to the Fund meeting the 
Eligibility Criteria on such assignment date. 
Additional Receivables will be assigned to the Fund by means of purchase offers and their 
acceptance by the Fund, in compliance with the provisions of section 2.2.2.3.3. of the 
Additional Information of the Prospectus and the Deed of Incorporation. 
Any expenses and taxes resulting from the formalisation of successive assignments will 
be borne by the Seller.

as provided in section 3.3.3.2 of the Additional Information. 
2.2.2.3.2. 
Eligibility Criteria 
In order for the Additional Receivables to be assigned to, and acquired by, the Fund, both the 
Individual Eligibility Criteria and the Global Eligibility Criteria (the “Eligibility Criteria”) set 
forth below must be satisfied on the relevant Purchase Date. 
Individual Eligibility Criteria 
Each Additional Receivable shall, on the relevant Purchase Date, individually satisfy all the 
representations and warranties established in section 2.2.8.5 below. 
Global Eligibility Criteria 
In addition to the Individual Eligibility Criteria, in order for the Additional Receivables to be 
assigned to the Fund as a whole (assuming for these purposes that the relevant Additional 
Receivables to be purchased on the relevant Purchase Date have been assigned to the Fund), 
the following global eligibility criteria must be satisfied on the relevant Purchase Date (the 
“Global Eligibility Criteria”): 
 
That the aggregate Outstanding Balance of the Receivables corresponding to the same 
Borrower does not exceed 0.05% of the total Outstanding Balance of the Receivables. 
 
That the weighted average remaining term of the Receivables, weighted by the 
Outstanding Balance of the Receivables, does not exceed eighty-four (84) months. 
 
That the aggregate Outstanding Balance of the Receivables corresponding to the 
autonomous community with the highest concentration does not exceed 26% of the 
total Outstanding Balance of the Receivables.  
 
That the Outstanding Balance of the Receivables corresponding to the three 
autonomous communities with the highest concentration does not exceed 65% of the 
total Outstanding Balance of the Receivables.  
 
That the weighted average interest rate of the Receivables weighted by the 
Outstanding Balance of the Receivables is not lower than 6.5%.  
 
That the aggregate Outstanding Balance of the Receivables higher than € 60,000 does 
not exceed 5% of the aggregate Outstanding Balance of the Receivables.

includes both Initial Receivables and Additional Receivables). 
2.2.2.3.3. 
Procedure for the acquisition of Additional Receivables 
The assignment of the Additional Receivables will take place in accordance with the following 
terms, the provisions set out in the Master Sale and Purchase Agreement and the provisions 
set out in the Deed of Incorporation: 
 
On each Offer Request Date, the Management Company will request the Seller the 
assignment of Additional Receivables to the Fund, specifying (i) the Available Funds on 
the Determination Date preceding the relevant Payment Date and (ii) the Payment 
Date on which the assignment to the Fund and payment of the purchase price of the 
assignment must be made. 
Before 17.00 CET on the Offer Date, the Seller will offer to the Management Company 
the assignment of the Additional Receivables included in the assignment offer, which 
must meet the Eligibility Criteria, along with a data file detailing the selected Loans 
and their characteristics. 
No later than on the fifth (5th) Business Day preceding the relevant Payment Date (the 
“Purchase Date”), the Management Company will communicate the Seller the 
acceptance of the assignment of all or part of the Additional Receivables, along with a 
data file with the details of the Additional Receivables accepted and their 
characteristics, as reported by the Seller. 
In determining which Additional Receivables are to be included in the assignment 
acceptance, the Management Company will: 
(i) check that the Receivables (and the Loans from which they are arising) listed on 
the assignment offer meet the Eligibility Criteria (i.e., the Individual Eligibility 
Criteria in connection with the Additional Receivables, and the Global Eligibility 
Criteria in connection with the Receivables) in accordance with the characteristics 
notified by the Seller; and  
(ii) determine the Additional Receivables that are acceptable and eligible for 
assignment to the Fund for an amount not exceeding the Acquisition Amount. 
For these purposes, “Acquisition Amount” means an amount equal to the sum of the 
95% of the Outstanding Balance of the Additional Receivables pooled in the Fund on 
the Purchase Date. 
 
The assignment of the Additional Receivables will be full and unconditional from the 
relevant Purchase Date and will be made for the entire remaining term until the total 
maturity of the Receivables, in accordance with section 3.3.2 of this Additional 
Information. 
For the purposes of this section: 
“Offer Request Date” means the date corresponding to the eighth (8th) Business Day 
preceding each Payment Date during the Revolving Period on which the Management 
Company will request the Seller the assignment of Additional Receivables to the Fund. 
“Offer Date” means the date corresponding to the sixth (6th) Business Day preceding each 
Payment Date during the Revolving Period on which the Seller will offer to the Management 
Company the assignment of the Additional Receivables included in the assignment offer.

2.2.3. 
LEGAL NATURE OF THE ASSETS 
The Receivables securitised by means of their assignment to the Fund are credit rights arising 
from Loans granted by the Seller to Borrowers for the financing of, among others, debtor’s 
expenditures (including small consumer expenditures and other non-defined expenditures), 
the purchase of consumer goods in its broadest sense (including finishing home working 
construction), or the purchase of goods (including the acquisition of new and used vehicle or 
services), which have been granted pursuant to, Law 16/2011 (and in respect to the 
Additional Receivables, pursuant to Law 16/2011 and/or any other relevant regulations 
applicable from time to time).  
The Receivables will be directly assigned to the Fund, upon being sold by the Seller and 
acquired by the Fund, on the terms provided for in section 3.3 of this Additional Information. 
The assignment of the Receivables is governed by Spanish common law (ley española 
común), i.e., articles 1,526 et seq. of the Spanish Civil Code and articles 347 and 348 of the 
Spanish Commercial Code. 
2.2.4. 
EXPIRATION OR MATURITY DATE(S) OF ASSETS 
Each of the selected Loans matures in accordance with its particular terms and conditions, as 
set out in the relevant Loan agreement, without prejudice to the partial periodic repayment 
instalments. 
The Borrowers may prepay all or any part of the outstanding balance of the Receivables 
arising from the Loans at any time during the term of the Loans, ceasing as from the date of 
repayment the accrual of interest on the prepaid portion as from the repayment date. 
The maturity date of any Receivable will be in no event later than the Payment Date 
corresponding to January 2038 (the “Final Maturity Date”). 
2.2.5. 
AMOUNT OF THE RECEIVABLES 
The Receivables assigned by the Seller to the Fund will have an amount equal to or slightly 
higher than ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED MILLION EUROS (€1,500,000,000) equivalent 
to the nominal value of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D 
Notes and the Class E Notes. 
The information about the Preliminary Portfolio from which the Initial Receivables to be 
assigned on the Date of Incorporation is located in section 2.2.2 of this Additional Information. 
No Loans in arrears will be assigned to the Fund. 
2.2.6. 
LOAN TO VALUE RATIO OR LEVEL OF COLLATERALISATION 
The Loans of the Preliminary Portfolio have no real estate mortgage security (garantía 
hipotecaria); therefore, the information concerning the ratio of the outstanding balance as 
regards the appraisal value does not apply. 
2.2.7. 
THE METHOD OF ORIGINATION OR CREATION OF ASSETS, AND FOR LOANS AND CREDIT AGREEMENTS, THE 
PRINCIPAL LENDING CRITERIA AND AN INDICATION OF ANY LOANS WHICH DO NOT MEET THESE CRITERIA 
AND ANY RIGHTS OR OBLIGATIONS TO MAKE FURTHER ADVANCES 
The Loans of the Preliminary Portfolio originated in 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025 have 
been granted by the Seller according to its usual procedures of analysis and assessment of 
the credit risk regarding the granting of loans to individuals for consumer purposes (“Banco 
Santander Policies”) which are described herein, representing a total of 99.5% of the 
Outstanding Balance of the Receivables. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the rest of the Loans, 
representing a total of 0.5% of the Outstanding Balance of the Receivables, corresponding to 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 – Additional Information 
Page 117 
Loans granted in 2020, have followed risk policies that do not differ substantially from the 
Banco Santander Policies described herein. 
The Additional Receivables to be assigned to the Fund will be granted in accordance with the 
Banco Santander Policies described in this section. 
The Seller undertakes to disclose to the Management Company without delay any material 
change in Banco Santander Policies and to the Noteholders and potential investors. Any 
material changes in the underwriting standards after the date of this Prospectus that affects 
the Additional Receivables will be fully disclosed without delay to investors and potential 
investors, as an extraordinary notice, pursuant to section 4.2.2 of the Additional Information. 
Additionally, if the credit granting policy set forth in section 2.2.7 of the Additional Information 
is materially modified, it would constitute a Revolving Period Early Termination Event.  
There are no referral groups of good and/or services (grupos prescriptores) that link financing 
to such good or service (e.g., health centres, master schools, private universities, etc.). 
For the purpose of compliance with the requirements stemming from article 243 of the CRR, 
at the time of their inclusion in the Fund, the underlying exposures meet the conditions for 
being assigned under the standardised approach and considering any eligible credit risk 
mitigation a risk weight equal to seventy-five (75) per cent. on an individual exposure basis. 
Considerations on pre-approved Loans 
This sub-section summarises the key points in the origination process of the pre-approved 
Loans. A bimonthly selection of pre-approved clients is undertaken with the last available 
information, at the end of the preceding month by means of a number of policies and using 
a behaviour score and an individualised limit computed on the basis of the payment ability of 
the client. All the necessary data to calculate the eligibility and limits is automatically retrieved 
and no documentation is requested from the client. 
Generally, the limit for the initial amount of Outstanding Balance for pre-approved Loans is 
between €60,000 and €100,000, and therefore, any Loan above that limit requires the manual 
approval from a risk analyst. Also, the specific limit for pre-approved Loans in the digital 
platform is €50,000. 
Within the applied policies to determine whether the client is eligible under a pre-approved 
loan campaign, the following are applied, amongst others:  
(i) 
clients with current default with Banco Santander; 
(ii) 
default historical data in Banco Santander; 
(iii) 
client in unemployment status; 
(iv) 
negative reports from bureaus over EUR 150 for banking financial debt, and over EUR 
500 for other debts (tele-communications companies, electrical companies, etc);  
(v) 
default in CIRBE;  
(vi) 
restructured client;  
(vii) 
client working for a company or group under economic problems; and 
(viii) low credit quality or insufficient ability to pay under a behaviour score;  
If the client fails to meet any of the criteria mentioned in (i) to (viii) above, the client will no 
longer be eligible for a pre-approved loan. As for the admission of non-pre-approved loans, 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 – Additional Information 
Page 118 
apart from these criteria, the client and the operation must go through a scoring model where 
other variables are considered. 
Regarding the debtor situation, the internal assessment on clients in unemployment status is 
made by means of inflows from INEM (governmental unemployment agency). 
As per the limit for the pre-approved Loan, the computing system contains a logic to consider 
the different weightings for recurring inflows and those that are less recurrent. 
The whole client expenses are taken into consideration, adjusted by its recurring nature, in 
order to compute an indebtedness capacity of the client, which is then used in order to allocate 
the relevant limit for the pre-approved Loan. 
Finally, in regards the process of granting the pre-approved loan once the client has applied 
for the pre-approved loan, a real-time assessment is made by the risk system under which 
the granting policy is again verified—and in the event that any element has changed and the 
solvency situation of the debtor does not match with the required situation by Banco 
Santander, the application is denied. The communications sent by Banco Santander to the 
clients in connection with the pre-approved limit, there is a reference to the right of Banco 
Santander to deny the application in the event that the solvency situation has changed or 
there are records in the credit bureaus (new or existing, but Banco Santander could not use 
at a prior time in order to generate the commercial offer of the pre-approved Loan because 
of the application of data privacy regulations). 
Consideration on recoveries 
Generally, a judicial claim will be filed for Loans above EUR 2,000. The suit is made by means 
of the legal proceedings foreseen for each type of agreements, i.e., with or without an 
enforceable title (título ejecutivo). The average terms for the dispatch of enforcement is seven 
(7) months considering that the loans are documented on a private document. 
In the event of filing a declarative proceeding, the average term for the dispatch of 
enforcement is twelve to eighteen (12 to 18) months – nevertheless such proceeding is 
residually used.  
As per the type of debt, the average recovery terms are the following: (i) 1 to 2 years for 
unsecured debt, and (ii) 4 to 5 years for secured debt (especially when a judicial process is 
already ongoing with a particular debtor).  
Finally, the following summarises the weighting of each recovery method in connection with 
the recovered amounts during the last twelve months: 
 
award (adjudicación): 0.1%. 
 
settlement (dación en pago): 0.4%. 
 
cash settlement (efectivo): 96.6%. 
 
refinancing: 3.0%. 
2.2.7.1. 
Risk policies, methods and procedures in the review and approval of loans and credit 
facilities 
Banco Santander’s internal rules contain certain policies, methods and procedures for the 
review and approval of financing transactions approved by the delegated risk committee.  
Approval of the risk is a pre-requisite for entering into any risk transaction with a customer. 
The approval of risk transactions with customers is a limit on customer credit risk, approved 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 – Additional Information 
Page 119 
at the corresponding level according to delegated powers, which takes into account the credit 
quality of the risk party or parties, the maximum amount of the transaction or facility, the 
maximum term of the operation, the additional security contemplated therein, the yield and 
other requirements that have been reviewed in order to approve the transaction. 
The system for proposing risk transactions is part of the process for establishing counterparty 
risk limits. Risk transaction proposals are used by Banco Santander’s business units and 
commercial branch offices in Spain to process any type of requests for risk transactions with 
customers for review and decision-making. 
The review of credit risk consists of analysing the customer’s ability to meet its contractual 
commitments to the Seller and other creditors, thus including an analysis of the customer’s 
credit quality, the risk transactions, any security provided, and the return to be obtained in 
line with the risk assumed. 
Risk is reviewed and classified by applying previously defined methods or models in line with 
the risk segments identified by Banco Santander. 
The risk analysis first takes place via automated assessment systems or decision-making 
support systems. In those cases, in which an automatic decision does not occur, an analysis 
is subsequently performed by the Retailer Acceptance Unit (Unidad de Admisión Manual) 
(UAM), whose risk analysts engage in reviews at the customer/transaction level. 
The risk reviews or analyses require sufficient, up-to-date, comparative and reliable 
information to permit knowledge of the actual situation of each customer, their customary 
sources of income and short- and long-term forecasts. The quantitative and qualitative 
information to be analysed with respect to a customer depends on the risk type or segment 
and on the purpose of the transaction, among other things, and will be different in each case. 
Both the commercial manager and the risk analyst must be aware of and use such 
information. 
The risk review should be performed each time a new customer/transaction is submitted or 
with a pre-established frequency, depending on the segment involved. 
Banco Santander applies internal, responsible and prudent criteria in risk reviews for 
providing financing, which include the following: 
 
1. 
Acceptance of the customer and finance-worthy activities, in accordance with fraud 
and money laundering and terrorism financing prevention policies, and with the 
Global Social and Environmental Responsibility Policy. Customers that have been 
“filtered” through money laundering and terrorism financing prevention cannot 
engage in transactions within the Seller.  
2. 
Portfolio risk: Specific restrictions and/or conditions that feature in the planning of 
the corresponding credit portfolio shall be observed, and any concentration limits that 
may have been established must particularly be taken into account. In this regard, 
the commercial Strategic Programmes that annually determine the risk planning, 
criteria and policies to apply to such portfolios are of particular importance in 
standardised risk portfolios.  
3. 
Customer risk: Review and classification of the customer, carried out in accordance 
with the corresponding model, must primarily allow for an evaluation of:  
o 
The ability of the customer to comply with the financial obligations assumed in 
due time and form.  
o 
The payment history and willingness to comply with its obligations to the Seller 
and to other institutions during the term of the transactions.  


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 – Additional Information 
Page 120 
In accordance with applicable law, Banco Santander does not apply any discriminatory policies 
in decision-making on risk transactions. 
The main criteria that form part of the decision-making process in this phase are: 
a) 
Personal details of parties 
a.1) 
Residency of the risk party or parties 
The Seller’s policy on this criterion distinguishes between those customers 
who are resident in Spain and non-residents, both verified and non-verified. 
a.2) 
Age 
The general criterion for acceptance provides that the age of the party or any 
of the parties shall be between 18 and 80 years (both inclusive), without 
guarantors. Transactions are not approved if one of the parties is below 18 
years of age without guarantors. 
This criterion applies to all products, with the exception of credit cards for 
which it is required that the party be above 18 years of age. 
b) 
The payment capacity of the risk transaction party or parties 
This criterion takes into account proven income by the risk parties, customary 
expenses and the theoretical rate of the loan. In addition, a minimum balance is 
required to cover ordinary expenses. This allows for knowledge of customers’ 
payment capacity in order to meet the financial obligations assumed, according to 
their main sources of income generation, without relying on guarantors, sureties or 
assets offered as security, which must always be considered a secondary and 
exceptional route of recovery. 
In no case is it considered that the income available to the customer after servicing 
the debt may involve a clear limitation to cover the borrower’s household expenses. 
c) 
The personal, work and income stability of the risk party or parties 
This criterion considers and classifies customers according to their level of work and 
income stability. 
d) 
Information from payment and court files 
Verification as to whether the party or parties appears in information from payment 
and court files, evaluating the reason, whether there was an error, or if it was due to 
lack of ability to pay; if paid, when and in what amount. 
Risk transactions are not approved for customers without guarantors who appear in 
such files, unless the amount is below the threshold established in the risk policy for 
the product. 
The evaluation of the customer’s payment capacity takes into account whether the 
party or parties has had any type of debt restructuring with the Seller or if there were 
payment incidents or defaults on previously authorised transactions. 
• 
Transaction risk: Criteria relating to the following will be evaluated:  
✓ 
Reasonableness of the transaction and term: The customer’s request, 
contained in the risk proposal, must be consistent with the purpose 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 – Additional Information 
Page 121 
reported/declared by the customer. There is an evaluation as to whether the 
proposed term and form of repayment are in accordance with the type of 
financing requested, as well as with the transaction being financed. 
In the case of foreign currency loans and credit facilities, the repayment 
structure and whether customers’ primary sources of income are generated 
from the same or another currency are taken into account. If they come from 
another currency, the borrower’s ability to withstand adverse fluctuations in 
exchange rates and the foreign interest rate must be assessed. 
Additionally, in the case of loans and credit facilities indexed to variable 
interest rates, there will be an assessment of the borrower’s ability to 
withstand potential increases in the interest rates and, therefore, the 
repayment instalments.  
• 
Security (financial, personal): Additional security reduces credit risk, given that 
in the case of non-payment by the risk party, and by way of the appropriate 
recovery procedures, recovery is possible via the financial instruments or via the 
secured assets or via the personal guarantees. When a request includes 
collateralisation, at least the following will be taken into account:  
✓ 
The type of guarantee being acceptable in accordance with applicable law.  
✓ 
The financial instrument or the secured asset being perfectly identified.  
✓ 
The amount and value of the security.  
✓ 
Value fluctuation during the effectiveness of the security and of the secured 
obligation.  
✓ 
The reducing or mitigating effect that it has on the risk assumed or to be 
assumed with the customer. 
The internal rules govern the management and control of security (financial, and 
personal) with regard to customer risks, which assure the legal and financial 
effectiveness thereof and their preservation during the effective term of the 
transaction. 
• 
Risk premium and expected loss: The risk premium and expected loss to be 
assumed in a risk transaction must be within the range of acceptable quality 
established for the corresponding portfolio.  
• 
The price and other terms of the transaction: In the case of proposed 
restructurings of customer debts, the restructuring decision will mainly depend 
on the customer’s history and the debtor’s payment compliance, on any history 
of adjustments, on the customer’s ability and willingness to pay, and on whether 
the risk with the customer is reduced or mitigated by way of:  
✓ 
Payment in part or in full of the mature debt, including interest due.  
✓ 
The contribution of additional financial security.  
✓ 
The contribution of other additional guarantees.  
✓ 
Reduction of the risk by means of use of lower-risk products and terms.  
✓ 
Other amendments to the terms of the restructured transaction that permit 
the payment of the outstanding debt. 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 – Additional Information 
Page 122 
In any case, as a general rule, a maximum of one restructuring per year and of three 
restructurings every five years is established for a single risk. If these limits are exceeded, 
unless due to business or market external conditions, they shall be considered an indication 
of serious deterioration, and consequently must be classified as payment arrangements 
(acuerdos de pago).  
After the risk study a decision is made over the acceptance of the transaction and, if approved, 
formalisation, monitoring, assessment and control are carried out in accordance with the 
powers and duties delegated to the different bodies and persons entrusted therewith and 
applicable internal rules. 
In general, the Seller does not permit conditions for loans and credits beyond the general 
approved limits and conditions, though in the exceptional case that they arise, they are 
reviewed and managed as provided for in each case. 
2.2.7.2. 
Banco Santander Recovery Management 
1. 
Introduction 
1.1. 
Purposes 
This document describes the general risk framework and the credit risk framework for 
activities relating to the debt recovery management process. 
1.2. 
Definition and Extent 
Recovery efforts constitute a significant function within risk management at Banco Santander, 
as the quality of portfolios is key to the development and growth of the business. Debt 
collection and recovery management is thus the subject of special and continuous focus, in 
order to ensure that such quality remains within expected levels at all times. 
Recovery management can be defined as direct customer management aimed at the 
achievement of the following objectives: 
1. 
To maintain and strengthen the relationship with the customer by watching the 
customer’s payment behaviour, especially at the early stage of default. 
2. 
Trying to position the payment of the Group’s products and /or clients credit behaviour, 
in a high priority in their hierarchy, always complying with the current legal framework 
and existing good practices. 
3. 
Contributing to the improvement of customer credit behaviour. 
4. 
Correcting and recovering past due balances as quickly and cost effectively as possible, 
providing the most appropriate solution for the customer’s situation.  
5. 
Contributing to maximise recoveries and achieving a clear, credible and viable reduction 
in the balances for each portfolio. 
This model covers the activities carried out entirely during the recovery process. It comes 
into play the first day past due or when the customer is classified as non-performing for 
reasons other than borrower arrears (subjective non-performing) and ends with recovery of 
the debt (or sale of the asset in the event of deed in lieu of foreclosure) or a definitive write-
off.  
This model also covers customers who have been classified as non-performing for reasons 
other than borrower arrears (subjective non-performing), even though they are not in 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 – Additional Information 
Page 123 
arrears, as well as others for whom the entity deems it appropriate to initiate a debt recovery 
process. 
This model applies across all customer segments regardless of who is in charge of managing 
it. 
1.3. 
Scope 
This recovery model applies at Banco Santander. 
2. 
Processes and Responsibilities 
The recovery activity described in this recovery model rests upon the following four pillars: 
– 
Recovery risk policies. 
– 
Management strategies. 
– 
Implementation and monitoring of the business. 
– 
Comprehensive control and monitoring of business risk. 
The recoveries function is responsible for defining the strategies for management as well as 
for business performance and monitoring. The recoveries function is responsible for defining 
the recoveries strategy. 
2.1 
Strategy development 
In the specific case of NPEs (non-performing exposures) and, where applicable, foreclosed 
assets, the strategy should include quantitative objectives subject to deadlines for 
compliance, supported by their related operational plans. Both the strategy and the related 
operational plans will be defined and approved by the governing body and reviewed at least 
once a year. 
To make collection more efficient, the strategy should focus on identifying the management 
levers and defining the best management channel to apply to each customer, based on their 
characteristics and issues. 
2.1.1  
Objectives 
Reasonable non-performing levels will be established in the short and medium term, both in 
relative and absolute terms.  
Objectives may be established both at portfolio and aggregate level. Wherever possible, both 
historical and international references will be taken into account when establishing objectives.  
The means for establishing short- and medium-term objectives are linked to the budget 
(short-term) and the strategic plan (medium-term).  
Quantitative objectives will be included (NPE inflows and outflows, recoveries and write-offs, 
non-performing levels) and clearly defined in the strategy, even for repossessed assets where 
appropriate. 
In the case of non-performing portfolios (carteras dudosas) of significant ageing, a specific 
reduction target must be established, in line with the bank’s expectations regarding the 
ageing of non-performing portfolios and, where appropriate, consistent with the risk appetite 
for these portfolios. 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 – Additional Information 
Page 124 
In this respect, the Seller’s expectations place the maximum age of non-performing loans at 
4 years. 
2.1.2.  
Management levers 
To reach the short-, medium- and long-term objectives for the different portfolios, the 
strategy considers the following (mutually compatible) management levers to be required:  
– 
Cash collection: it should always be the first collection option. The regularisation of 
a debt by collection implies the full or partial cancellation of the debt. 
– 
Renewal: Modification of the debt conditions for customers with financial difficulties, 
either current or foreseeable, which may prevent the fulfilment of their payment 
obligations.  
– 
Legal options: Litigation management involves pursuing the recovery of unpaid debt 
through qualified legal counsel and court proceedings; this complements any parallel 
out-of-court activities.  
– 
Write-offs, deeds in lieu and portfolio sales: Finalist management levers, their use 
being fundamental to maximise recovery with high risk profile customers with whom 
the relationship is extinguished, as well as when defining accelerated reduction 
strategies in run-off non-performing portfolios or portfolios of relevant age.  
2.1.3  
Management channels 
In the recoveries process, there are different management channels, both internal and 
external. Some of these are:  
– 
Business function: (manager, branches network): maintains contact with the 
customer in order to determine the reason why the default has arisen and in the early 
stages of arrears participates in the recoveries management.  
– 
Risk function: maintains the information related to the customer’s credit quality and 
valuation up to date and identifies warning alerts which enable changes in customers’ 
credit quality to be anticipated.  
– 
Recoveries managers: they are the specialists in the recoveries function, and therefore 
are responsible for defining the recoveries strategy and guaranteeing its correct 
execution. As the staff responsible for the cases, the recoveries managers are in 
charge of and manage the lawyers who are managing their cases and are responsible 
for supervising and making decisions regarding the judicial proceeding.  
– 
Workout function: They will be responsible for the management of the clients 
included within the workout perimeter, establishing the strategy and action plans to 
be carried out, as well as monitoring their performance, with the aim of avoiding 
non-payment or deterioration of the situation. 
– 
Telephone collection centres (internal and external to the entity): management 
through telephone contact with the customer from the first day past due or earlier, 
according to the strategies defined.  
– 
External collection agencies or companies: companies combining extra-judicial and 
judicial recovery management for the recovery of the debts assigned to them, as well 
as the management of foreclosed assets. 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 – Additional Information 
Page 125 
– 
Lawyers or litigation law firms: they are external lawyers or outsourced agencies 
which provide legal services and the possibility of complementary extrajudicial 
services.  
– 
Digital Channels: Apps, local units web portals, ATMs and any other channel that use 
big data, virtual assistants, payment platforms, voice recognition, geolocalisation, 
analytics, etc. 
– 
Portfolio sales: Portfolio sales of reperforming, non-performing or written-off portfolios 
are also considered for recovery purposes. 
Internal and external staff directly interacting with customers must have the necessary 
knowledge and skills in relation to the products on which they perform the activity, as well as 
on conduct practises with customers.  
Additionally, in the case of external services, quality standards must be applied in the selection 
and controlling process, establishing service level agreements (SLAs) that, amongst other 
things, include fair customer treatment. 
2.1.4  
Operational plan 
Once the objectives have been defined, the recoveries function defines the strategies and 
resource planning necessary to meet these objectives, which form part of the operational 
plan. This plan should detail, with sufficient granularity, the strategies and levers of execution 
for each of the sub-portfolios, customer segments, channels, etc. It is important in monitoring 
results to analyse internal and external factors that may hinder the effective realisation of 
the strategy. 
2.2. 
Integration of the strategy 
The strategy will be integrated into the processes at all levels within the organisation, 
including strategic and operational levels.  
The strategy’s essential elements will be communicated to the staff involved. This staff will 
be assigned clear objectives and incentives, geared towards compliance with the strategy and 
the operational plan. Related to conduct and quality, these incentives could take into account 
both the quantitative as the qualitative part.  
The strategy’s significant elements will be included and must be consistent with the business 
plan and the budget.  
Special attention will be paid to:  
– 
“Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process”, or ICAAP: All the NPE strategy’s 
significant elements should be in accordance with the ICAAP and integrated into it.  
– 
“Risk Appetite Framework”, where clearly defined indicators and RAF limits will be 
established and aligned with the strategy’s basic elements and objectives.  
– 
Whenever the recovery plan includes indicator levels relating to the NPEs, they will 
be aligned with the objectives and the operational plan for the NPE strategy.  
– 
For the various “Strategic Commercial Plans” (SCPs), it will be ensured that they are 
in accordance with rest of the commercial strategy.  
A high level of monitoring and control by the risk management functions will be guaranteed 
with regard to drawing up and applying the strategy and the operational plan.

Control and monitoring 
Dashboards are available to the recoveries and risk functions for their monitoring and control 
activities, providing an essential tool for the monitoring and control of recoveries activity. 
These dashboards provide an executive summary through a series of aggregated recoveries 
metrics for the different management segments defined.  
Meanwhile, the recoveries function, being responsible for the recoveries’ activity and business 
monitoring, designs any additional reports and dashboards needed, defining the lines of 
activity and variables, together with the frequency of the information. Specifically, it designs 
the dashboards needed for aggregate monitoring of the results of activities, and for effective 
measurement of actions undertaken at a sufficient level of detail for decision-making.

BANCO SANTANDER, S.A. - Consumer portfolio – Cumulative gross loss 
The following table shows the historical performance of consumer loans originated by Banco 
Santander with similar characteristics of a portfolio of equivalent loans (as defined in section 
1.1.1 of the Risk Factors) with the aim to inform potential investors of the performance of the 
consumer loan portfolio. It has been calculated by dividing (i) quarterly entries in arrears 
(including arrears which are cured) over (ii) the portfolio of equivalent loans, at the exposure 
level, originated in each quarter showed in the first column of the table. It should be noted 
that the relevant hypothesis shown in section 4.10 of the Securities Note are consistent with 
the data shown in the following table.

subordination of such obligation (together, the “Restructuring Events”), provided that such 
decision, with respect to the Restructuring Events, will be made: (i) with regard to the 
standards of a reasonable and prudent holder of such obligation (disregarding for such 
purposes the effect of any securitisation of such Receivable but taking into account any 
security or collateral allocable to that Receivable); and (ii) with the intent that such 
Restructuring is to minimise any expected loss in respect of such Receivable. 
2.2.9. 
SUBSTITUTION OF THE SECURITISED ASSETS 
If at any time after the Date of Incorporation or the relevant Purchase Date, it is observed 
that any of the Receivables failed to meet (i) the relevant Individual Eligibility Criteria (on its 
relevant date of assignment, i.e., the Incorporation Date in connection with the Initial 
Receivables or the relevant Purchase Date in connection with the Additional Receivables, as 
applicable) or (ii) the Global Eligibility Criteria (on the relevant Purchase Date in connection 
with the Additional Receivables), the Seller agrees, subject to the Management Company’s 
consent, to proceed forthwith to remedy said failure, and if said remedy is not possible, to 
replace or redeem the affected Receivable or any necessary Receivables (as applicable), 
thereby automatically terminating the assignment of such Receivables, subject to the 
following rules:  
 
The party becoming aware of the existence of a non-eligible Receivable, whether the 
Seller or the Management Company, will notify the other party thereof. The Seller will 
have up to fifteen (15) Business Days from said notice to proceed to remedy such 
circumstance if it is capable of being remedied or to replace the non-eligible Receivable. 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 – Additional Information 
Page 141 
 
Replacement will be made for the Outstanding Balance of the Receivable plus accrued 
and unpaid interest and any other amount owed to the Fund in relation to such non-
eligible Receivable until the date on which the relevant Receivable is substituted.  
In order to proceed with the replacement, the Seller will notify the Management 
Company of the characteristics of the Receivable proposed to be assigned satisfying 
the representations and warranties in section 2.2.8.5 of this Additional Information, 
and the Eligibility Criteria (both Individual Eligibility Criteria and Global Eligibility 
Criteria) as set forth in section 2.2.2.3.2 of this Additional Information, and having the 
similar purpose, term, interest rate and outstanding balance. Once the Management 
Company has verified that the Eligibility Criteria are satisfied and after having expressly 
communicated to the Seller that the Receivables to be assigned are eligible, the Seller 
shall proceed to terminate the replacement of the affected non-conforming Receivable 
and will assign the new Receivable or Receivables. 
The replacement of the Receivables shall be made by means of a deed of amendment 
of the Master Sale and Purchase Agreement or in a private agreement, subject, 
respectively, to the same formal requirements established for the initial assignment of 
the Receivables, and both shall be communicated to the CNMV and the Rating 
Agencies.  
 
If any Receivable is not replaced on the terms set out in paragraph (b) of this section, 
the Seller will proceed to automatically terminate the assignment of the affected non-
conforming Receivable. The termination will take place by means of the cash

3.3.1. 
FORMALISATION OF THE ASSIGNMENT OF THE RECEIVABLES 
(i) 
Assignment of the Initial Receivables 
The assignment of the Initial Receivables by the Seller to the Fund will be effected on 
the Date of Incorporation by means of the execution of the Master Sale and Purchase 
Agreement, which will be granted simultaneously with the Deed of Incorporation and 
upon incorporation of the Fund. 
(ii) 
Assignment of the Additional Receivables 
After the Date of Incorporation, on the relevant Purchase Date during the Revolving 
Period, the Fund, represented by the Management Company, will purchase Additional 
Receivables to compensate the reduction in the Outstanding Balance of the Receivables 
pooled in the Fund up to a maximum amount equal to the Principal Target Redemption 
Amount on the Determination Date preceding the relevant Payment Date, provided 
that the Seller has sufficient Additional Receivables to be assigned to the Fund meeting 
the Eligibility Criteria on such assignment date. 
Additional Receivables will be assigned to the Fund by means of purchase offers and 
their acceptance by the Fund, in compliance with the provisions of (i) section 2.2.2.3.3 
above; (ii) the Deed of Incorporation; and (iii) the Master Sale and Purchase 
Agreement. 
Any expenses and taxes resulting from the formalisation of successive assignments

documents to the CNMV:

Eligibility Criteria) as set forth in section 2.2.2.3.2 of this Additional Information 
and the representations and warranties set forth in section 2.2.8.5 of this 
Additional Information for their assignment to the Fund. 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 – Additional Information 
Page 149 
The Seller’s assignment of the Receivables to the Fund shall not be notified to the Borrowers 
except as foreseen in section 3.7.1.12 of this Additional Information.  
3.3.2. 
RECEIVABLES ASSIGNMENT TERMS 
The assignment of the Receivables will be full and unconditional and for the whole remaining 
period up to the maturity of each Receivable. 
Banco Santander, as Seller of the Receivables and in accordance with article 348 of the 
Spanish Commercial Code and article 1,529 of the Spanish Civil Code, will be liable vis-à-vis 
the Fund for the existence and lawfulness of the Receivables but will not be responsible for 
the solvency of the Borrowers.  
The Seller does not assume the risk of payment default of the Receivables and, therefore, 
does not assume any liability for the payment default by the Borrowers, whether for principal, 
interest or any other amount due under the Loans, nor does it assume the effectiveness of 
the guarantees or security granted as security thereof (if any in the future). Furthermore, the 
Seller will not in any other manner whatsoever guarantee directly or indirectly the success of 
the transaction or give any security or Notes or enter into any repurchase or replacement 
agreements as regards the Receivables, except as described in section 2.2.9 of this Additional 
Information. 
Considering that “Receivables” means the receivables assigned to the Fund which represent 
95% of any and all of the receivables arising from the Loans (as of the Date of Incorporation 
in connection with the Initial Receivables and as of the relevant Purchase Date in connection 
with the Additional Receivables), the receivables under each Loan will be assigned for 95% 
(i) of the Outstanding Balance as of the Date of Incorporation or the relevant Purchase Date 
(as applicable) (ii) of the ordinary and default interest on each Loan, and (iii) of the rights 
arising from any collateral to the Loans, if applicable. 
Specifically, and by way of description and not limitation, the assignment will include such 
95% (as of the Date of Incorporation in connection with the Initial Receivables and as of the 
relevant Purchase Date in connection with the Additional Receivables) of all accessory rights 
in accordance with the provisions of article 1,528 of the Spanish Civil Code; thus, it will give 
the Fund the following rights as regards the Loans:  
 
of all amounts due for repayment of the principal of the Loans. 
 
of all amounts due for ordinary interest on the Loans. 
 
of all amounts due for default interest on the Loans. 
 
of all other amounts, assets or rights received as payment for Loan principal or interest.  
 
of all possible rights or compensation that might result in favour of Banco Santander, 
payments made by any guarantors, etc., as well as those arising from any right 
ancillary to the Loans. 
Therefore, any amounts received under the Loans, will be allocated to the Fund and the 
remaining to the Seller on a pari passu and pro rata basis. 
All of the aforementioned rights will accrue in favour of the Fund (i) in respect of the Initial 
Receivables, from the Date of Incorporation by virtue of the execution of the Master Sale and 
Purchase Agreement and (ii) with respect to the Additional Receivables, from the Purchase 
Date on which the assignment occurs under the Master Sale and Purchase Agreement, which 
shall be communicated to CNMV by CIFRADOC. 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 – Additional Information 
Page 150 
Any payments made in respect of fees for claims of unpaid instalments, fees for subrogation, 
fees for early redemption or cancellation and any other fees (including fees for opening, study 
and information, where appropriate) or expenses will not be assigned to the Fund and will 
therefore continue to correspond to the Seller. 
All possible expenses or costs that may arise for the Seller from recovery actions in the event 
of the Borrower failing to comply with his/her obligations, including enforcement actions 
against such Borrowers, will be paid by the Fund and the Seller on a pari passu and pro rata 
basis. 
The rights of the Fund resulting from the Receivables are linked to the payments made by 
the Borrowers under the Loans from which such Receivables arise and, therefore, are directly 
affected by the evolution, delays, pre-payments and any other incident related to such Loans. 
Expenses arising from the collection of payments defaults and expenses arising from pre-
judicial, judicial or contentious proceedings will be borne by the Servicer, notwithstanding the 
reimbursement right vis-à-vis the Fund provided for in section 3.7.1.8 of the Additional 
Information. 
With regard to the insolvency of the Seller: 
 
The Seller may be declared insolvent and insolvency of the Seller could affect its 
contractual relationship with the Fund, in accordance with the provisions of the Spanish 
Insolvency Law.  
 
The assignment of the Receivables cannot be subject to claw-back other than by an 
action brought by the Seller’s insolvency trustee (administración concursal), in 
accordance with the provisions of the Spanish Insolvency Law and after proving the 
existence of fraud in the transaction, as set forth in article 16.4 of Law 5/2015. The 
Seller has its place of business office in Spain. Therefore, and unless proof in the 
contrary, it is presumed that the centre of main interests is Spain. 
 
In the event that the Seller is declared insolvent, in accordance with the Spanish 
Insolvency Law, the Fund, represented by the Management Company, shall have the 
right of separation with respect to the Receivables, on the terms provided in articles 
239 and 240 of the Spanish Insolvency Law. Consequently, the Fund shall be entitled 
to obtain from the insolvent Seller the resulting Receivables amounts from the date on 
which the insolvency is decreed, being those amounts considered Fund’s property and 
must therefore be transferred to the Fund, represented by the Management Company.  
 
This right of separation would not necessarily extend to the cash received and kept by 
the insolvent Seller on behalf of the Fund before that date, given the essential fungible 
nature of money.  
Notwithstanding the above, both the Prospectus and the Deed of Incorporation provide for 
certain mechanism in order to mitigate the aforesaid effects in relation to cash due to its 
fungible nature as detailed in section 3.4.2.1 of the Additional Information.  
Section 3.3.1 above provides that the Seller’s assignment of the Receivables to the Fund shall 
not be notified to the Borrowers, except as foreseen in section 3.7.1.12 of the Additional 
Information. 
3.3.3. 
RECEIVABLES SALE OR ASSIGNMENT PRICE 
3.3.3.1. 
Price of the assignment of the Initial Receivables 
The assignment price payable by the Fund in respect of the Initial Receivables will be an 
amount equal to the Outstanding Balance of the Initial Receivables pooled in the Fund on the 
Date of Incorporation. 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 – Additional Information 
Page 151 
The assignment price will be paid in full before 12.00 CET on the Disbursement Date, for 
value date on that same day.  
The payment will be made once that the amount of the issuance of the Notes (and specifically, 
Classes A to E) and the Start-up Expenses Loan has been transferred to the Cash Flow 
Account. 
In the event of termination of the incorporation of the Fund, and thus of the assignment of 
the Receivables, (i) the obligation of the Fund to pay the price for the acquisition of the 
Receivables will be extinguished, and (ii) the Management Company will be obliged to 
reimburse the Seller for any rights that might have been accrued in favour of the Fund due 
to the assignment of the Receivables. 
The Seller will not receive any interest as a result of the deferral of payment of the assignment 
price from the Date of Incorporation to the Disbursement Date. 
3.3.3.2. 
Price of the assignment of Additional Receivables 
The Additional Receivables will be assigned at a price equal to Acquisition Amount as of the 
relevant Purchase Date. 
The price must be paid in full on the corresponding Payment Date in which the assignment is 
effectuated, for value that same day, by crediting the Principal Account opened with the Fund 
Accounts Provider in the name of the Fund. 
3.4. 
Explanation of the flow of funds 
3.4.1. 
HOW THE CASH FLOWS FROM THE ASSETS WILL MEET THE ISSUER’S OBLIGATIONS TO HOLDERS OF THE 
SECURITIES, INCLUDING, IF NECESSARY, A FINANCIAL SERVICE TABLE AND A DESCRIPTION OF THE 
ASSUMPTIONS USED IN DEVELOPING THAT TABLE 
The Fund will attend all payment obligations arising from the Notes and its remaining liabilities 
by applying the cash flows generated by the Receivables and any other applicable rights of 
the Fund. 
The amounts received by the Fund arising from the Receivables will be deposited by the 
Servicer into the Cash Flow Account within two (2) Business Days from their receipt. 
The Fund will benefit from the additional protection and enhancement mechanisms that are 
described in section 3.4.2 below. These mechanisms will be applied in accordance with the 
rules of this Prospectus and their purpose is to ensure that the cash flows of the Fund are 
sufficient to attend its payment obligations in accordance with the Pre-Enforcement Priority 
of Payments set forth in section 3.7.4.2 of this Additional Information and the Post-
Enforcement Priority of Payments set forth in section 3.4.7.3 of this Additional Information, 
as applicable. 
All payments of principal and interest on the Notes shall be made in accordance with the rules 
of this Prospectus and the Pre-Enforcement Priority of Payments set forth in section 3.7.4.2 
of this Additional Information and the Post-Enforcement Priority of Payments set forth in 
section 3.4.7.3 of this Additional Information, as applicable. 
The weighted average interest rate of the selected Loans in the Preliminary Portfolio, as shown 
in table (iii) of section 2.2.2.2 (Receivables) above, amounts to 6.70%, which is higher than 
the weighted average interest rate of the Notes (which is 3.24 %, assuming a 3-month 
EURIBOR rate of 2.143% on 13 May 2025).

Credit enhancements 
In order to (i) strengthen the financial structure of the Fund; (ii) increase the security or the 
regularity in the payments of the Notes; (iii) partially cover any temporary mismatches of the 
schedule of flows of principal and interest on the Loans and the interest payable in respect of 
the Notes or, in general, to transform the financial characteristics of the Loans and the Notes; 
and (iv) ensure the proper operation of the Fund and performance of its obligations in the 
terms and conditions set out in the applicable laws from time to time, the Management 
Company, on behalf of the Fund, will enter into the transactions and Transaction Documents 
described below in accordance with the Deed of Incorporation and all applicable legal 
provisions. 
The credit enhancements included in the structure of the Fund are the following: 
 
Reserve Fund 
The Reserve Fund mitigates the credit risk due to payment default under the Loans. 
The Reserve Fund is described below in section 3.4.2.2 of this Additional Information. 
 
Interest Rate Swap Agreement 
The Interest Rate Swap Agreement mitigates part of the interest rate risk arising from 
potential future increases of the interest rate applicable to the Notes (EURIBOR 3-
month) above the interest rate applicable under the fixed Loans. The main terms and 
conditions of the Interest Rate Swap Agreement are described in section 3.4.8.1 of this 
Additional Information. 
The Receivables do not include derivatives and the Fund has not entered into and will 
not enter into any kind of hedging instrument save as expressly permitted by article 
21 (2) of the EU Securitisation Regulation. 
Additionally, there is no currency risk given that both the Receivables and the Notes

Initial Funding 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 – Additional Information 
Page 153 
The Reserve Fund will be funded on the Disbursement Date with the proceeds from the 
disbursement of Class F Notes. 
Subsequent funding 
On each Payment Date until the Reserve Fund Termination Date, the Reserve Fund shall be 
funded in an amount equal to the Required Level of the Reserve Fund, provided that there 
are sufficient Available Funds pursuant to the Pre-Enforcement Priority of Payments. 
Adjustment of the Reserve Fund 
The Reserve Fund shall be required to be equal to: 
(1) 
On the Disbursement Date and during the Revolving Period, the Reserve Fund will have 
an initial balance of 1.5% of the initial balance of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, 
the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes and the Class E Notes on the Date of Incorporation 
(the “Initial Reserve Fund”) and will remain constant during the Revolving Period. 
(2) 
On each Payment Date up to (but excluding) the Reserve Fund Termination Date, the 
Reserve Fund may be reduced and be the higher of (the “Required Level of the 
Reserve Fund”): 
 
0.50% of the Principal Amount Outstanding of the Class A Notes, the Class B 
Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes and the Class E Notes on the 
Disbursement Date, and 
 
the lower of the following amounts: 
(i) 
1.5% of the Principal Amount Outstanding of the Class A Notes, the Class 
B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes and the Class E Notes on 
the precedent Determination Date; and 
(ii) 
The Initial Reserve Fund. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Required Level of the Reserve Fund will not be 
allowed to be reduced on the applicable Payment Date and will remain at the Required 
Level of the Reserve Fund on the immediately preceding Payment Date if any of the 
following circumstances occurs: 
 
if the Reserve Fund has not been funded to a value equal to the Required Level 
of the Reserve Fund on the preceding Payment Date; or 
 
in case a Subordination Event occurs. 
(3) 
Upon arrival of the Reserve Fund Termination Date, zero (0). 
3.4.2.3. 
Subordination of the Notes 
After the occurrence of a Subordination Event, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class 
C Notes, the Class D Notes and the Class E Notes will be redeemed sequentially in accordance 
with the Pre-Enforcement Priority of Payments set forth in section 3.4.7.2 of this Additional 
Information so that: 
 
the Class B Notes will not be further redeemed for so long as the Class A Notes have 
not been redeemed in full; 
 
the Class C Notes will not be further redeemed for so long as the Class A Notes and 
the Class B Notes have not been redeemed in full; 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 – Additional Information 
Page 154 
 
the Class D Notes will not be further redeemed for so long as the Class A Notes, the 
Class B Notes and the Class C Notes have not been redeemed in full; and 
 
the Class E Notes will not be further redeemed for so long as the Class A Notes, the 
Class B Notes, Class C Notes and the Class D Notes have not been redeemed in full. 
Class F Notes will be redeemed with the available excess spread for an amount equal to 
Class F Notes Target Amortisation Amount in accordance with the Pre-Enforcement Priority 
of Payments set forth in section 3.4.7.2 of this Additional Information. Once the Class F 
Notes are fully redeemed, the subordination of such Class F will no longer apply.  
On the Notes Maturity Date or upon the Early Redemption of the Notes in accordance with 
section 4.4.3 of the Registration Document, the Class F Notes will be redeemed by applying 
the Post-Enforcement Priority of Payments set forth in section 3.4.7.3 Following such Post-
Enforcement Priority of Payments, redemption of principal of the Class F Notes will occupy 
the fifteenth (15th) place of the Post-Enforcement Priority of Payment. 
3.4.3. 
RISK RETENTION REQUIREMENT 
3.4.3.1. 
EU Retention Requirement 
The Seller, as Originator, will undertake in the Deed of Incorporation to retain, on an ongoing 
basis, a material net economic interest of at least 5 (five) per cent. of the nominal value of 
each of the securitised exposures in the securitisation transaction described in this Prospectus 
in accordance with article 6(3)(a) of the EU Securitisation Regulation, as supplemented by 
article 4(c) of the Delegated Regulation 2023/2175. 
In addition, the Seller has undertaken that the material net economic interest held by it shall 
not be subject to any credit-risk mitigation or hedging, in accordance with article 6(1) of the 
EU Securitisation Regulation, except as permitted by the Delegated Regulation 2023/2175 
(or any related regulation). 
The retention option and methodology used to calculate the net economic interest will not 
change, unless such change is required due to exceptional circumstances and that change is 
not used as a means to reduce the amount of the retained interest, in which case such change 
will be appropriately disclosed to Noteholders and published on the following website 
www.santanderdetitulizacion.com. 
The Deed of Incorporation will include a representation and warranty and undertaking of the 
Originator as to its compliance with the requirements set forth in article 6(1) of the EU 
Securitisation Regulation. In addition to the information set out herein and forming part of 
this Prospectus, the Originator has undertaken to make available materially relevant 
information to investors so that investors are able to verify compliance with article 6 of the 
EU Securitisation Regulation in accordance with article 7 of the EU Securitisation Regulation, 
as set out in section 4.2.1 of this Additional Information. In particular, the quarterly reports 
shall include information about the risk retained pursuant to article 6(1) of the EU 
Securitisation Regulation, including information on which of the modalities of retention have 
been applied as provided for in article 6(3) of the EU Securitisation Regulation pursuant to 
paragraph to 1(e)(iii) of article 7 of the EU Securitisation Regulation. The Seller will undertake 
in the Deed of Incorporation to include in its webpage (www.santander.com) (or the replacing 
webpage in the future) a reference to the location where all the updated information regarding 
the retention requirement can be found. 
Each prospective investor is required to independently assess and determine the sufficiency 
of the information described above and generally, in this Prospectus, for the purposes of 
complying with each of the provisions described above and any corresponding implementing 
measures which may be applicable. In addition, each prospective Noteholder should ensure 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 – Additional Information 
Page 155 
that they comply with the implementing provisions in respect of the EU Securitisation 
Regulation. 
Investors who are uncertain as to the requirements which apply to them in respect of their 
relevant jurisdiction, should seek guidance from their regulator. 
3.4.3.2. 
US Risk Retention 
Section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act amended the Exchange Act to generally require the 
“securitiser” of a “securitisation transaction” to retain at least five per cent (5%) of the “credit 
risk” of “securitised assets”, as such terms are defined for purposes of that statute, and 
generally prohibit a securitiser from directly or indirectly eliminating or reducing its credit 
exposure by hedging or otherwise transferring the credit risk that the securitiser is required 
to retain. Final rules implementing the statute (the “U.S. Risk Retention Rules”) came into 
effect on 24 December 2016 with respect to non-RMBS securitisations. The U.S. Risk 
Retention Rules provide that the securitiser of an asset backed securitisation is its sponsor. 
The U.S. Risk Retention Rules also provide for certain exemptions from the risk retention 
obligation that they generally impose. 
The Seller does not intend to retain at least five per cent (5%) of the credit risk of the 
securitised assets for the purposes of the U.S. Risk Retention Rules and the issuance of the 
Notes was not designed to comply with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules. The Seller intends to 
rely on an exemption provided for in Section 20 of the U.S. Risk Retention Rules regarding 
non-U.S. transactions. Such non-U.S. transactions must meet certain requirements, including 
that (1) the transaction is not required to be and is not registered under the United States 
Securities Act; (2) no more than ten per-cent (10%) of the dollar value (or equivalent amount 
in the currency in which the securities are issued) of all classes of securities issued in the 
securitisation transaction are sold or transferred to U.S. persons (in each case, as defined in 
the U.S. Risk Retention Rules) or for the account or benefit of U.S. persons (as defined in the 
U.S. Risk Retention Rules and referred to in this Prospectus as Risk Retention U.S. Persons); 
(3) neither the sponsor nor the issuer is organised under U.S. law or is a branch located in 
the United States of a non-U.S. entity; and (4) no more than twenty-five per cent (25%) of 
the underlying collateral was acquired from a majority-owned affiliate or branch of the 
sponsor or issuer organised or located in the United States. 
The Seller has advised the Fund that it has not acquired, and it does not intend to acquire 
more than twenty-five per cent (25%) of the assets from an affiliate or branch of the Seller 
or the Fund that is chartered, incorporated, organised or located in the United States. 
Prior to any Notes which are issued by the Fund and offered and sold by the Joint Lead 
Managers being purchased by, or for the account or benefit of, any Risk Retention U.S. 
Person, the purchaser of such Notes must first disclose to the Seller and the Joint Lead 
Managers that it is a Risk Retention U.S. Person and obtain the written consent of the Seller 
in the form of a U.S. Risk Retention Consent. Prospective investors should note that the 
definition of “U.S. person” in the U.S. Risk Retention Rules is different from the definition of 
“U.S. person” under Regulation S. The definition of U.S. person in the U.S. Risk Retention 
Rules is excerpted below. Particular attention should be paid to clauses (ii) and (viii), which 
are different than comparable provisions from Regulation S. 
Under the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, and subject to limited exceptions, “U.S. person” means 
any of the following:  
 
any natural person resident in the United States;  
 
any partnership or corporation organised or incorporated under the laws of the United 
States;  


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 – Additional Information 
Page 156 
 
any estate of which any executor or administrator is a U.S. person (as defined under 
any other clause of this definition);  
 
any trust of which any trustee is a U.S. person (as defined under any other clause of 
this definition);  
 
any agency or branch of a foreign entity located in the United States;  
 
any non-discretionary account or similar account (other than an estate or trust) held 
by a dealer or other fiduciary for the benefit or account of a U.S. person (as defined 
under any other clause of this definition);  
 
any discretionary account or similar account (other than an estate or trust) held by a 
dealer or other fiduciary organised, incorporated, or (if an individual) resident in the 
United States; and  
 
any partnership, corporation, limited liability company, or other organisation or entity 
if:  
(i) 
organised or incorporated under the laws of any foreign jurisdiction; and  
(ii) 
formed by a U.S. person principally for the purpose of investing in securities not 
registered under the United States Securities Act.  
Consequently, the Notes may not be purchased by any person except for (a) persons that are 
not Risk Retention U.S. Persons or (b) persons that have obtained a U.S. Risk Retention 
Consent from the Seller where such purchase falls within the exemption provided by Section 
20 of the U.S. Risk Retention Rules. Each holder of a Note or a beneficial interest therein 
acquired in the initial syndication of the Notes on the issue date, by its acquisition of a Note 
or a beneficial interest in a Note, will be deemed, and, in certain circumstances, will be 
required to represent to the Issuer, the Seller, the Management Company, the Arranger and 
the Joint Lead Managers that it (1) either (i) is not a Risk Retention U.S. Person or (ii) it has 
obtained a U.S. Risk Retention Consent, (2) is acquiring such Note or a beneficial interest 
therein for its own account and not with a view to distribute such Note and (3) is not acquiring 
such Note or a beneficial interest therein as part of a scheme to evade the requirements of 
the U.S. Risk Retention Rules (including acquiring such Note through a non-Risk Retention 
U.S. Person, rather than a Risk Retention U.S. Person, as part of a scheme to evade the 10 
per cent. Risk Retention U.S. Person limitation in the exemption provided for in Section 20 of 
the U.S. Risk Retention Rules described herein).  
The Seller has advised the Issuer that it will not provide a U.S. Risk Retention Consent to any 
investor if such investor’s purchase would result in more than 10 per cent. of the dollar value 
(or equivalent amount in the currency in which the securities are issued) (as determined by 
fair value under US GAAP) of all Classes of Notes to be sold or transferred to Risk Retention 
U.S. Persons on the Disbursement Date. 
There can be no assurance that the requirement to request the Seller to give its prior written 
consent to any Notes which are offered and sold by the Joint Lead Managers being purchased 
by, or for the account or benefit of, any Risk Retention U.S. Person will be complied with or 
will be made by such Risk Retention U.S. Persons. 
There can be no assurance that the exemption provided for in Section 20 of the U.S. Risk 
Retention Rules regarding non-U.S. transactions will be available. No assurance can be given 
as to whether a failure by the Seller to comply with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules (regardless 
of the reason for such failure to comply) may give rise to regulatory action which may 
adversely affect the Notes or the market value of the Notes. Furthermore, the impact of the 
U.S. Risk Retention Rules on the securitisation market generally is uncertain, and a failure by 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 – Additional Information 
Page 157 
the Seller to comply with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules could therefore negatively affect the 
market value and secondary market liquidity of the Notes.  
None of the Arranger, the Joint Lead Managers, the Seller, the Fund or any of their affiliates 
makes any representation to any prospective investor or purchaser of the Notes as to whether 
the transactions described in this Prospectus comply as a matter of fact with the U.S. Risk 
Retention Rules on the issue date or at any time in the future. Investors should consult their 
own advisors as to the U.S. Risk Retention Rules. No predictions can be made as to the precise 
effects of such matters on any investor or otherwise. 
3.4.4. 
DETAILS OF ANY FINANCING OF SUBORDINATED DEBT FINANCE 
3.4.4.1. 
Start-up Expenses Loan Agreement 
Description 
On the Date of Incorporation, the Management Company, in the name and on behalf of the 
Fund, will enter into a subordinated loan agreement (the “Start-Up Expenses Loan 
Agreement”) with Banco Santander (in such condition, the “Start-Up Expenses Loan 
Provider”) for a total amount in an estimated range from TWO MILLION EUROS (€ 
2,000,000) to FOURTEEN MILLION EUROS (€ 14,000,000) (the “Start-Up Expenses Loan”), 
which will be used to finance the initial expenses of the incorporation of the Fund and the 
issue of the Notes.  
For the avoidance of doubt, the initial expenses shall include, inter alia: 
 
the Pre-hedge Novation Amount, which will be determined (if applicable) prior to the 
Date of Incorporation as explained in section 3.4.8.1 of the Additional Information,  
 
if necessary, the residual purchase price of the Initial Receivables in an amount equal 
to the difference (if any) between the nominal value of the Class A Notes, the Class B 
Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes and the Class E Notes and the Outstanding 
Balance of the Initial Receivables (since the maximum amount of the Outstanding 
Balance of the Initial Receivables pooled in the Fund will be equal to or slightly higher 
than the Maximum Receivables Amount, as explained in section 2.2 of the Additional 
Information), 
 
the registration of the prospectus with the CNMV, AIAF and IBERCLEAR, and 
 
other third parties expenses (which include Rating Agencies, legal advisors, Auditors, 
Arranger, Joint Lead Managers, Management Company, PCS, cash flow model 
providers, translation fees, notarial services and fees from other rating agencies 
involved). 
The proceeds of the Start-Up Expenses Loan will be credited to the Cash Flow Account before 
12.00 p.m. CET on the Disbursement Date, for value date on the same date. 
Banco Santander specifically and irrevocably waives any right of set-off against the Fund that 
could otherwise correspond to it by virtue of any agreement entered into with the Fund. 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 – Additional Information 
Page 158 
Early Termination 
The maturity date of the Start-Up Expenses Loan Agreement will be the Legal Maturity Date 
of the Fund. 
Notwithstanding the above, the Start-Up Expenses Loan Agreement will be terminated 
(except for the initial expenses of incorporation of the Fund and the issuance of the Notes): 
 
if the provisional credit ratings of the Rated Notes are not confirmed as final by the 
Rating Agencies on or prior the Disbursement Date (and in any case, prior to the 
disbursement of the Notes), unless such provisional ratings are upgraded; or  
 
if the Management, Placement and Subscription Agreement is terminated in 
accordance with the provisions of section 4.2.3 of the Securities Note. 
Subordination nature of the Start-Up Expenses Loan 
Given that this Start-Up Expenses Loan is a subordinated loan, it will be postponed in ranking 
as regards the rest of creditors of the Fund pursuant to the terms of sections 3.4.7.2 and 
3.4.7.3 of this Additional Information, including, but not limited to, the Noteholders. 
Repayment of principal 
All amounts due under the Start-Up Expenses Loan corresponding to principal shall be 
repayable on each Payment Date provided that there are sufficient Available Funds in 
accordance with the Pre-Enforcement Priority of Payments or, where applicable, Post-
Enforcement Available Funds in accordance with the Post-Enforcement Priority of Payments 
described in sections 3.4.7.2 and 3.4.7.3 of this Additional Information, respectively. 
For clarification purposes, the Start-Up Expenses Loan may be early repaid in full on the First 
Payment Date provided that the Fund has sufficient Available Funds after payment of items 
(1) to (15) of the Pre-Enforcement Priority of Payments (set forth in section 3.4.7.2 of this 
Additional Information) or, where applicable, Post-Enforcement Available Funds, after 
payment of items (1) to (16) of the Post-Enforcement Priority of Payments (set forth in section 
in section 3.4.7.3 of this Additional Information). 
Remuneration 
The Start-Up Expenses Loan will accrue an annual interest, calculated on a quarterly basis, 
for each Interest Accrual Period, which will be equal to 3 (three)-month EURIBOR (as defined 
below) with floor at 0.00%, plus a margin of 0.13% and will be paid only if the Fund has 
sufficient Available Funds in accordance with the Pre-Enforcement Priority of Payments 
established in section 3.4.7.2 of this Additional Information, or, where applicable, Post-
Enforcement Available Funds, in accordance with the Post-Enforcement Priority of Payments 
described in section 3.4.7.3 of this Additional Information. Any interest accrued, which must 
be paid on a specified Payment Date, will be calculated on the basis of: (i) the actual days 
existing in each Interest Accrual Period, and (ii) a year of three hundred and sixty (360) days. 
For the purposes of calculating the interest payable under the Start-Up Expenses Loan, the 
reference rate will be EURIBOR (Euro Interbank Offered Rate), which is the money market 
reference rate for deposits in euros at three (3) months maturity (except in respect of the 
Initial Interest Accrual Period, where it shall be the rate per annum obtained by linear 
interpolation of the EURIBOR for three (3) and six (6) month deposits in Euro (rounded to 
four decimal places with the mid-point rounded up), taken from the Reuters page EURIBOR01 
(or any other page that replaces this page in the future, the “Relevant Screen”). If such 
page (or any other page that replaces this page in the future) is not available, the Relevant 
Screen will be –in this order– the electronic information pages offering EURIBOR rates 
(published by the European Banking Federation) such as Telerate, Bloomberg or any other 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 – Additional Information 
Page 159 
page used in the market to show the EURO Interbank Market at 11.00 a.m. CET on two (2) 
Business Days preceding the date of commencement of each Interest Accrual Period. 
If it is impossible to obtain the EURIBOR for such period of time, the reference interest rate 
will be the interest rate resulting from the simple arithmetic mean of the interbank offered 
interest rates for non-transferrable deposits, in the currency of the issue, that are provided 
by four (4) leading banking entities. 
If it is not possible to apply such reference interest rate, due to the fact that any of the four 
entities has continuously failed to provide the statement of quotations, the applicable interest 
rate will be the result of the simple arithmetic mean of the interest rates provided by, at least, 
two (2) of the leading entities. 
If it is not possible to obtain the rates established in the preceding paragraphs, it will be 
necessary to apply the last reference interest rate applied to the last Interest Accrual Period 
and it will remain applicable as long as such situation persists. 
Upon a Base Rate Modification Event, the Alternative Base Rate provisions regulated in section 
4.8.5 of the Securities Note shall be applicable to the Start-Up Expenses Loan. 
Interest due and not paid on a Payment Date will accumulate and accrue interest at the same 
rate as the nominal interest rate of the Start-Up Expenses Loan and will be paid, provided 
that the Fund has sufficient Available Funds or Post-Enforcement Available Funds, as 
applicable, on the immediately following Payment Date and in accordance with the Pre-
Enforcement Priority of Payments established in section 3.4.7.2 of this Additional Information, 
or, where applicable, with the Post-Enforcement Priority of Payments described in section 
3.4.7.3 of this Additional Information. 
The interest rate under the Start-Up Expenses Loan may be reviewed and modified annually, 
starting from the first anniversary of the Date of Incorporation, provided that the Start-Up 
Expenses Loan has not been repaid in full by such time.

SPECIFICATION OF ANY INVESTMENT PARAMETER FOR THE INVESTMENT OF TEMPORARY LIQUIDITY 
SURPLUSES AND DESCRIPTION OF THE PARTIES RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SAID INVESTMENT 
3.4.5.1. 
Fund Accounts 
On the Date of Incorporation, the Management Company, in the name and on behalf of the 
Fund will enter into a reinvestment agreement (the “Reinvestment Agreement”) with 
Banco Santander (the “Fund Accounts Provider”), by virtue of which the Fund Accounts 
Provider will open in its books the following bank accounts (the “Fund Accounts”): 
 
the Cash Flow Account;  
 
the Principal Account; and 
 
the Swap Collateral Account. 
Cash Flow Account 
Pursuant to the Reinvestment Agreement the amounts to be credited to the Cash Flow 
Account will include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 
principal and interests on the Receivables; 
 
any other amounts corresponding to the Receivables, and to the disposal or use of 
assets awarded, or under provisional administration and possession of the assets 
during enforcement proceedings, as well as all possible rights and compensations, 
including those arising from any ancillary right to the Receivables, but excluding fees; 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 – Additional Information 
Page 160 
 
the amount which constitutes the Reserve Fund at any time, as described in section 
3.4.2.2 of this Additional Information; 
 
the amounts received under the Interest Rate Swap Agreement (other than amounts 
received as collateral and deposited in the Swap Collateral Account that will be applied 
in accordance with the Interest Rate Swap Agreement), if any; 
 
the amounts of the returns obtained on actual Cash Flow Account and Principal Account 
balances, if any; and 
 
the amounts of interim withholdings on the return on investments to be effected on 
each relevant Payment Date on the Note interest paid by the Fund, until due for 
payment to the Tax Administration, if any.  
All collections and payments during the entire life of the Fund will be centralised in the Cash 
Flow Account. 
On the Disbursement Date, the following amounts will be deposited in the Cash Flow Account: 
 
the effective subscription price of the Notes issued; and  
 
the amount drawn down under the Start-Up Expenses Loan for satisfying the initial 
expenses of the incorporation of the Fund and the issuance of the Notes. 
Furthermore, on or about the Disbursement Date, as applicable, the following items will be 
paid out of the amounts deposited in the Cash Flow Account: 
 
the purchase price of the Initial Receivables; and 
 
the initial expenses of the incorporation of the Fund and the issuance of the Notes. For 
clarification purposes, payments of these expenses will be paid as soon as each 
expense becomes due and payable. 
The Fund Accounts Provider, in accordance with the instructions received from the 
Management Company, shall apply the balance existing in the Cash Flow Account on each 
Payment Date in accordance with the Pre-Enforcement Priority of Payments (or the Post-
Enforcement Priority of Payments, as applicable). 
Principal Account 
As described in section 3.4.7.2 below, by virtue of the Reinvestment Agreement, only during 
the Revolving Period and provided that the Fund has sufficient Available Funds, the amounts 
that, from time to time, make up the Principal Target Redemption Amount will be deposited 
in the Principal Account. 
The relevant amounts will be transferred from the Cash Flow Account to the Principal Account 
on the relevant Payment Date, following the procedure established in item (11) of the Pre-
Enforcement Priority of Payments in section 3.4.7.2 of this Additional Information. Upon the 
termination of the Revolving Period, the Principal Account shall be closed, transferring the 
remaining amount (if any) to the Cash Flow Account. 
Any amounts received by the Fund as interest accrued on the balances credited to the 
Principal Account, if applicable, will be transferred to the Cash Flow Account immediately upon 
receipt thereof. 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 – Additional Information 
Page 161 
Swap Collateral Account 
Pursuant to the Reinvestment Agreement, the Swap Collateral Account will be credited with 
any cash collateral to be posted by the Swap Counterparty under the Interest Rate Swap 
Agreement, as described in section 3.4.8.1 of the Additional Information.  
Cash standing to the credit of the Swap Collateral Account (including interest) shall not be 
Available Funds (except as otherwise foreseen in section 3.4.8.1 of this Additional 
Information) for the Fund to make payments in accordance with the relevant Priority of 
Payments.  
In the event that the Fund Accounts Provider for the Swap Collateral Account defaults in its 
obligations under the Reinvestment Agreement and due to such default, the Fund is not able 
to immediately apply the collateral amounts held on such account towards any due payment 
to the Swap Counterparty, the amount payable by the Fund to the Swap Counterparty shall 
be paid according to the Pre-Enforcement Priority of Payments or the Post-Enforcement 
Priority of Payments, as applicable. 
Interest 
 
Cash Flow Account and Principal Account: 
On the Disbursement Date and until a change on its remuneration has occurred, the 
amounts deposited in the Cash Flow Account and Principal Account will accrue, an 
interest equivalent to €STR – 40 basis points. However, in the event that such resulting 
rate falls below 0 (zero), the applicable interest will be equal to zero per cent (0.00%). 
For the purposes of this section, “€STR” means, in respect of an Interest Accrual Period 
in respect of the balances standing to the credit on the Cash Flow Account and Principal 
Account, the euro short-term rate equal to the overnight rate as calculated by the ECB 
and appearing on the relevant screen page on the first (1st) Business Day of the month 
on which such Interest Accrual Period begins. In case €STR ceases to be provided 
permanently or indefinitely, any mention to that reference rate shall be understood as 
made to the rate (inclusive of any spreads or adjustments) recommended by the ECB 
(or any successor administrator) in replacement of the €STR as published or provided 
by the administrator thereof. 
The applicable interest, as defined above: 
(i) 
will be calculated on the basis of a 365-day year; 
(ii) 
shall accrue on a daily basis; and 
(iii) 
shall be credited monthly by the Fund Accounts Provider from the Cash Flow 
Account and Principal Account on the first (1st) day of each calendar month or if 
that day is not a Business Day the next immediately following Business Day. 
The Fund, acting through the Management Company hereby irrevocably 
authorises the Fund Accounts Provider to debit from the Cash Flow Account and 
Principal Account the amount of any accrued interests in favour of the Fund 
Accounts Provider. 
 
Swap Collateral Account: 
On the Disbursement Date and until a change on its remuneration has occurred, the 
amounts deposited in the Swap Collateral Account from time to time will not accrue 
any interest as long as the Funds Account Provider is Banco Santander. Nevertheless, 
in the event of replacement of Banco Santander as Fund Accounts Provider, such fund 
accounts might accrue interest. 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 – Additional Information 
Page 162 
 
Change of remuneration of the Fund Accounts: 
Notwithstanding the provisions set out above, the Fund Accounts can change its 
remuneration under the Reinvestment Agreement, in which case the new interest rate 
will be reported by Banco Santander, or the Management Company, as the case may 
be, to the rest of the parties. If the remuneration is negative, this will be considered a 
Fund expense. 
Rating Agencies Criteria for the Fund Accounts Provider 
In the event that the rating of the Fund Accounts Provider or of the replacing entity in which 
the Fund Accounts are opened is downgraded, at any time during the life of the Notes issue: 
 
below BBB (high) according to the minimum MDBRS rating (the “MDBRS Minimum 
Rating”) which shall be the higher of: 
(1) 
if the institution has a long-term critical obligation rating (COR) from MDBRS,

within sixty (60) calendar days from the day of the occurrence of any of the 
abovementioned events, transfer the Fund Accounts to an institution with a long-term

(i) 
of MDBRS Minimum Rating or higher; and/or 
(ii) 
with a Fitch Minimum Rating or higher;

and the Management Company will arrange the highest possible return for the balance 
of the Fund Accounts, which may be lower, equal to or higher than that arranged with 
the Fund Accounts Provider (or the replacing entity in which the Fund Accounts are 
opened). 
In this regard, the Fund Accounts Provider (or the replacing entity in which the Fund Accounts 
are opened) shall irrevocably agree to notify the Management Company of any change or 
removal of its rating given by the Rating Agencies, forthwith upon that occurrence throughout 
the life of the Rated Notes issue. 
All costs, expenses and taxes incurred due to the execution and formalisation of the previous 
options will be borne by Banco Santander or, if applicable, by the subsequent holder of the 
Fund Accounts. 
Other replacement events for the Fund Accounts Provider 
In the event that the Fund Accounts Provider (or of the replacing entity in which the Fund 
Accounts are opened) (i) defaults in its obligations under the Reinvestment Agreement, or 
(ii) is subject to any Insolvency Event, the Management Company will use its best endeavours 
to transfer the Fund Accounts to an institution with (i) MDBRS Minimum Rating or higher; 
and/or with a Fitch Minimum Rating or higher. 
3.4.6. 
HOW PAYMENTS ARE COLLECTED IN RESPECT OF THE RECEIVABLES 
The Servicer, as collection agent on behalf of the Fund, will collect any amounts for both 
principal and interest under the Receivables paid by the Borrowers, as well as any amounts 
corresponding to the Fund, and will proceed to immediately deposit such amounts into the 
Cash Flow Account, as applicable, within two (2) Business Days from their receipt.  
The Servicer will not pay, in any case, any amount to the Fund that the Servicer has not 
previously received from the Borrowers in respect of the Loans. 
Powers of the holder of the Receivables in the case of breach by the Borrower or 
the Servicer of their obligations 
The Servicer will apply the same level of expertise, diligence and procedures for making a 
claim for the amounts due and unpaid on the Receivables as for the rest of loans contained 
in its portfolio. 
In particular, once the relevant periods for out-of-court actions to obtain payment of unpaid 
amounts under the Receivables have elapsed without having recovered the relevant unpaid 
amounts, the Servicer will bring any legal actions required for such purposes. In any case, 
the Servicer will bring the aforementioned legal actions if, after having analysed the specific 
circumstances of the case, the Management Company, on behalf of the Fund and in 
agreement with Banco Santander, deems it appropriate.  
 The current recovery processes applied by the Servicer are included in section 2.2.7.3 
(Arrears, recovery and prepayment information for consumer and financing loans originated 
by Banco Santander) of this Additional Information. 
 
Action against the Servicer 
The Management Company, for and on behalf of the Fund, may take action against the 
Servicer where the breach of the obligation to pay any principal repayment and interest 
and any other Loan amounts paid by the Borrowers due to the Fund does not result 
from default by the Borrowers and is attributable to the Servicer. 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 – Additional Information 
Page 164 
The Servicer will not be liable for such actions in case such breach is caused as a 
consequence of the compliance by the Servicer with the instructions given by the 
Management Company. 
 
Actions in case of non-payment of the Loans 
The Management Company, for and on behalf of the Fund, may take all the legal 
actions arising from the ownership of the Receivables, in accordance with the 
legislation in force.  
For the above purposes, the Management Company as responsible for servicing and 
managing the Receivables pursuant to article 26.1.b) of Law 5/2015, shall grant in the 
Deed of Incorporation a power of attorney as broad as permitted by law in favour of 
the Servicer, so that the Servicer, acting through any of its attorneys duly empowered 
for such purpose, following the instructions of the Management Company, in the name 
and on behalf of the latter, or in its own name albeit on behalf of the Management 
Company, as the authorised representative of the Fund, may demand any Borrower in 
or out of court to pay the debt and take legal action against the same, and if applicable 
to the guarantor, in addition to any other powers required for the performance of its 
duties as Servicer. These powers may also be granted under a document separate from 
the Deed of Incorporation or may be expanded and modified, if necessary, for the 
performance of such duties. 
Additionally, Banco Santander undertakes to inform the Management Company, on 
behalf of the Fund, on a quarterly basis, of any payment defaults, early redemptions 
and adjustments of the interest rates and term of maturity, and to provide timely 
information regarding payment demands, certified notices given to the borrower, legal 
actions, and any other circumstances affecting the Loans (including the sale of 
Defaulted Receivables). Furthermore, the Servicer will provide the Management 
Company with all the documents that the latter might request in relation to the Loans 
and, in particular, the documents that the Management Company might need for the 
purposes of bringing any legal actions.  
The Servicer shall, as a general rule, commence the relevant legal proceedings if, for 
a period of time of six (6) months, the Borrower in default of his/her payments 
obligations fails to resume payments, and the Servicer with the Management 
Company’s consent, fails to obtain a payment undertaking satisfactory to the interests 
of the Fund.  
Additionally, Defaulted Receivables may be sold by the Fund, represented by the 
Management Company, to third parties (directly or indirectly) in accordance with the 
applicable recovery processes applied by the Servicer (are included in section 2.2.7.3 
of the Additional Information) and in accordance with prevailing market conditions and 
at an arm’s length transaction (and, for the avoidance of doubt, without the need to 
obtain the consent of the Noteholders or other creditors of the Fund). An amount equal 
to the proceeds obtained from such sale shall amount to recoveries to be considered 
within limb (a) of the Available Funds’ definition.

Payments, as applicable, established in this section will be strictly followed, starting from the 
oldest item. 
3.4.7.4. 
Other rules - Replacement of Servicer 
If Banco Santander is replaced as the Servicer of the Receivables by another entity not 
forming part of Banco Santander’s consolidated group, a fee will be accrued in favour of the 
new Servicer, appearing in the second (2nd) place of the Pre-Enforcement Priority of Payments 
or the Post-Enforcement Priority of Payments set out in sections 3.4.7.2 and 3.4.7.3 above,

paid at first instance from the Servicer Event Reserve Amount, and subsidiarily with Available 
Funds upon insufficiency of the Servicer Event Reserve Amount. 
3.4.7.5. 
Expenses of the Fund 
The following is not an exhaustive list, and shall be considered ordinary expenses of the Fund 
(the “Ordinary Expenses”): 
 
expenses arising from compulsory administrative verifications, registrations and 
authorisations (other than payment of the initial expenses for the incorporation of the 
Fund and issuance of the Notes), and admission expenses and the ongoing fee payable 
to the EU Securitisation Repository, INTEX and Bloomberg;  
 
expenses relating to the keeping of the accounting records of the Notes, for their 
admission to trading on any organised secondary market, and for the maintenance 
thereof;  
 
expenses arising from the annual audits of the Fund’s financial statements; 
 
expenses arising from the Rating Agencies fees for the monitoring and maintenance of 
the ratings for the Notes;  
 
expenses arising from the redemption of the Notes; 
 
expenses related to any notices and announcements that, in accordance with the 
provisions of this Prospectus, must be given to the holders of outstanding Notes;  
 
the Paying Agent’s fees, expenses arising from replacement of the Paying Agent when 
removed by the Management Company and the Management Company’s fees; 
 
any part of the PCS fee not paid initially; and 
 
in general, any other expenses borne by the Management Company and arising from 
its duties relating to the representation and management of the Fund. 
Although the actual amount of Ordinary Expenses cannot be determined in advance as it will 
depend on, among others, fixed and variable factors linked to the Outstanding Balance of the 
Receivables, the maximum amount of Ordinary Expenses per year which could be incurred 
by the Fund is estimated in 0.10% of the Outstanding Balance of the Receivables. 
The following items are considered as extraordinary expenses (the “Extraordinary 
Expenses”): 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 – Additional Information 
Page 171 
 
expenses, if any, arising from the preparation and execution of the amendments to the 
Deed of Incorporation and the agreements, and the execution of any additional

expenses required to enforce the Loans and/or the guarantees or security thereunder 
and expenses arising from any recovery actions; and 
 
in general, any other extraordinary expenses borne by the Fund or by the Management 
Company for and on behalf of the Fund. 
3.4.8. 
DETAILS OF ANY OTHER AGREEMENTS AFFECTING THE PAYMENTS OF INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL MADE TO 
THE NOTEHOLDERS 
3.4.8.1. 
Interest Rate Swap Agreement 
General 
On or about the Date of Incorporation, the Management Company, on behalf of the Fund, 
shall enter into the Interest Rate Swap Agreement with the Swap Counterparty in order to 
hedge the potential interest rate exposure of the Fund in relation to its floating rate interest 
obligations under the Notes and match the floating nature of the interest rate payable under 
the Notes and the fixed nature of the interest rate payable under the Loans. The Interest Rate 
Swap Agreement will be drafted in the form of an INTERNATIONAL SWAPS AND DERIVATIVES 
ASSOCIATION (ISDA) 2002 Master Agreement, together with the relevant Schedule, the Credit 
Support Annex, the Confirmation (as these terms are defined in the Interest Rate Swap 
Agreement) and the Novation Agreement (as this term is defined below). 
Pre-hedge 
On the 19th of March 2025, Santander Totta (the “Pre-Hedger”) and the Swap Counterparty 
entered into an interest rate swap transaction, as amended on the 14th of April 2025 (date of 
the second confirmation) in order to fix the maximum interest rate that the Fund will be 
obliged to pay under the Interest Rate Swap Agreement (the “Pre-Hedge Transaction”) at 
a rate equal to 2.05% (the “Pre-Hedge Rate”). 
On the Date of Incorporation, the Pre-Hedger’s contractual position under the Pre-Hedge 
Transaction will be transferred by way of novation in favour of the Fund following the 
execution of a deed of novation agreement subject to Irish law (the “Novation Agreement”), 
and such Pre-Hedge Transaction as novated will be part of and governed by the Interest Rate 
Swap Agreement. If, on the Date of Incorporation, the mark-to-market value of the Pre-
Hedge Transaction is positive for the Pre-Hedger (i.e., if the fixed rate calculated at the date 
of incorporation were to be higher than the Pre-Hedge Rate), the Fund will pay in favour of 
the Pre-Hedger an amount equal to the mark-to-market value of the Pre-Hedge Transaction 
as of the Date of Incorporation (the “Pre-Hedge Novation Amount”) as a compensation for 
such transfer. The mark-to-market cannot be determined as of the date of this Prospectus, 
but it will be determined before or upon the Date of Incorporation and, therefore, depending 
on its determination the Pre-Hedge Novation Amount will affect the definitive amount of the 
Start-up Expenses Loan (as explained in section 3.4.4.1 of the Additional Information). The 
Pre-Hedge Novation Amount is expected to range between ZERO EUROS (€0.00) and ELEVEN 
MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND EUROS (€11,500,000) and will be paid from the 
proceeds of the Start-up Expenses Loan.  
Notwithstanding the above, to the extent that the purpose of the Pre-Hedge Transaction is to 
fix the maximum interest rate that the Fund will be obligated to pay under the Interest Rate 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 – Additional Information 
Page 172 
Swap Agreement at the Pre-Hedge Rate (i.e., 2.05%), if the market rate applicable under the 
Interest Rate Swap Agreement is equal to or lower than the Pre-Hedge Rate, (i) the Pre-
Hedge Transaction will be cancelled, (ii) the Fund will not enter into the Novation Agreement, 
and (iii) no Pre-Hedge Novation Amount will accrue. In such scenario, the Fund shall enter 
into an Interest Rate Swap Agreement with the Swap Counterparty. 
Payments under the Interest Rate Swap Agreement 
The Interest Rate Swap Agreement is structured in a way that, on each Payment Date: 
(a) 
the Swap Counterparty has agreed to pay to the Fund an amount equal to a floating 
rate of EURIBOR 3M: 
(i) 
multiplied by the Notional Amount from time to time (as defined below); 
(ii) 
divided by a count fraction of 360; and 
(iii) 
multiplied by the number of days of the relevant Interest Accrual Period. Such 
amount shall be calculated by the Interest Rate Swap Calculation Agent for each 
Interest Accrual Period. 
By way of exception, the floating rate payable on the First Payment Date will result 
from the linear interpolation of the 3-month EURIBOR rate and the 6-month EURIBOR, 
calculated in the terms set forth in section 4.8.4(b) of the Securities Note. 
(b) 
The Fund has agreed to pay to the Swap Counterparty a fixed rate of 2.05% (unless 
the Pre-Hedge Transaction is cancelled and the Fund does not enter into the Novation 
Agreement as further explained in sub-section “Pre-Hedge” above): 
(i) 
multiplied by the Notional Amount from time to time (as defined below); 
(ii) 
divided by a count fraction of 360; and 
(iii) 
multiplied by the number of days of the relevant Interest Accrual Period. Such 
amount shall be calculated by the Interest Rate Swap Calculation Agent for each 
Interest Accrual Period. 
The final fixed interest rate to be paid by the Fund to the Swap Counterparty according to 
section (b) above shall be reflected in both the Deed of Incorporation and the Confirmation 
to be entered into under the Interest Rate Swap Agreement. 
If EURIBOR 3M (or, in respect of the first Swap Calculation Period, such interpolated rate) is 
below zero (0) in respect of a calculation period, no floor will be applied and the absolute 
value of the relevant negative amount will form part of the amount payable to the Fund in 
respect of such period. 
Payments under the Interest Rate Swap Agreement will be made on a net basis according to 
the terms of the Interest Rate Swap Agreement. Payments to the Fund by the Swap 
Counterparty under the Interest Rate Swap Agreement will be paid into the Cash Flow 
Account. 
The Swap Counterparty will be obliged to make payments under the Interest Rate Swap 
Agreement without any withholding or deduction of taxes unless required by law.  


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 – Additional Information 
Page 173 
Notional Amount 
For these purposes, the notional amount of the Interest Rate Swap Agreement (the “Notional 
Amount”) shall be equal: 
 
on the First Payment Date, to the Outstanding Balance of the Non-Defaulted 
Receivables at the Disbursement Date; 
 
from the First Payment Date (excluded) to the Outstanding Balance of the Non-
Defaulted Receivables on the preceding Determination Date. 
Duration and termination 
The Interest Rate Swap Agreement will remain in full force until the earlier of (i) the Legal 
Maturity Date; and (ii) the date on which the Notional Amount is reduced to zero unless it is 
terminated early by one of the parties thereto in accordance with the terms of the Interest 
Rate Swap Agreement.  
The Interest Rate Swap Agreement shall be fully terminated if the Management, Placement 
and Subscription Agreement is fully terminated in accordance with the provisions of section 
4.2.3 of the Securities Note or if the provisional credit ratings of the Rated Notes are not 
confirmed as final by the Rating Agencies on or prior the Disbursement Date (unless such 
provisional ratings are upgraded). 
In the event that the Interest Rate Swap Agreement is terminated by either party, the amount 
determined pursuant to Section 6(e) of the ISDA Master Agreement of the Interest Rate Swap 
Agreement in Euro may be due to the Fund or to the Swap Counterparty, as applicable. 
Interest Rate Swap Calculation Agent 
The Management Company will act as Interest Rate Swap Calculation Agent of the Interest 
Rate Swap Agreement. 
Collateral 
The Interest Rate Swap Agreement will contain provisions requiring certain remedial actions 
to be taken if a Swap Counterparty Downgrade Event occurs in respect of the Swap 
Counterparty (or, as relevant, its guarantor). Such provisions may include a requirement that 
the Swap Counterparty must post collateral; and/or transfer the Interest Rate Swap 
Agreement to another entity (or, as relevant, its guarantor); and/or procure that a guarantor 
meeting the applicable credit rating guarantees its obligations under the Interest Rate Swap 
Agreement.  
When the Swap Counterparty provides collateral in accordance with the provisions of the 
Interest Rate Swap Agreement (including the Credit Support Annex thereto), such collateral 
or interest thereon will not form part of the Available Funds, save as expressly permitted in 
accordance with section 3.4.7.2 (i) (f) above. 
The Swap Counterparty may only post collateral in the form of cash under the Credit Support 
Annex to the Interest Rate Swap Agreement and any such cash collateral amounts will be 
credited to the Swap Collateral Account. If the Swap Counterparty does not fulfil its payment 
obligations under the Interest Rate Swap Agreement, which gives rise to an event of default, 
upon the termination and close-out of the Interest Rate Swap Agreement, any collateral 
amounts which are not returned to the Swap Counterparty pursuant to the Interest Rate 
Swap Agreement may be used by the Fund to obtain a replacement Interest Rate Swap 
Agreement or to make payments on the Notes, in accordance with the applicable Priority of 
Payments. Any excess collateral amount will be paid directly to the Swap Counterparty outside 
of the ranking of the Pre-Enforcement Priority of Payments detailed in section 3.4.7.2 of this 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 – Additional Information 
Page 174 
Additional Information or the ranking of the Post-Enforcement Priority of Payments detailed 
in section 3.4.7.3 of this Additional Information. 
Early Termination 
The Interest Rate Swap Agreement may be early terminated in accordance with its terms, 
irrespective of whether or not the Notes have been paid in full prior to such termination, upon 
the occurrence of a number of events (which may include without limitation): 
 
certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or reorganisation of the Swap 
Counterparty or the Early Liquidation of the Fund; 
 
failure on the part of the Fund or the Swap Counterparty to make any payment under 
the Interest Rate Swap Agreement; 
 
changes in law resulting in illegality; 
 
amendment of any material terms of the Deed of Incorporation without the prior 
written approval of the Swap Counterparty; 
 
occurrence of a Swap Counterparty Downgrade Event that is not remedied within the 
required timeframe pursuant to the Interest Rate Swap Agreement; and 
 
if at any time the Reference Rate in respect of the Notes is changed as a consequence 
of a Base Rate Modification Event and, as a result, it is different to EURIBOR and the 
Swap Counterparty does not accept the Base Rate Modification proposed pursuant to 
section 4.8.5 (Fallback Provision) of the Securities Note. 
It will constitute a Subordination Event in accordance with section 4.9.2.1 of the Securities 
Note if a Swap Counterparty Downgrade Event occurs in respect of the Swap Counterparty 
(or its guarantor, as applicable) and none of the remedies provided for in the Interest Rate 
Swap Agreement are put in place within the timeframe required thereunder. 
If the Interest Rate Swap Agreement is terminated because of an event of default or a 
termination event specified therein, the amount determined pursuant to Section 6(e) of the 
ISDA Master Agreement of the Interest Rate Swap Agreement may be due to the Fund 
depending on market conditions at the time of termination. This amount will be determined 
by the method described in the Interest Rate Swap Agreement and could be substantial if 
market rates or other conditions have changed materially. The amount may be based on the 
actual cost or market quotations provided by reference entities of the market of the cost of 
entering into an interest rate swap agreement similar to the Interest Rate Swap Agreement 
and the unpaid amounts on or prior to the early termination date. Any early termination 
payment payable by the Fund will be payable in accordance with the applicable Priority of 
Payments. 
If the Interest Rate Swap Agreement is terminated prior to redemption in full of the Notes, 
the Fund will be required to enter into a transaction on similar terms with a new Swap 
Counterparty. Any upfront payment to any replacement Swap Counterparty under the 
Interest Rate Swap Agreement payable by the Fund will be paid directly to the replacement 
Swap Counterparty and not in accordance with the Priority of Payments. 
For further information on the potential consequences arising from an early termination of 
the Interest Rate Swap Agreement, please refer to Risk Factor 1.1.4 (Interest Rate Risk) and 
Risk Factor 1.2.6 (Risk relating to benchmarks and the hedging agreement). 
Swap Replacement Proceeds 
Any Swap Replacement Proceeds received by the Fund from a replacement Swap 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 – Additional Information 
Page 175 
Counterparty will be remitted directly to the Swap Collateral Account and shall be applied in 
payment of any Swap Early Termination Amount to the existing Swap Counterparty under 
the existing Interest Rate Swap Agreement outside of the Pre-Enforcement Priority of 
Payments or, where applicable, the Post-Enforcement Priority of Payments. If the Swap 
Replacement Proceeds are insufficient to pay the Swap Early Termination Amount due to the 
existing Swap Counterparty, any shortfall shall be paid in accordance with the Pre-
Enforcement Priority of Payments or, where applicable, the Post-Enforcement Priority of 
Payments. If the Swap Replacement Proceeds exceed the Swap Early Termination Amount 
due to the existing Swap Counterparty, any excess shall be treated as part of the Available 
Funds or Post-Enforcement Available Funds, as applicable. 
For the purposes of this section: 
“Swap Replacement Proceeds” means any amounts received from a replacement Swap 
Counterparty in consideration for entering into a replacement Interest Rate Swap Agreement.  
“Swap Early Termination Amount” means any payment due to the existing Swap 
Counterparty by the Fund or to the Fund by the existing Swap Counterparty, including interest 
that may accrue thereon, under the existing Interest Rate Swap Agreement in case of early 
termination of the Interest Rate Swap Agreement due to an “event of default” or “termination 
event” under the Interest Rate Swap Agreement.  
The Fund will endeavour but cannot guarantee to find a replacement Swap Counterparty upon 
early termination of the Interest Rate Swap Agreement. 
Rating Downgrade Provision 
In the understanding that the Notes actually obtain the provisional ratings allocated by the 
Rating Agencies as described in section 7.3 of the Securities Note, the Swap Counterparty 
complies with the “Swap Required Ratings” (i.e., Ratings Event I and Ratings Event II 
described below), which at the date of registration of this Prospectus and according with the 
provisional ratings allocated by the Rating Agencies to the Rated Notes would be, in particular, 
the following: 
 
“Ratings Event I” shall occur, with respect to the relevant Rating Agencies, if no 
relevant entity has the ‘Ratings Event I Required Ratings’ as specified below. An entity 
will have Ratings Event I Required Ratings: 
Ratings Event I: thresholds. 
FITCH 
Long-term IDR of A- or above or short-term IDR of F1. 
MDBRS 
A or above. 
 
“Ratings Event II” shall occur, with respect to the relevant Rating Agencies, if no 
relevant entity has the ‘Ratings Event II Required Ratings’ as specified below: 
Ratings Event II: thresholds. 
FITCH 
Long-term IDR of BBB- or above or short-term IDR of F3. 
MDBRS 
BBB or above. 
 
Failure by the Swap Counterparty to maintain the Swap Required Ratings would 
constitute a Swap Counterparty Downgrade Event in relation to the ratings issued by 
each of the Rating Agencies that, if not remedied would constitute an “additional 
termination event” with the Swap Counterparty being the sole affected party. 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 – Additional Information 
Page 176 
Upon the occurrence of a Swap Counterparty Downgrade Event, the Swap Counterparty must 
perform the following actions depending on the type of Swap Counterparty Downgrade Event: 
 
Ratings Event I: the Swap Counterparty for as long as the Ratings Event I is continuing 
will, at its own cost, perform one of the acceptable actions described in the table below. 
 
Ratings Event II: the Swap Counterparty for as long as the Ratings Event II is 
continuing will, at its own cost, perform (a) the required action, and additionally (b) 
one of the acceptable actions described in the table below. 
Ratings Event I and Ratings Event II: required and/or acceptable actions. 
 
Post an amount of collateral as 
calculated for the relevant Rating 
Agency in accordance with the 
provisions of the Credit Support 
Annex 
Obtain a guarantee from 
an institution with a credit 
rating that is acceptable 
for the relevant Rating 
Agency. 
Assign its rights and obligations under the 
Interest Rate Swap Agreement to an 
assignee Swap Counterparty that will have 
to comply with the requirements of each 
Rating Agency as stated in the Interest Rate 
Swap Agreement.

SERVICER 
The Management Company shall be responsible for the servicing and management of the 
Loans in accordance with article 26.1 b) of Law 5/2015. Notwithstanding, it shall be entitled 
to subdelegate such duties to third parties in accordance with article 30.4 of Law 5/2015, 
which shall not affect its liability. Therefore, the Management Company will be kept liable 
even if such duties are delegated to third parties.  
The Management Company will appoint Banco Santander, as Servicer of the Receivables, in 
the Deed of Incorporation to perform the servicing and management of the Loans. The 
relationship between Banco Santander and the Fund will be governed by the provisions of the 
Deed of Incorporation. 
Banco Santander will accept, in the Deed of Incorporation, the mandate received from the 
Management Company to act as servicer of the Loans (the “Servicer”) and will undertake: 
 
to carry out the servicing and management of the Receivables acquired by the Fund, 
as established by the ordinary rules and procedures of servicing and management set 
out in the Deed of Incorporation; 
 
to continue to service the Loans, dedicating the same time and attention and the same 
level of expertise, care and diligence in its administration as it would dedicate and 
exercise in the administration of its own loans. In any case, it will exercise an 
appropriate level of expertise, care and diligence as regards the provision of the 
services stipulated in this Additional Information and in the Deed of Incorporation; 
 
that the procedures it applies and will apply for the servicing and management of the 
Loans that are, and will continue to be, in accordance with applicable laws and 
regulations; 
 
to faithfully comply with the instructions given by the Management Company; 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 – Additional Information 
Page 180 
 
to carry out all actions required to maintain in full force the licenses, approvals, 
authorisations and consents that might be necessary or appropriate in relation to the 
performance of its services;  
 
to have available the equipment and personnel sufficient to carry out all its obligations; 
and 
 
to compensate the Fund for the damages that may derive from failure to comply with 
the obligations assumed. 
A brief description of the ordinary rules and procedures of administration and custody of the 
Loans governed by the Deed of Incorporation of the Fund is set forth in the following sections. 
3.7.1.1. 
Term and replacement of the Servicer 
The services will be provided by the Servicer from the Date of Incorporation until all 
obligations assumed by the Servicer in relation to such Loans are extinguished upon full 
repayment of the Loans, without prejudice to the possible early revocation of its mandate or 
its voluntary resignation, if legally possible. 
Upon the occurrence of an Event of Replacement of the Servicer, the Management Company, 
with prior notice to the Rating Agencies, may take one of the following actions: 
 
replace the Servicer with another entity that, in the opinion of the Management 
Company, has the suitable legal and technical capacity, provided that the rating of the 
Rated Notes or the STS status of the Notes is not adversely affected; 
 
require the Servicer to subcontract, delegate or have the performance of such 
obligations guaranteed by another entity that, in the opinion of the Management 
Company, has the suitable legal and technical capacity, provided that the rating of the 
Rated Notes is not adversely affected. 
In the case of an Insolvency Event occurs in respect of the Servicer, the only possible action 
will be the one described in section (a) above.  
In accordance with Spanish Insolvency Law, the Fund, through the Management Company, 
will have a right of separation in respect of the assigned Receivables, pursuant to articles 239 
and 240 of the Spanish Insolvency Law. This right of separation will not necessarily extend 
to the money received by the Seller, in its capacity as Servicer, and kept by the latter on 
behalf of the Fund prior to its deposit to the account of the Fund, since, given its fungible 
nature, it could be subject to the result of the insolvency proceedings according to the 
majority interpretation of article 240 of the Spanish Insolvency Law. 
The Management Company will take into account the proposals made by the Servicer both in 
connection with the subcontracting, delegation or appointment of the new Servicer for the 
fulfilment of its obligations, and in connection with the entity that could guarantee the 
fulfilment of such obligations.  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the final decision as regards the appointment of the new 
Servicer and any of the aforementioned actions will correspond to the Management Company, 
acting in the name and on behalf of the Fund.  
Upon the occurrence of an Event of Replacement of the Servicer, the Servicer undertakes to 
carry out the following actions: 
 
To make available upon the Management Company’s request a record of the personal 
data of Borrowers necessary to issue collection orders to Borrowers or to have served 
on Borrowers the notice referred to below (the “Personal Data Record” or “PDR”).  


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 – Additional Information 
Page 181 
The communication and use of such data shall be limited and in any event subject to 
compliance with the Organic Law 3/2018, of 5 December, on personal data protection 
and guarantee of digital rights or law replacing, amending or implementing the same 
and the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 
27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of 
personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 
95/46/EC.  
 
Upon the Management Company’s prior request, to deposit the PDR before a public 
notary in order that it may be searched or used in due course by the Management 
Company in case of need in connection with the Loan servicing functions. 
 
To assist the Management Company using all reasonable efforts in the substitution 
process and, as the case may be, notify the Borrowers. 
 
As soon as reasonably practicable, deliver and make available to the Management 
Company (or any person appointed by it) the files delivered to it by the Seller (if 
different from the Servicer), copies of all records (including, without limitation, 
computer records and books of records), correspondence, and documents in its 
possession or under its control relating to the relevant Receivables assigned to the 
Fund and any sums and other assets, if any, then held by the Servicer on behalf of the 
Management Company; 
 
To do such things and execute such contracts as shall require the Servicer’s 
involvement in order for functions to be effectively transferred to the new Servicer. 
The Servicer may, in turn, voluntarily decide not to administer and manage the Receivables, 
if permitted by laws in force from time to time (a “Servicer Voluntarily Withdrawal 
Event”), and provided that (i) it is authorised by the Management Company, (ii) the 
Management Company has appointed a new Servicer which has effectively accepted to start 
carrying out its duties, (iii) the Servicer has indemnified the Fund for any damages caused to 
the Fund by the resignation and replacement (including any additional cost, will not be 
charged to the Fund), and (iv) the rating of the Notes is not adversely affected. 
The assignment of the Receivables to the Fund will not be notified to the Borrowers except if 
required by law except as foreseen in section 3.7.1.12 of this Additional Information. 
For the purposes of this section: 
“Event of Replacement of the Servicer” means the occurrence of any of the following 
events:  
 
any breach of its obligations under the Deed of Incorporation, in the reasonable opinion 
of the Management Company, and in particular, its obligation to transfer to the Fund 
the amounts received from the Borrowers within two (2) Business Days as from receipt 
(except if the breach is due to a force majeure);  
 
an Insolvency Event occurs in respect of the Servicer; or 
 
a Servicer Voluntarily Withdrawal Event occurs. 
“Insolvency Event” means, with respect to any entity, a declaration of insolvency 
(declaración de concurso) in respect thereto. 
3.7.1.2. 
Custody of agreements, deeds, documents and files 
The Servicer will keep all the Loan agreements, as well as copies of all instruments, 
documents and computer files related to the Loans in safe custody and will not abandon the 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 – Additional Information 
Page 182 
possession, custody or control thereof without the prior written consent of the Management 
Company for such purpose, unless the document is necessary to commence proceedings for 
the enforcement of a Loan. 
The Servicer, acting reasonably, will at all times provide the Management Company or the 
duly authorised auditor of the Fund with access to such Loan agreements, instruments, 
documents and records. If the Management Company so requests, the Servicer will also 
provide a free-of-charge copy or photocopy of any of such agreements, instruments and 
documents within five (5) Business Days following such request. The Servicer must act in the 
same way in the case of requests for information from the auditor of the Fund. 
In any case, the Servicer waives the privileges which the law confers thereon in its condition 
as manager of collections for the Fund and of the custody of the Loan agreements, and 
particularly those established in articles 1,730 and 1,780 of the Spanish Civil Code (regarding 
the retention of pledged assets) and 276 of the Spanish Commercial Code (security similar 
to the retention of pledged assets). 
3.7.1.3. 
Collection management 
The Servicer will receive on account of the Fund such amounts as are paid by the Borrowers 
arising out of the Receivables, both for principal or interest, as well as any other concept, and 
will proceed to deposit into the Cash Flow Account, the amounts which pertain to the Fund, 
immediately and in any case within two (2) Business Days following the receipt thereof. 
3.7.1.4. 
Advance of funds 
In no event will the Servicer advance any amount that has not been previously received from 
the Borrowers as principal or an outstanding instalment, interest or financial charge, 
prepayment or other item arising from the Loan. 
3.7.1.5. 
Information 
The Servicer must periodically inform the Management Company and the Rating Agencies of 
the Borrowers’ level of compliance with their obligations arising from the Loans, of the 
compliance by the Servicer with its obligation to deposit the amounts received from the Loans, 
of the actions taken in the event of delay, and of the existence of hidden defects in the Loans. 
The Servicer must prepare and deliver to the Management Company the additional 
information that the Management Company may reasonably request regarding the Loans or 
the rights arising therefrom. 
In particular, the Servicer shall provide in a timely manner to the Originator, as Reporting 
Entity, any reports, data and other information in the correct format to fulfil the reporting 
requirements of articles 7 and 22 of the EU Securitisation Regulation (including, inter alia, 
the information, if available, related to the environmental performance of the vehicles). 
3.7.1.6. 
Subrogation of the Borrower to the Loans 
The Servicer will be authorised to permit subrogations to the position of the Borrower in the 
Loan agreements only in those cases in which the new Borrower has similar features in 
respect of risk profile and others to those of the previous Borrower and such features conform 
to the Loan assignment standards described in section 2.2.7 of this Additional Information, 
and provided that the expenses deriving from such subrogation are paid in full by the new 
Borrower (unless otherwise provided by law). The Management Company may totally or 
partially limit this authority of the Servicer, or subject the power to conditions, if such 
subrogations may negatively affect the ratings of the Rated Notes given by the Rating 
Agencies.

Page 183 
The Management Company must in any case be immediately notified of any subrogation by 
the Servicer in accordance with the preceding paragraph. The subrogation of the Loan must

Powers and actions in relation to Loan forbearance processes

the refinancing or restructuring of the Loans provided for in (i) Bank of Spain Circular

standards and reserved and models of financial statements; and (ii) any circular and/or 
guidelines that may be issued by the EBA in order to better define forbearance 
measures (such renegotiations are not considered as Refinancings or Restructurings 
as they are due to reasons other than financial difficulties) (hereinafter, Commercial 
Renegotiations”), 
in the terms and conditions described below and always provided that such actions do not 
reduce the rank, legal effectiveness or economic value of the Loans. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Servicer will deal with the requests made by the Borrowers 
with the same diligence and procedure as if dealing with other loans held in its balance sheet 
or otherwise administered by the Servicer. 
The Management Company authorises Banco Santander to effect Refinancings or 
Restructurings in compliance with the following requirements: 
 
in order to modify the nominal interest rate of a fixed interest rate Loan, the nominal 
interest rate of the Loan in the Fund once the renegotiation has taken place shall not 
be lower than 6%.  
 
The maximum Outstanding Balance that may be novated in this particular case over 
the life of the Fund may not exceed of 7.5% of the Outstanding Balance of the Loans 
at the Date of Incorporation.  
The powers of effecting any Refinancing or Restructuring given to Banco Santander in this 
section are subject to the following limitations: 
 
no novation from fixed to floating rate is allowed; 
 
under no circumstances may the amount of the Loan be increased; 
 
the frequency of interest payments and repayment of principal on the Loan in question 
must be maintained or increased; 
 
the maturity term of a Loan may be extended provided that the amount of the sum of 
capital or principal assigned to the Fund from Loans whose maturities have been 
extended may not be more than 10% of the initial Outstanding Balance of the Loans 
on the Date of Incorporation; and 
 
the new final maturity date or final repayment of the Loan in question may be no later 
than the Final Maturity Date (i.e., 21 January 2038). 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 – Additional Information 
Page 184 
The limits set forth above in connection with the powers of renegotiation given to Banco 
Santander shall not apply (and thus, are expressly allowed in any event): 
 
in the event of implementation of any Moratorium, or 
 
in the events qualifying as Commercial Renegotiations. 
For these purposes, “Moratoriums” means any (i) settlement, suspension of payments, 
rescheduling of the amortisation plan or other contractual amendments resulting from or 
arising from mandatory provisions, or (ii) voluntary moratoriums or deferment of payments, 
together with any decisions or recommendations of public authorities or conventions, 
arrangements or recommendations of institutional or industry associations. 
In any event, after any refinancing, restructuring, renewal or renegotiation takes place in 
accordance with the provisions of this section, the Servicer will immediately inform the 
Management Company of the terms and conditions resulting from each of the aforementioned 
transactions. 
The Management Company, on behalf of the Fund, may, at any time, suspend or amend the 
authorisation and requirements for forbearance by the Servicer set forth in this section. 
3.7.1.8. 
Exceptional expenses 
On each Payment Date the Servicer will be reimbursed for all exceptional expenses incurred 
in the servicing of the Receivables and the Loans and which have been duly justified to the 
Management Company, including any expenses arising from the enforcement of the security 
or guarantees but expressly excluding any extrajudicial expenses. 
Such exceptional expenses will be paid in accordance with the Pre-Enforcement Priority of 
Payments and the Post-Enforcement Priority of Payments set forth in sections 3.4.7.2 and 
3.4.7.3 of this Additional Information, respectively.  
3.7.1.9. 
Set-off 
In the exceptional event that any of the Borrowers has a liquid, due and payable credit right 
against the Servicer, with the result that one or more of the Loans are set off against such 
right, the Servicer will remedy this circumstance such that the set-off does not apply, or if it 
is not possible to remedy it, the Servicer will deposit in the Cash Flow Account the amount 
which was set off plus the interest due from the date of set-off until the date on which the 
deposit is made, calculated in accordance with the terms and conditions applicable to the 
corresponding Loan. 
3.7.1.10. 
Subcontracting 
The Servicer may subcontract any of the services which it has undertaken to provide by virtue 
of the above provisions and those of the Deed of Incorporation, except for those services that 
cannot be delegated pursuant to applicable law. In no case will such subcontracting entail 
any additional cost or expense for the Fund or the Management Company, and it must not 
cause a downgrade of the rating of the Rated Notes by the Rating Agencies.  
Notwithstanding any subcontracting or delegation, (i) the Management Company shall not be 
excused or released under the subcontract or subdelegation from any of the liabilities 
assumed under article 26.1.b) of Law 5/2015, and (ii) the Servicer will not be discharged or 
released through such subcontracting or delegation from any of the liabilities assumed and 
that are legally attributable to or enforceable against the Servicer. 
3.7.1.11. 
Liability of the Servicer and indemnity 
Banco Santander, as Servicer: 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 – Additional Information 
Page 185 
 
undertakes to act with due diligence as regards the collection management for the 
Loans as well as the custody and administration of the Loans and will be liable to the 
Fund, through its Management Company, for any damage that arises from its 
negligence; 
 
will indemnify the Fund, through its Management Company, for any damage, loss or 
expense it may incur due to the failure to comply with its obligations concerning 
collection management and/or custody and/or administration of the Loans; and 
 
does not assume liability in any form as regards directly or indirectly guaranteeing the 
success of the transaction, nor will it provide security or enter into agreements for the 
repurchase of the Receivables other than in accordance with the terms and conditions 
set forth in section 2.2.9 of this Additional Information.  
Neither the Noteholders nor any other creditor of the Fund shall have any direct right of action 
whatsoever against the Servicer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, under article 26.1.b) and 
26.2 of Law 5/2015, the Management Company shall be liable to the Noteholders and other 
creditors of the Fund for any and all losses caused them by a breach of its obligation to service 
and manage the Receivables pooled in the Fund. 
3.7.1.12. 
Notices 
The Management Company and the Seller have agreed to not notify the assignment of the 
Receivables to the respective Borrowers except when required by law that as of the Date of 
Incorporation of the Fund, involves the Borrowers of the Autonomous Communities of 
Valencia, Castilla-La Mancha and Comunidad Foral de Navarra, according to, respectively: 
 
Decree-Law 1/2019, of December 13, of the Consell, approving the consolidated 
version of the Statute of consumers and users of the Valencian Community (Decreto 
Legislativo 1/2019, de 13 de diciembre, del Consell, de aprobación del texto refundido 
de la Ley del Estatuto de las personas consumidoras y usuarias de la Comunitat 
Valenciana); 
 
Law 3/2019, of March 22, approving the Statute of consumers in Castilla La Mancha 
(Ley 3/2019, de 22 de marzo, del Estatuto de las Personas Consumidoras en Castilla-
La Mancha); and 
 
Regional Law 21/2019, of 4 April, on the modification and updating of the Navarra’s 
regional civil law compilation or “Fuero Nuevo” (Ley Foral 21/2019, de 4 de abril, de 
modificación y actualización de la Compilación del Derecho Civil Foral de Navarra o 
Fuero Nuevo). 
For these purposes, notice is not a requirement for the validity of the assignment of the 
Receivables. If the Seller does not notify the assignment in accordance with the 
abovementioned regulations, it may be subject to sanctions foreseen in such regulation which 
will not affect the assignment of the Receivables subject to the Spanish Civil Code. 
Notwithstanding the above, in the event of insolvency, liquidation, intervention by the Bank 
of Spain or substitution of the Seller, or upon the occurrence of an Event of Replacement of 
the Servicer, or if the Management Company considers it to be reasonably justified, the 
Management Company may request the Servicer to notify the Borrowers of the assignment 
of the outstanding Receivables to the Fund and that the payments derived therefrom will only 
release the debt if payment is made into the Cash Flow Account opened in the name of the 
Fund. However, if the Servicer has not given the notice to the Borrowers within five (5) 
Business Days of receipt of the request by the Management Company, or in the case that the 
Servicer is in insolvency proceedings, the Management Company itself, either directly or 
through a new designated servicer or agent, may notify the Borrowers.  


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 – Additional Information 
Page 186 
Accordingly, the Seller will grant to the Management Company in the Deed of Incorporation 
the broadest powers as required by law so that it may, in the name of the Fund, notify the 
Borrowers of the assignment at the time it deems appropriate.  
The Seller will assume the expenses incurred in notifying the Borrowers, even if notification 
is provided by the Management Company. 
3.7.1.13. 
Servicer’s remuneration 
As consideration for being in charge of the custody, administration and management of the 
Loans, the Servicer shall have the right to receive in arrears on each Payment Date an 
administration fee (the “Servicer’s Fee”), including VAT, if there is no exemption available, 
equal to SIX THOUSAND EUROS (€6,000). 
If the Fund, through its Management Company, does not pay the entire Servicer’s Fee on a 
Payment Date due to the lack of sufficient liquidity in accordance with the Pre-Enforcement 
Priority of Payments, any unpaid amounts shall be added –without any kind of penalty– to 
the fee to be paid on the following Payment Date.  
On the other hand, the Servicer, on each Payment Date, shall be entitled to the 
reimbursement of all exceptional expenses incurred in connection with the administration of 
the Receivables, subject to their justification to the Management Company. Such expenses 
shall include, inter alia, those arising from the enforcement of the security or guarantees but 
expressly excluding any extrajudicial expenses, and they shall be paid provided that the Fund 
has sufficient liquidity in accordance with the Pre-Enforcement Priority of Payments. 
3.7.1.14. 
Servicer Event Reserve 
A “Servicer Event Reserve Trigger” means the occurrence of any of the following events: 
 
the rating of the Servicer, at any time during the life of the Notes issue, is downgraded 
below (x) A- (senior unsecured rating), according to Fitch or (y) BBB (senior unsecured 
rating), according to MDBRS; or 
 
an Event of Replacement of the Servicer. 
Action required 
Banco Santander shall, within sixty (60) calendar days immediately following the occurrence 
of the Servicer Event Reserve Trigger, deposit in the Cash Flow Account an amount equal to 
(the “Servicer Event Reserve Amount”): 
 
one per cent (1%) of the Outstanding Balance of the Receivables calculated on the 
Determination Date immediately preceding the relevant Payment Date; multiplied by 
 
the weighted average life of the Outstanding Balance of the Receivables calculated on 
the same Determination Date, assuming a 0.0% CPR and a 0.0% CDR. 
Use of the Servicer Event Reserve Amount 
The Servicer Event Reserve Amount will form part of the Available Funds for the sole purpose 
of financing the Servicer’s Fee if there is a replacement of Banco Santander as Servicer, as 
set forth in section 3.4.7.4 of the Additional Information. 
Release of the Servicer Event Reserve Amount 
On each Payment Date, and once the Servicer’s Fee has been paid in accordance with the 
relevant Priority of Payments, the Servicer Event Reserve Amount will be reduced outside of 
the relevant Priority of Payments and will be directly returned to Banco Santander for an 


F.T. Santander Consumo 8 – Additional Information 
Page 187 
amount equal to the difference of the Servicer Event Reserve Amount between two relevant 
Payment Dates.

Incorporation), to Bank of Spain as competent authority and, upon request, to potential 
investors.

notice to the Management Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such resignation 
will not become effective until a new entity has been designated to replace it in 
accordance with article 7.2 of the EU Securitisation Regulation. 
Any failure by the Originator to fulfil such obligations may cause the transaction to be 
non-compliant with the EU Securitisation Regulation.  
The breach of the transparency obligations under article 7 of the EU Securitisation 
Regulation may lead to pecuniary sanctions being imposed on the Fund (or eventually, 
the Management Company, acting on behalf of the Fund) or the Seller (as originator) 
pursuant to article 32 of the EU Securitisation Regulation and article 38 of Law 5/2015 
(as amended by the Securities Market Act), without prejudice of the potential effect on 
the STS status of this transaction. 
If a regulator determines that the transaction did not comply or is no longer in 
compliance with the reporting obligations, then investors may be required by their 
regulator to set aside additional capital against their investment in the Notes or take 
other remedial measures in respect of their investment in the Notes. The Fund (or 
eventually, the Management Company, acting on behalf of the Fund) and/or the Seller 
(as originator) may be subject to administrative sanctions in the case of negligence or 
intentional infringement of the disclosure requirements, including pecuniary sanctions.  
Any such pecuniary sanctions imposed on the Fund (or eventually, the Management 
Company, acting on behalf of the Fund) may materially adversely affect the Fund’s 
ability to perform its obligations under the Notes and any such pecuniary sanction 
levied on the Seller (as originator) may materially adversely affect the ability of the 
Seller to perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents and could have a 
negative impact on the price and liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market. 
Each prospective investor is required to independently assess and determine the 
sufficiency of the information described above for the purposes of complying with 
article 5 of the EU Securitisation Regulation and none of Banco Santander (in its

the Joint Lead Managers, makes any representation that the information described 
above is sufficient in all circumstances for such purposes.
