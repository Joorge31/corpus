RRIISSKK  FFAACCTTO
ORRSS  
 
1. 
RISKS DERIVING FROM THE LEGAL STATUS AND BUSINESS OF THE ISSUER 
a) 
Nature of the Fund and obligations of the Gestora 
The Fund constitutes a separate capital base without legal personality that, in accordance with 
Royal Decree 926/1998 and Law 19/1992, of 7 July 1992, regulating Real Estate Investment 
Funds and Companies and Mortgage Backed Securitisation Funds (Sociedades y Fondos de 
Inversión Inmobiliaria y sobre Fondos de Titulización Hipotecaria), is managed by a 
management company (sociedad gestora). The Fund will only meet the financial liabilities to its 
creditors with its capital. 
The capacity of the Fund to comply with the obligations for payment of principal and interest 
deriving from the Bonds, as well as their operating and administrative expenses, principally 
depends on the revenues received on the Mortgage Loans. 
The Bonds will not be guaranteed, nor will they be considered to be obligations or liabilities of 
any entity other than the Fund. 
The Gestora will carry out for the Fund those functions attributed to it in Royal Decree 
926/1998 and Law 19/1992 and protect the interests of the holders of the Bonds as manager of 
third party funds, without the existence of a bondholders syndicate. The capacity to defend the 
Bondholders’ interests will thus depend on the Gestora. 
b) 
Mandatory substitution of the Gestora 
In accordance with articles 18 and 19 of Royal Decree 926/1998, if bankruptcy proceedings are 
declared for the Gestora it shall find a management company to replace it. In this case there is 
no guarantee that a substitute management company with appropriate experience will be 
found. This may delay the handling of payments on the Mortgage Loans and ultimately 
negatively affect payment of the Bonds. 
 
If four months have elapsed without a new management company being found that is prepared 
to assume responsibility for the management function, the Fund will be liquidated early and the 
securities it has issued will be redeemed, in accordance with the provisions of the Deed of 
Establishment and in this Prospectus. 
c) 
Limitation of action 
 
 
10 


 
The Bondholders and remaining creditors of the Fund will have no recourse against the obligors 
of the Mortgage Loans that have breached their payment obligations thereunder. Only the 
Gestora, as the representative of the Fund holding the Participaciones Hipotecarias (mortgage 
participations; hereinafter, “PHs”), may take that action.  
The Bondholders and remaining creditors of the Fund will have no recourse against the Fund or 
against the Gestora in the event of non-payment of amounts owed by the Fund as a result of: 
(i) non-performance or early redemption of the PHs, (ii) default of the counterparties to 
transactions undertaken in the name and for the account of the Fund or (iii) insufficiency of the 
protective financial transactions to meet the financial servicing requirements of the Bonds of 
each Class.  
The Bondholders and remaining creditors of the Fund will have no recourse against Barclays 
Bank, S.A. or against the Gestora, respectively, other than the recourse deriving from breaches 
of their respective responsibilities and, therefore, never as a result of non-performance or 
prepayment of the Mortgage Loans. 
d) 
Applicability of the Insolvency Law 
Both Barclays Bank, S.A. and the Gestora and any of the remaining participants in the 
transaction may be declared to be insolvent. The insolvency of any of the participants may 
affect contractual relationships with the Fund. 
If Barclays Bank, S.A. is declared to be insolvent under Insolvency Law 22/2003 of 9 July 2003, 
the Fund, acting through the Gestora, will have the right of withdrawal in relation to the 
multiple security certificate representing the PHs, on the terms provided in articles 80 and 81 of 
the Insolvency Law. In addition, the Fund, acting through its Gestora, will have the right to 
obtain from Barclays Bank, S.A. the amounts resulting from the PHs from the date of 
declaration of insolvency, given that those sums shall be considered property of the Fund, 
through the Gestora, and will therefore be transferred to the Gestora on behalf of the Fund. 
This right of withdrawal will not necessarily extend the money that Barclays Bank, S.A. may 
have received and maintained for the account of the Fund prior to that date, given that it could 
be a part of the insolvency proceeds, in accordance with the majority interpretation of article 80 
of the applicable Insolvency Law, because of the essential fungible nature of money. The 
mechanisms mitigating this risk are described in sections 3.4.4.1 (Treasury Account), 3.4.5 
(Collection by the Fund of payments relating to the assets) and 3.7.2.1 (Collections 
management) of the Additional Building Block. 
 
 
 
11 


 
In the event of insolvency of the Gestora, it must be replaced by another management 
company in accordance with the provisions of article 19 of Royal Decree 926/1998 and the 
provisions of paragraph 1b) of this Document. 
e) 
Information from third parties 
The Fund has signed agreements with third parties to provide certain services related to the 
Bonds. These include the Administration Agreement, the Agreement for Subordinated Loan for 
Set Up Expenses, the Agreement for Subordinated Loan for Establishment of the Reserve Fund, 
the Interest Rate Swap Agreement, the Financial Services Agreement, and the Underwriting 
Agreement. 
The Bondholders may be harmed if any of the referenced parties breaches the obligations 
assumed under any of the foregoing agreements. 
2. 
RISKS DERIVING FROM THE SECURITIES 
a) 
Liquidity 
There is no guarantee that the Bonds will be traded on the market with a minimum frequency 
or volume.  
There is no undertaking of any entity to intervene in the secondary market providing liquidity to 
the Bonds by offering itself as counterparty.  
Also, in no circumstances will the Fund be able to repurchase the Bonds from the Bondholders, 
although they can be redeemed early in their totality in the case of the Early Liquidation of the 
Fund on the terms established in section 4.4.3 of the Registration Document. 
b) 
Profitability 
The profitability of the Bonds upon maturity will depend among other factors on the amount 
and date of payment of principal on the PHs and the price paid by the holders of each Class of 
Bonds. 
Performance by the obligor of the terms agreed upon in the Mortgage Loans (for example the 
repayment of principal, payments of interest) is influenced by a variety of geographical, 
economic and social factors such as seasonality, market interest rates, the availability of 
financing alternatives, the propensity of owners to change residence, the labour and economic 
status of the obligors and the general level of economic activity. The performance is therefore 
unpredictable. 
 
 
12 


 
The calculation of the internal rate of return, average life and duration of the Bonds set out in 
the Prospectus is subject, among others, to the assumptions set out in section 4.10 of the 
Securities Note regarding anticipated prepayment and non-performance rates for the Mortgage 
Loans that may not be prove to be true, and also regarding future market interest rates, given 
the floating nature of the nominal interest rate of each Class. 
c) 
Duration 
The calculation of the average life and duration of the Bonds of each Class set out in section 
4.10 of the Securities Note is subject to timely and proper repayment of the Mortgage Loans 
and to the estimates that may or may not be fulfilled regarding the rate of prepayment of the 
Mortgage Loans. 
d) 
Default interest 
Under no circumstances will the delay of the payment of interest or repayment of principal to 
the Bondholders give rise to the accrual of default interest in their favour. 
e) 
Subordination of the Bonds 
Class A2 Bonds are deferred in the repayment of principal with respect to Class A1 Bonds, while 
the interest on both Classes will be paid on a pro rata basis. For their part, Class B Bonds are 
deferred in the payment of interest and repayment of principal with respect to Class A1 and A2 
Bonds, while Class C Bonds in turn are deferred in payment of interest and repayment of 
principal with respect to Class A1, A2 and B Bonds (except as provided in section 4.9.2.5 of the 
Securities Note with respect to pro rata redemption of principal of Classes A2, B and C). 
Nevertheless, there is no assurance that these subordination rules protect the Class A1, A2, B 
and C Bondholders from the risk of a total loss. 
The subordination rules among the various Classes are established in the Order of Priority of 
Payments and in the Fund Liquidation Order of Priority of Payments in accordance with section 
3.4.6 of the Additional Building Block. 
f) 
Deferral of interest 
This Prospectus and the rest of the complementary documentation regarding the Bonds 
contemplate the deferral of payment of interest on the Class B and C Bonds upon the 
occurrence of any of the circumstances described in section 3.4.6 of the Additional Building 
Block and the exceptional rules contemplated therein. 
 
 
13 


 
Interest on Class A1 and A2 Bonds is not subject to these deferral rules. 
g) 
Rating of the Bonds 
The credit risk of the Bonds issued against the Fund has been evaluated by the following rating 
entities: Standard and Poor’s España S.A., Moody’s Investors Service España S.A. and Fitch 
Ratings España S.A.U. 
The final ratings assigned may be revised, suspended or withdrawn at any time by the rating 
entities in light of any information becoming known to them. 
These ratings are not and in no way may be interpreted as being an invitation, 
recommendation or encouragement addressed to investors to engage in any kind of transaction 
regarding the Bonds and, in particular, to acquire, maintain, encumber or sell the Bonds. 
3. 
RISKS DERIVING FROM THE ASSETS BACKING THE ISSUE 
a) 
Risk of non-payment of PHs 
In accordance with article 5.8 of Law 19/1992, the holders of Bonds issued against the Fund 
will bear the risk of non-payment of the PHs contained therein. 
Barclays Bank, S.A., as the Seller, assumes no liability whatever for non-payment by the 
obligors, whether of principal, interest or any other amount they may owe under the Mortgage 
Loans. Barclays Bank, S.A. only bears liability to the Fund for the existence and legitimacy of 
the Mortgage Loans, as well as for the personality with which it executes their transfer. Nor 
does it in any other way assume any responsibility directly or indirectly to guarantee the 
success of the transaction, nor does it grant guarantees or surety bonds, nor enter into 
repurchase agreements for the Mortgage Loans, except for the commitments set out in section 
2.2.9 of the Additional Building Block regarding replacement of the Mortgage Loans that, at the 
time of establishment of the Fund, do not conform to the representations contained in section 
2.2.8 of the Additional Building Block. 
The Bonds issued by the Fund neither represent nor constitute an obligation of Barclays Bank, 
S.A. nor of the Gestora. No other guarantees have been granted by any public or private 
entities, including Barclays Bank, S.A., the Gestora or any other company affiliated with or 
invested in by any of the above. 
 
 
14 


 
b) 
Limited protection 
An investment in the Bonds can be affected, amongst other factors, by a worsening of the 
general economic conditions with a negative effect on the payments of the Mortgage Loans 
that back the Issue of the Bonds of the Fund. In the event that non-payment of the Mortgage 
Loans reaches a high level, the limited protection enjoyed by the Bonds against losses in the 
portfolio of Mortgage Loans as a result of the credit enhancements described in section 3.4.2 of 
the Additional Building Block could be reduced, or even exhausted. Similarly, the degree of 
subordination of interest payments and repayment of principal between the Bonds of the 
different Classes constitutes a differentiated protection mechanism between the different 
Classes. 
c) 
Risk of prepayment of the PHs 
The PHs pooled in the Fund will be prepaid when the obligors prepay the unmatured principal 
of the Mortgage Loans, or if Barclays Bank, S.A. is subrogated with respect to the 
corresponding Mortgage Loans by another financial entity authorised to do so or by virtue of 
any other cause producing the same effect. 
The risk implied by such prepayment will be transferred quarterly, on each Payment Date, to 
the Bondholders by means of partial redemption of the Bonds, in accordance with the 
provisions of the rules for Distribution of Funds Available for Redemption as set out in section 
4.9.2 of the Securities Note.   
The rate of prepayment of the Mortgage Loans depends on a wide range of economic, social 
and other factors. For example, obligors may prepay their loans when they refinance their 
loans, or sell the properties (whether voluntarily or as a consequence of a mortgage foreclosure 
against them). It is not possible to determine the prepayment rate that will be experienced by 
the portfolio.

The Gestora states that the content of the Deed of Establishment will be consistent with the 
draft Deed of Establishment that has been delivered to the CNMV, and with this Prospectus. 
The terms of the Deed of Establishment will not contradict, modify, alter or invalidate the rules

agency, or prior authorisation if necessary, and notice to the Rating Agencies, provided that

4.4.2 Length of Life of the Fund 
The life of the Fund will commence on the date of grant of the Deed of Establishment. 
The duration of the Fund will be until 15 September 2038 or, if that is not a Business Day, the

contemplated in section 4.4.3 of this Registration Document or any of the events of termination 
provided for in section 4.4.4 of this Registration Document has occurred.  
4.4.3 Early Liquidation of the Fund 
In all cases of prepayment included in section 4.9.3.6 of the Securities Note, once the Fund has 
been liquidated and within a maximum term of six (6) months reckoned from the distribution of 
 
 
18 


 
the Fund assets following the Fund Liquidation Order of Priority of Payments (contemplated in 
section 3.4.6 of the Additional Building Block) and the exceptional rules (contemplated in the 
same section 3.4.6 of the Additional Building Block), the Gestora will grant a notarial document, 
which it will send to the CNMV, containing: 
(i) 
the causes, contemplated in the Deed of Establishment and the Prospectus, underlying 
the termination of the Fund; 
(ii) 
the procedure for notice to the Bondholders and the CNMV of early redemption of the 
outstanding Bonds; and 
(iii) 
the distribution of the amounts available in the Fund following the Fund Liquidation Order 
of Priority of Payments contemplated in section 3.4.6 of the Additional Building Block and 
the exceptional rules contemplated in the same section 3.4.6 of the Additional Building 
Block. 
The Gestora will publish those declarations in a newspaper of national circulation and will take 
the other applicable administrative steps. 
The following are necessary requirements for early liquidation of the Fund: 
(i) 
That the payment obligations deriving from the Bonds issued against the Fund may be 
fully covered and paid (if the Gestora decides upon early liquidation of the Fund and 
payment of less than 10% of the initial balance of the PHs remains unpaid). 
Payment obligations deriving from the Bonds on the date of early liquidation of the Fund 
will be the Outstanding Principal Balance on that date plus interest accrued and not paid 
up to the date of prepayment, including any applicable withholdings, which amounts will 
be considered to be due and enforceable for all legal purposes on that date. 
(ii) 
That the Bondholders be notified in the manner contemplated in section 4.1 of the 
Additional Building Block, thirty (30) Business Days in advance, of the decision of the 
Gestora regarding early liquidation of the Fund. 
That notice, which must previously have been made known to the CNMV, must contain a 
description (i) of the reason or reasons for early liquidation of the Fund, (ii) of the procedure to 
be implemented, as described in the following section and (iii) of the manner in which the 
payment obligations deriving from the Bonds will be covered and paid. 
 
 
19 


 
In order to effect early liquidation of the Fund and early redemption of the Bond issue upon 
satisfaction of the requirements indicated in this section, and in order for the Fund, if 
applicable, to have sufficient liquidity to pay the Outstanding Principal Balance of the Bonds 
plus interest accrued and not paid up to the date of redemption, the Gestora, on behalf of and 
for the account of the Fund: 
(i) 
will sell the PHs at a price not less than market price. For these purposes, the Gestora 
must solicit offers from at least five (5) of the entities most active in the purchase and 
sale of mortgage market assets. The Gestora will not be permitted to sell them at a price 
less than the best offer received. Barclays Bank, S.A. will have a pre-emptive right to 
acquire all (but not part) of those PHs, on the conditions fixed by the Gestora and in any 
event at a price equal to or greater than the highest of those offered by the aforesaid 
entities. In order to exercise that pre-emptive right, Barclays Bank, S.A. will have a term 
of ten (10) Business Days after the date the Gestora notifies it of the conditions on which 
it will transfer the PHs. This pre-emptive right in no event implies an agreement or 
declaration of repurchase of the PHs by Barclays Bank, S.A.; 
(ii) 
will cancel the contracts which are not necessary for the liquidation of the Fund; 
(iii) 
whether by reason of insufficiency of the foregoing actions or the existence of remaining 
assets, will sell the other Fund assets. The Gestora will be authorised to accept any offers 
which in its judgement cover the market value of the asset in question and which are 
paid for in cash. By way of exception, it may accept deferral of payments for a term not 
greater than two (2) years. In order to fix the market value, the Gestora may obtain any 
valuation reports it deems necessary. Barclays Bank, S.A. will have a pre-emptive right to 
acquire the remaining assets of the Fund with preference over third parties. The Gestora, 
on behalf of and for the account of the Fund, will send Barclays Bank, S.A. a list of the 
assets and offers received from third parties, and the latter may exercise its right with 
respect to all of the assets offered by the Gestora, within the thirty (30) days following 
receipt of the notice, provided that the offers are at least equal to the best of those 
made by third parties. 
Once the reserve for extraordinary expenses referred to in section 4.4.4 of the Securities 
Registration Document has been funded, the Gestora, will immediately apply all amounts 
that have been obtained from sale of Fund assets to payment of the various items, in the 
form, amount and Fund Liquidation Order of Priority of Payments as appropriate under 
section 3.4.6 of the Additional Building Block and the exceptional rules contemplated in 
the same section 3.4.6 of the Additional Building Block. 
 
 
20 


 
4.4.4 Termination of the Fund 
The termination of the Fund will occur by reason of full redemption of the PHs pooled in it, by 
reason of the early liquidation procedure indicated in section 4.4.3 above and in the event of 
the occurrence of any of the causes of termination set out in the Prospectus, which are listed 
below: 
(i) 
when the PHs are fully redeemed; 
(ii) 
when any of the Rating Agencies does not confirm the provisional rating given to the 
Bonds prior to commencement of the Subscription Period; 
(iii) 
when the Gestora decides on early liquidation of the Fund because less than 10% of the 
initial balance of the portfolio of PHs remains pending payment, provided that the early 
redemption of the PHs, together with the balance then existing in the Treasury Account 
and, if applicable, in the Cash Surplus Account, allows full payment of all pending 
obligations to Bondholders, respecting payments ranked higher in the Order of Priority of 
Payments described in section 3.4.6 of the Additional Building Block and the exceptional 
rules contemplated therein. 
(iv) 
when any exceptional event or circumstance not foreseen on the Date of Establishment 
permanently distorts the financial equilibrium of the Fund required by Law 19/1992, for 
reasons external to the development of the Fund itself, such as new rules or 
complementary legislative developments, withholdings or other situations that may 
permanently affect that equilibrium; 
(v) 
when there is non-payment indicating a serious and permanent imbalance with respect 
to any of the Bonds or it is foreseeable that such non-payment will occur; 
(vi) 
when the Bonds are fully redeemed (not later than the Final Maturity Date); or 
(vii) 
in the event of early liquidation of the Fund and redemption of the Bonds if the Gestora is 
declared subject to insolvency proceedings or its authorisation is revoked and a new 
management company is not appointed within a term of four months. 
If during the liquidation of the Fund there is any remainder after making all payments through 
distribution of the available funds in accordance with the Fund Liquidation Order of Priority of 
Payments established in section 3.4.6 of the Additional Building Block and the exceptional rules 
contemplated therein, it will be paid to Barclays Bank, S.A. If the remainder is not comprised of 
liquid amounts because it corresponds to PHs pending resolution of judicial or notarial 
 
 
21 


 
proceedings initiated as a consequence of non-payment by the obligor under the Mortgage 
Loans, as contemplated in section 3.7.2.1, paragraph 9 of the Additional Building Block, both 
the continuation and the proceeds of resolution will be in favour of Barclays Bank, S.A. 
The Gestora will not extinguish the Fund and cancel its registration with the corresponding 
governmental registries until the remaining Fund assets have been liquidated and the Available 
Funds thereof have been distributed following the Fund Liquidation Order of Priority of 
Payments under section 3.4.6 of the Additional Building Block and the exceptional rules 
contemplated therein, except for the appropriate reserve to pay the final expenses of 
extinction.

The Underwriters assume the obligations contained in the Underwriting Agreement, namely: (i) 
to subscribe for the Bonds which have not been subscribed for once the Subscription Period has 
ended, up to the amounts established for each; (ii) to pay into the account held at the Bank of 
Spain by the Financial Agent, Barclays Bank, S.A., the amount of the issue underwritten by 
each Underwriter after deducting the amount of the agreed underwriting fee, before 11:00 a.m. 
Madrid time on the Closing Date, for value that same day; (iii) to provide subscribers with a 
document accrediting their subscription; and (iv) other aspects governing underwriting and 
distribution. 
The Underwriters will receive an underwriting fee of 0.10% of the total nominal amount of the 
Bonds they have underwritten by virtue of the Underwriting Agreement to be entered into by 
the Gestora acting for and on behalf of the Fund. This fee will be paid by the Fund on the 
Closing Date, by its deduction from the amount underwritten which each Underwriter will pay 
the Financial Agent in the account open at the Bank of Spain in the name of Barclays Bank. 
S.A., in accordance with the provisions of the Underwriting Agreement. 
The underwriting commitment envisaged here is provisional and conditional on the Gestora, the 
Lead Manager and the Underwriters reaching an agreement on the final margins applicable to 
 
 
40 


 
the Bond Classes prior to the start of the Subscription Period. If such an agreement is not 
forthcoming (or if the Underwriting Agreement is cancelled due to the invoking of one of the 
conditions for termination indicated below), the Underwriters who disagree with the margins 
established (or who invoke one of the conditions for termination indicated below) shall be freed 
of their commitments and the Gestora shall be authorised to fix the final margins itself. In this 
event, Barclays Bank S.A. promises to underwrite (and, if applicable, to place) the subscription 
of those Bonds which the Underwriter or Underwriters in disagreement or which has or have 
invoked one of the conditions for termination indicated below had pledged to underwrite, in 
exchange for an underwriting fee of 0.10% of the total nominal amount of the Bonds 
underwritten. If this is the case, the Gestora will inform the CNMV that finally Barclays Bank, 
S.A. will act as Underwriter by virtue of this underwriting commitment. 
The Underwriting Agreement includes resolutory conditions which may be invoked by the 
Underwriters and which would result in Barclays Bank, S.A. taking on the underwriting 
commitments. These conditions, in addition to disagreement over the fixing of margins referred 
to above, refer to the following matters: (i) the occurrence of any material adverse change or 
of any event which may give rise to a material adverse change in the situation (financial or 
otherwise) of the Fund, of the Mortgage Loans or of the PHs since the date of subscription of 
the Underwriting Agreement, or the occurrence of any event or circumstance which may give 
rise to certain of the representations and warranties contained therein being materially false or 
incorrect on the Closing Date, and (ii) if in the opinion of Barclays Bank PLC, acting through its 
investment banking division Barclays Capital, on behalf of all the Underwriters, a change has 
occurred in the national and international financial, political or economic situation, or in 
exchange rates or in the control of foreign investments which may significantly prejudice the 
success of the distribution and offer of the Bonds or the trading of the Bonds on the secondary 
market. 
The Underwriting Agreement is subject to English law. The Underwriting and Management 
Agreement by virtue of which Barclays Bank, S.A. would act as Underwriter in the 
circumstances described in this section and, independently of the occurrence of said 
circumstances, as Lead Manager, shall be subject to Spanish law. 
Barclays Bank, S.A. will act as Lead Manager in the Bond issue. Barclays Bank, S.A. will receive 
a total management fee of 0.01% of the nominal amount of the Bond issue.

4.2. Description of the type and class of the securities 
The bonds enjoy the legal status of marketable fixed-income securities with explicit returns, 
and are subject to the regime provided by the Spanish Securities Market Law and its 
implementing regulations. 
4.3. Legislation under which the securities have been created 
The establishment of the Fund and the issue of the Bonds are subject to Spanish legislation 
and, specifically, to: (i) Law 19/1992, of 7 July 1992, governing Real Estate Investment 
Companies and Funds and Mortgage Securitisation Funds; (ii) Law 24/1988, of 28 July 1988, on 
the Securities Market, modified by Law 37/1998, of 16 November 1998, Law 44/2002, of 22 
November 2002, and Royal Decree 5/2005, among others, and the applicable implementing 
provisions; (iii) Commission Regulation (EC) 809/2004 of 29 April 2004; (iv) Royal Decree 
926/1998 and its implementing regulations, and (vi) the rest of the applicable legal and 
regulatory provisions in force from time to time. 
According to the Ministerial Order of 30 December 1992, on solvency standards for credit 
institutions, and the Ministerial Order of 29 December 1992, on capital and supervision on a 
consolidated basis of securities dealer firms and broker firms and their groups, both as 
amended by the Ministerial Order of 13 April 2000 and, inter alia, the first by the Order of 27 
December 2002, and the second by the Order of 8 January 2003, the securities issued by the 
Mortgage Securitisation Funds referred to by Law 19/1992 will have a weighting of 50% in 
relation to the solvency ratio they must maintain, provided their credit quality, in the judgment 
of the CNMV, is at least equal to that of the underlying mortgage loans. 
At the registration date of this Prospectus, the CNMV has given the Class A1 and A2 Bonds the 
weighting mentioned in the preceding paragraph, haven taken into account the following 
factors: (i) that the Mortgage Loans have been granted and secured with a first mortgage on 
homes located in Spain; (ii) that the Mortgage Loans and the PHs comply with the requirements 
of the applicable legislation regulating the mortgage market; (iii) that the principal of each of 
the Mortgage Loans is not in excess of 80% of the appraised value of the mortgaged home; 
(iv) the representations given by the Issuer and set out in section 2.2.8 of the Additional 
Building Block; and (v) the rating granted by the Rating Agencies set out in section 7.5 of the 
Securities Note, as evaluation of the financial risk of the Bonds. 
The Class B and C Bonds do not enjoy the 50% weighting in the solvency ratio of credit 
institutions and of securities dealer firms and broker firms referred to by the aforesaid Orders. 
 
 
42 


 
The Deed of Establishment shall be governed and interpreted in accordance with Spanish 
legislation. 
4.4. Indication of whether the securities are in registered or bearer form and 
whether the securities are in certificated or book-entry form. 
The Bonds issued against the Fund shall be represented by book entries in accordance with 
article 5.9 of Law 19/1992 and shall be constituted as such by virtue of their registration in the 
corresponding accounting record. The Deed of Establishment will have the effects envisaged in 
Article 6 of Law 24/1988. 
The denomination, number of units, nominal value and other characteristics and conditions 
required to identify the Bonds represented by book entries are those included in the Deed of 
Establishment and in this Securities Note. 
The Bondholders will be identified as such in the accounting register managed by the Entities 
participating in the Sociedad de Gestión de los Sistemas de Registro, Compensación y 
Liquidación de Valores, S.A., which will be the entity charged with the accounting register of the 
Bonds in the Deed of Establishment, so that the clearing and settlement of the Bonds is carried 
out in accordance with the operating rules applicable to securities quoted on the AIAF Fixed 
Income Market and represented by book entries already in force or to be approved in the future 
by the Sociedad de Gestión de los Sistemas de Registro, Compensación y Liquidación de

4.8.1 Nominal interest rate of the Bonds. 
The Bonds of each Class will accrue an annual nominal interest, variable quarterly and with 
quarterly payment, which will be the one that results from applying the rules established below. 
The resulting annual nominal interest rate (hereinafter the “Nominal Interest Rate”) shall be 
paid quarterly on each Payment Date on the Outstanding Principal Balance of the Bonds of each 
Class (the two concepts being described in sections 4.8.2 and 4.9.3.3 of the Securities Note 
respectively and following), provided that the Fund has sufficient funds in accordance with the 
Order of Priority of Payments envisaged in section 3.4.6 of the Additional Building Block and

on behalf of the Fund in the manner established by law. 
4.8.1.1 
Accrual of interest. 
The term of the issue will be divided into successive “Interest Periods” consisting of 
the actual days between each Payment Date, including in each Interest Period the initial 
Payment Date and excluding the final Payment Date, in accordance with the general 
regime and with the exceptions envisaged in section 4.8.2 of the Securities Note. 
Exceptionally, the first Interest Period will have a term different to the quarter, 
equivalent to the period between and including the Closing Date and, but excluding, the 
first Payment Date, in both cases calculated on the basis of a 360-day year. 
4.8.1.2 
Nominal Interest Rate 
The Nominal Interest Rate for each Interest Period will be the sum of (i) the Reference 
Interest Rate or, if necessary, its substitute, both described in section 4.8.1.3 below, and 
(ii) a margin for each Class. 
 
 
46 


 
• 
Class A1: margin between 0.02% and 0.10%, both inclusive. 
• 
Class A2: margin between 0.10% and 0.20%, both inclusive. 
• 
Class B: margin between 0.20% and 0.40%, both inclusive. 
• 
Class C: margin between 0.40% and 0.80%, both inclusive. 
The margin applicable to each Class, stated as a percentage, shall be established by the 
Gestora, after consulting with the Lead Manager and with the Underwriters, before 11:00 
(CET) on the first day of the Subscription Period. 
The final margins applicable to each Class shall be notified in writing by the Gestora, 
before the beginning of the Subscription Period, to the Lead Manager and to the 
Underwriters for them to inform the investors interested in subscribing to the Bonds. At 
the same time the Gestora will also notify the CNMV as additional information to the 
Prospectus. 
The final margin applicable to each Class will be registered in the Notarial certificate for 
the payment of the Bond Issue. 
If no agreement is reached with the Lead Manager and with the Underwriters, the 
Gestora will fix the following definitive margins itself: 
• 
Class A1: 0.05% 
• 
Class A2: 0.15% 
• 
Class B: 0.30% 
• 
Class C: 0.60% 
4.8.1.3 
Reference Interest Rate and its determination (Euribor). 
(i) 
For the first Interest Period the reference interest rate for calculating the interest 
rate applicable to the Bonds will be an interpolation of the 3-month Euribor rate 
“Euro InterBank Offered Rate” and the 4-month Euribor rate, and for the other 
Interest Periods, the 3-month Euribor rate, calculated and disseminated by the 
BRIDGE financial information system by order of the FBE (“Federation Bancaire 
de l'Union Europeene”), fixed at 11:00 a.m. (CET, “Central European Time”) 
 
 
47 


 
on the Interest Rate Fixing Date, and which is currently published on electronic 
page EURIBOR01, supplied by REUTERS, and on electronic page 248, supplied by 
Dow Jones Markets (Bridge Telerate), or any other page that could replace these 
for this service. 
The aforementioned interpolation will take into consideration the number of days 
elapsed between the Closing Date (as defined in section 4.13), inclusive, and the 
first Payment Date, exclusive. 
The formula for carrying out the interpolation will be as follows: 
TCa= [(TL - TC) / (DL - DC) x (DCa - DC)] + TC 
Where: 
TCa 
is the rate resulting from the interpolation, expressed as a percentage. 
TL 
is the rate for the long period (4 months), expressed as a percentage. 
TC 
is the rate for the short period (3 months), expressed as a percentage. 
DL 
is the number of days in the long period (120 days); 
DC 
is the number of days in the short period (90 days); and 
DCa is the number of days between the Closing Date, inclusive, and the first 
Payment Date, exclusive. 
At present, the Euribor rate is the rate offered for interbank deposits at term in 
Euros, calculated as the daily mean of quotations supplied by a panel of 57 of the 
more active banks in the Euro zone. The rate is quoted on the calculation base of 
actual days until maturity and a 360-day year, and it is set at 11:00 a.m. CET., 
expressed with three (3) decimal figures. 
The resulting Reference Interest Rate will be expressed as a percentage rounded 
down to the nearest one thousandth of a percentage point or rounded up to the 
nearest thousandth if the differences to the closest higher and lower thousandth 
are equal. 
(ii) 
In the event of the absence of or inability to obtain the rate established in the 
above section (i), the substitute Reference Interest Rate will be the result of 
 
 
48 


 
calculating the simple arithmetic mean of the interbank interest rates offered for 
non-transferable deposit operations, in Euros, with three (3) months maturity, or, 
for the first Interest Period, with between three (3) and four (4) months maturity,  
on the Interest Rate Fixing Date, quoted by the banks indicated below (the 
“Reference Banks”) upon prior simultaneous request to each of these by the 
Gestora through the Financial Agent after 11:00 a.m. (CET) of the Interest Rate 
Fixing Date. 
• 
Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, S.A.  
• 
Banco Santander Central Hispano, S.A.  
• 
Confederación Española de Cajas de Ahorros  
• 
Deutsche Bank AG  
In the event that it is not possible to apply the above substitute reference interest 
rate, due to the fact that one of the above mentioned Reference Banks does not 
provide a continuous quotation, the interest rate to be applied will be the interest 
rate equal to the simple arithmetic mean of the interest rates quoted by at least 
two (2) of the remaining Reference Banks. 
The substitute Reference Interest Rate will be expressed as a percentage rounded 
down to the nearest one thousandth of a percentage point or rounded up to the 
nearest thousandth if the differences between the closest higher and lower 
thousandth are equal. 
(iii) 
In the absence of or impossibility of obtaining the rates established in sections (i) 
and (ii) above, the interest rate to be applied shall be the last Reference Interest 
Rate applied to the last Interest Period and this rate will be applied for all 
successive Interest Periods while this situation continues. For the first Interest 
Period, the aforementioned interpolation will be carried out with the last 3 month 
and 4 month Euribor rates available immediately prior to 11:00 a.m. (CET) on the 
Interest Rate Fixing Date, calculated and distributed as described in paragraph (i) 
above. 
The Gestora will keep the contents lists of the Reuters EURIBOR01 and Telerate 
248 screens, or, where appropriate, of the quotations published by the Reference 
Banks, as accrediting documents for the Euribor rate applied. 
 
 
49 


 
4.8.1.4 
Interest Rate Fixing Date 
Except for the first Interest Period, the Nominal Interest Rate applicable to the Bonds of 
each of the Classes for each Interest Period will be determined by the Gestora for and on 
behalf of the Fund at 11:00 a.m. (CET) on the second business day prior to each 
Payment Date (hereinafter the “Interest Rate Fixing Date”) and will be applied for the 
following Interest Period. 
The reference interest rate for the first Interest Period will be fixed at 11:00 a.m. (CET) 
on the Date of Establishment, while the Nominal Interest Rate applicable to the Bonds of 
each of the Classes for the first Interest Period will be determined before 11:00 a.m. 
(CET) on the day of the start of the Subscription Period (once the definitive margins have 
been fixed) and shall be notified in writing by the Gestora, before the start of the 
Subscription Period, to the Lead Manager and to the Underwriters for them to inform the 
investors interested in subscribing to the Bonds. Furthermore, the Gestora shall also 
notify the CNMV of this, as supplementary information to this Prospectus, in addition to 
the Governing Body of AIAF and the Sociedad de Gestión de los Sistemas de Registro, 
Compensación y Liquidación de Valores S.A. 
The Nominal Interest Rate determined for each of the Classes of Bonds for the following 
Interest Periods will be notified to the Bondholders within the term and in the manner 
envisaged in section 4.1.1 of the Additional Building Block. 
4.8.1.5 
Formula for calculating interest 
Interest payable on each Payment Date in respect of each Interest Period will be 
calculated according to the following formula:  
I = P x R x d/360 
Where: 
I= 
Interest payable on the relevant Payment Date  
P = 
Outstanding Principal Balance of each Bond on the Determination Date

4.8.2  Dates, place, entities and procedure for the payment of interest. 
The interest on the Bonds for each Class will be paid on the 15th of March, June, September 
and December of each year, the first Payment Date being 15 March 2006, until their final 
redemption (each of these dates, in accordance with the provisions of the following paragraph, 
a “Payment Date”), via the procedure outlined in section 4.8.1.2 of this Securities Note. 
In the event that any of the dates mentioned in the previous paragraph are not a Business Day, 
the Payment Date shall be the next Business Day and interest for the Interest Period in 
progress will accrue up to but not including said next Business Day. 
For the purposes of this issue of Bonds, and throughout their life, “Business Days” will be 
considered as all those days that do not fall on: 
 
 
51 


 
• 
Saturday; 
• 
Sunday; 
• 
non-operating days according to the TARGET (“Trans European Automated 
Real-Time Gross Settlement Express Transfer System”) calendar in force at 
the time, which in 2005 are 1 January, Good Friday, Easter Monday, 1 May, 25 
December and 26 December;  
• 
A holiday in the city of Madrid. 
The first Payment Date for interest on the Bonds of all the Classes shall be 15 March 2006, with 
the corresponding Nominal Interest Rate being accrued from the Closing Date (envisaged in 
section 4.13.5 of the Securities Note), inclusive, until but not including 15 March 2006. 
Both the interest resulting in favour of Bondholders of each Class, calculated according to the 
provisions of section 4.8.1.5 above, and the amount of interest accrued but not yet paid, will be 
notified to holders in the manner described in section 4.1 of the Additional Building Block at 
least one (1) calendar day prior to each Payment Date. 
Payment of the interest accrued by the Bonds will take place on each Payment Date provided 
the Fund has sufficient liquidity for this, in accordance with the Order of Priority of Payments 
established in section 3.4.6 of the Additional Building Block, and the exceptional rules envisaged 
therein, and the Fund Liquidation Order of Priority of Payments established in section 3.4.6 of 
the Additional Building Block and the exceptional rules envisaged therein. 
In the event that on a Payment Date, the Fund does not have enough funds to make a full or a 
partial payment of interest accrued on the Bonds of any of the Classes in accordance with the 
Order of Priority of Payments established in section 3.4.6 of the Securities Note and the Fund 
Liquidation Order of Priority of Payments established in section 3.4.6 of the Additional Building 
Block, the amounts not received by Bondholders shall be paid on the following Payment Date. 
Deferred interest shall accrue interest for Bondholders equal to that applied to the Bonds of the 
respective Classes during the Interest Period(s) until the Payment Date on which the deferred 
interest is paid, without accruing default interest and without this implying capitalisation of the 
debt. 
The Fund, through the Gestora, may not defer payment of interest on the Bonds beyond the 
Final Maturity Date, or, if this is not a Business Day, the following Business Day. 
 
 
52 


 
The financial service for the Issue of the Bonds will be executed through the Financial Agent, 
with which the Gestora, for and on behalf of the Fund, will enter into a Financial Services 
Agreement. 
4.9. Date of maturity and repayment of the securities 
4.9.1  Repayment price of the Bonds, specifying the existence of premiums, 
bonuses, allotments or any other financial advantage  
The repayment price for the Bonds of all the Classes will be fifty thousand (50,000) euro per 
Bond, equivalent to 100% of the nominal value, payable progressively on each Payment Date. 
All the Bonds of the same Class shall be repaid in equal amounts via the reduction of the 
nominal value of each of these. The amount to be repaid for the redemption of the Bonds of 
each Class on each Payment Date shall be calculated as envisaged in section 4.9.2 of this 
Securities Note. 
4.9.2 Specific characteristics of the redemption of each of the Classes of Bonds 
4.9.2.1 
Redemption of Class A1 Bonds 
The redemption of Class A1 Bonds will be carried out on a pro rata basis among these 
via the reduction of the nominal value of each Bond, until this is completed, on each 
Payment Date.  
The first Payment Date for the redemption of Class A1 Bonds shall be 15 March 2006, 
in accordance with the rules contained in section 4.8.2 of the Securities Note. 
4.9.2.2 
Redemption of Class A2 Bonds 
The redemption of Class A2 Bonds will be carried out on a pro rata basis among these via 
the reduction of the nominal value of each Bond, until this is completed, on each 
Payment Date, where appropriate. 
The first Payment Date for the redemption of Class A2 Bonds will be the Payment Date 
on which all Class A1 Bonds have been redeemed.  
 
 
53 


 
4.9.2.3 
Redemption of Class B Bonds 
The redemption of Class B Bonds will be carried out on a pro rata basis among these via 
the reduction of the nominal value of each Bond, until this is completed, on each 
Payment Date, where appropriate. 
The first Payment Date for the redemption of Class B Bonds will be the Payment Date on 
which all Class A2 Bonds have been redeemed, without prejudice to the rules for the 
allocation of the Funds Available for Redemption envisaged in section 4.9.2.5 below. 
4.9.2.4 
Redemption of Class C Bonds 
The redemption of Class C Bonds will be carried out on a pro rata basis among these via 
the reduction of the nominal value of each Bond, until this is completed, on each 
Payment Date, where appropriate.
The first Payment Date for the redemption of Class C Bonds will be the Payment Date on 
which all Class B Bonds have been redeemed, without prejudice to the rules for the 
allocation of the Funds Available for Redemption envisaged in section 4.9.2.5 below. 
4.9.2.5 
Distribution of the Funds Available for Redemption among the Bonds of each 
Class 
The Bonds of Classes B and C may be partially redeemed even if Class A2 Bonds have 
not been fully redeemed, in accordance with the following rules: 
1st 
The Funds Available for Redemption of the Bonds shall be allocated entirely to the 
redemption of Class A1 Bonds until the Payment Date on which these are fully 
redeemed. 
2nd 
Once the Class A1 Bonds have been fully redeemed and until the first Payment 
Date (inclusive) on which the Outstanding Principal Balance of Classes B and C is 
equal to or higher than 6.22% of the Outstanding Principal Balance of all the 
Classes, the Funds Available for Redemption shall be fully allocated to the 
redemption of Class A2 Bonds. 
3rd 
From the Payment Date subsequent to that on which the ratio between the 
Outstanding Principal Balance of Class B and C and the Outstanding Principal 
Balance of all the Classes is equal to or higher than 6.22%, the Funds Available for 
Redemption shall be allocated to the redemption of Classes A2, B and C 
 
 
54 


 
proportionally among these, so that this ratio remains at 6.22% or the nearest 
possible higher percentage. 
However, the proportional redemption of Classes A2, B, and C shall not be carried 
out and the Funds Available for Redemption shall be allocated  sequentially to the 
redemption of the Classes in accordance with the Order of Priority of Payments if, 
on any Payment Date, any of the following circumstances were to arise: 
a) 
That on the Determination Date corresponding to the Payment Date in 
progress, the Outstanding Balance of the PHs with payments more than 
ninety (90) days past due, in relation to the total Outstanding Balance of 
PHs at the same date, was higher than 2%. 
b) 
That the Reserve Fund was smaller than the Required Amount of the 
Reserve Fund. 
When the circumstances set out in a) and b) above cease occurring, proportional 
redemption as described above shall be resumed. 
4th 
On the Payment Dates subsequent to the first Payment Date when the amount of 
the PHs pending redemption is lower than 10% of their initial amount, the pro rata 
redemption of Classes A2, B and C shall not be carried out and the Funds Available 
for Redemption shall be allocated sequentially to the redemption of the Classes in 
accordance with the Order of Priority of Payments until their full redemption. 
The amounts not received by Bondholders due to the existence of a Redemption Deficit 
will be paid on the following Payment Date on which this is possible, without accruing 
additional or default interest (as these amounts will form part of the Outstanding 
Principal Balance of the Bonds of the same Class on which the calculation of interest 
payment is carried out in the manner envisaged in section 4.8.2 of the Securities Note). 
The Gestora shall notify the Bondholders, as envisaged in section 4.1.1 of the Additional 
Building Block, of the amount of the repayment in their favour, the Outstanding Principal 
Balances of the Bonds, the Redemption Deficit, if this exists, and the real early 
redemption rates of the Mortgage Loans and their estimated residual life on the 
Determination Date prior to each Payment Date. 
 
 
55 


 
4.9.3 Common characteristics of the redemption of each of the Classes of Bonds 
4.9.3.1 
Final and Partial Redemption 
The Date of Final Maturity and definitive redemption of the Bonds of all the Classes is 15 
September 2038 or, if this were not a Business Day, the following Business Day, although 
the Gestora, acting for and on behalf of the Fund, as provided for in section 4.9.3.6 of 
the Securities Note below, may redeem the issue early, in which case the Payment Date 
on which this occurs will be the date of definitive redemption of the Bonds. 
Notwithstanding the above, the Fund, through the Gestora, will partially redeem the 
Bonds of all Classes as described below. 
4.9.3.2 
Determination Dates and Periods 
The “Determination Dates” are the dates on which the Gestora, for and on behalf of 
the Fund, will make the calculations required to allocate or withhold the Funds Available 
on these dates, in accordance with the Order of Priority of Payments established in 
section 3.4.6 of the Additional Building Block, and the Fund Liquidation Order of Priority 
of Payments established in section 3.4.6 of the Additional Building Block. 
Exceptionally: 
(i) 
the first Determination Period will run from the Date of Establishment (inclusive) to 
the first Determination Date (exclusive); and 
(ii) 
the duration of the final Determination Period will be equivalent to the days 
elapsed a) until the Final Maturity Date or the date on which the Early Liquidation 
of the Fund is concluded, in accordance with the provisions of section 4.4.3 of the 
Registration Document, on which the Mortgage Loans and the assets remaining in 
the Fund have been liquidated and all the Funds Available for Liquidation allocated 
in accordance with the Fund Liquidation Order of Priority of Payments of the Fund, 
b) from the Determination Date prior to the Payment Date preceding the date 
mentioned in a), both dates to be included. 
The Determination Dates will be the dates corresponding to the fifth (5th) Business Day 
prior to each Payment Date, and the periods falling between two successive 
Determination Dates will be known as “Determination Periods” including in each 
period the first Determination Date and excluding the final Determination Date. 
 
 
56 


 
4.9.3.3 
Outstanding Principal Balance of the Bonds. 
The “Outstanding Principal Balances of the Bonds” are the outstanding balances of 
the principal of the Bonds pending redemption, including principal accrued on previous 
Payment Dates and not paid due to a lack of Available Funds, as described in section 
4.9.3.5 below, and in accordance with the Order of Priority of Payments established in 
section 3.4.6 of the Additional Building Block, and the Fund Liquidation Order of Priority 
of Payments established in section 3.4.6. 
4.9.3.4 
Amount of Principal Accrued for Redemption on each Payment Date 
The “Amount of Principal Accrued for Redemption” of the Bonds of all the classes, 
without distinction among these, shall be equal to the difference between the  sum of the 
Outstanding Principal Balances of the Bonds and the Outstanding Balance of the PHs, as 
described in the following paragraph, on the Determination Date prior to each Payment 
Date, provided this difference is positive. 
The “Outstanding Balance of the PHs” will comprise for these purposes the sum of (i) 
the principal pending maturity and (ii) the principal matured and not paid into the Fund 
of each of the PHs, having deducted in the latter case the principal matured and pending 
maturity corresponding to Mortgage Loans which have accumulated a delay equal to or 
longer than a period of 18 months in the payment of any amounts owed for principal or 
interest.  
4.9.3.5 
Amount payable in respect of redemption on each Payment Date and 
Redemption Deficit 
The amount allocated to the redemption of the Bonds (the “Funds Available for 
Redemption”) on each Payment Date shall be the smaller of the following amounts: 
(i) 
the Amount of Principal Accrued for Redemption; or 
(ii) 
Depending on existing liquidity, the Funds Available which may be allocated to 
satisfying the payment obligations indicated in 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th place in the 
Order of Priority of Payments established in section 3.4.6 of the Additional Building 
Block, in view of the exceptional rules envisaged therein and the rules for the 
“Distribution of the Funds Available for Redemption among the Bonds of 
each Class” established in section 4.9.2.5 of the Securities Note or to satisfying 
the payment obligations indicated in 5th, 6th, 8th, and 10th place  in the Fund 
 
 
57 


 
Liquidation Order of Priority of Payments described in section 3.4.6 of the 
Additional Building Block. 
The “Redemption Deficit” shall be the positive difference, if this exists, between the 
Accrued Amount of Principal for Redemption and the Funds Available for Redemption.  
4.9.3.6 
Early Redemption 
Without prejudice to the Fund’s obligation, through the Gestora, to redeem the Bonds on 
the Final Maturity Date or partially on each Payment Date, the Gestora, with prior 
notification to the CNMV, is authorised to carry out the early liquidation of the Fund, on a 
Payment Date, if less than 10% of the initial balance of the PH portfolio is pending 
payment, in accordance with article 5.3 of Law 19/1992. This authorisation is dependent 
on the early redemption of the PHs, together with the balance existing at that moment in 
the Treasury Account and, where appropriate, in the Cash Surplus Account, allowing the 
total cancellation of all obligations pending with Bondholders (in the manner envisaged in 
section 4.4.3 of the Registration Document), subject to making the payments prior to 
these whose order of priority is preferential according to the provisions of section 3.4.6 
of the Additional Building Block and the exception rules established in that section. 
Article 5.6 of Law 19/1992 requires that flows of principal and interest corresponding to 
the Bonds issued against the Fund coincide with the flows of all the PHs included therein, 
without other time lags than those deriving from administration and management fees 
and expenses, underwriting premiums and other applicable items. If as a result of an 
exceptional event or circumstance unforeseen on the date of granting of the Deed of 
Establishment, there is a permanent distortion of the financial balance of the Fund 
required by Law 19/1992 for reasons unrelated to the normal operating conditions of the 
Fund, such as regulatory or statutory changes, withholdings or other situations that in a 
permanent manner could affect the financial equilibrium of the Fund, the Gestora, for 
and on behalf of the Fund, may carry out the early redemption of the Bond issue. The 
possible existence of a Redemption Deficit does not in itself represent a cause of the 
Fund’s financial imbalance to the extent that this forms part of its normal operating 
conditions. 
The Gestora, for and on behalf of the Fund, may also carry out the early redemption of 
the Fund when the PHs are fully redeemed, when a default indicative of a serious and 
permanent imbalance occurs in relation with some of the Bonds or this is expected to 
occur, or when the Bonds are fully redeemed (no later than the Final Maturity Date).  
 
 
58 


 
Moreover, the early redemption of the Fund and redemption of the Bonds shall occur in 
the event that the Gestora is declared subject to insolvency proceedings or its 
authorisation is revoked and no new Gestora is appointed within a period of four months, 
in accordance with section 4.4.3 of the Registration Document. 
Early redemption as a result of the circumstances outlined above shall occur under the 
terms and conditions established in section 4.4.3 of the Registration Document. 
4.10. Indication of the yield 
The main characteristic of the Bonds lies in their periodic redemption, so their average life and 
duration depends mainly on the speed with which the mortgage obligors decide to repay their 
Mortgage Loans. 
The prepayments which the obligors may decide to make, subject to continual changes and 
estimated in this Prospectus by means of the Constant Prepayment Rate (hereinafter “CPR”), 
will impact directly on the rate of repayment of the Mortgage Loans and therefore on the 
average life and duration of the Bonds. 
Other factors exist, also subject to continual change, which affect the average life and duration 
of the Bonds. These variables and their hypothetical values assumed in all the tables in this 
section are: 
• 
the interest rate of the PH portfolio: 2.733% (weighted average nominal interest 
rate at 25 October 2005); 
• 
percentage non-performance of the PH portfolio: 0% annual, 0% monthly; 
• 
percentage defaults of the PH portfolio: 0%; 
• 
that the rate of early redemption remains constant over the life of the Bonds; 
• 
that the Closing Date for the Bonds is 28 November 2005; 
• 
that there is no Redemption Deficit; and 
• 
that the Gestora shall redeem all the bonds when the Outstanding Balance of the 
PHs is below 10% of their initial amount. 
The real adjusted duration of the Bonds will also depend on their variable interest rate, and in 
all the tables included in this section this is assumed to remain constant at 2.400% for Class 
 
 
59 


 
A1, 2.500% for Class A2, 2.650% for Class B, and 2.950% for Class C, except for the first 
Interest Period, in which the rates are 2.429% for Class A1, 2.529% for Class A2, 2.679% for 
Class B, and 2.979% for Class C. The real adjusted duration of the Bonds has been done using 
the 3-month Euribor benchmark fixed at 15 November 2005 (2.350%), except for the first 
Interest Period, for which the reference interest rate obtained by interpolation between the 3-
month and the 4-month Euribor rates fixed at 15 November 2005 is 2.379%, while the margins 
for each Class are 0.05% (Series A1), 0.15% (Class A2), 0.30% (Class B) and 0.60% (Class C). 
4.10.1 Estimated average life, yield or return, term and final redemption of the 
Bonds 
Assuming that the Fund exercises the option of early redemption, i.e. when the amount of the 
PHs pending redemption is less than 10% of their initial amount, the average life and term of 
the Bonds for the different CPR scenarios shown in the table below would be the following:

Underwriting Agreement is cancelled due to the citing of one of the conditions of termination 
envisaged therein before 10:00 a.m. on the Closing Date (see section 4.1 of the Securities 
Note), the Gestora shall establish the definitive margins itself and inform the CNMV that 
Barclays Bank, S.A. will finally act as Underwriter by virtue of its underwriting commitment 
referred to in section 4.1 of the Securities Note and reflected in the underwriting agreement 
subject to the aforesaid conditions of termination. 
4.13.4 Placement and allocation of the Bonds. 
The placement procedure shall be as follows: 
Barclays Bank PLC, acting through its investment banking division Barclays Capital (or Barclays 
Bank, S.A., as applicable), shall accept or reject, acting freely, the orders received, while 
ensuring that no discriminatory treatment is given to orders of similar characteristics. However, 
Barclays Bank PLC, acting through its investment banking division Barclays Capital (or Barclays 
Bank, S.A., as applicable), may give priority to orders from those clients it deems most 
appropriate and may also acquire part or all of the Bonds for itself. No bonds are expected to 
be initially subscribed for by Barclays Bank, S.A. 
 
 
68 


 
The Underwriters undertake to subscribe in their own name, at the end of the Subscription 
Period, the amount of Bonds necessary to complete their underwriting commitment as stated in 
section 4.1 of this Securities Note. This commitment is subject to the agreement with the 
Gestora and the Lead Manager regarding the margins to be used to calculate the Nominal 
Interest Rate of each Class of Bonds and the non-invoking by the Underwriters of any of the 
conditions for termination envisaged in the Underwriting Agreement (see section 4.1 of the 
Securities Note). 
4.13.5 How and when to make payment 
Investors to whom the Bonds have been allotted must pay Barclays Bank PLC, acting through 
its investment banking division Barclays Capital (or Barclays Bank, S.A., as applicable), on the 
Closing Date, before 10:00 a.m., Madrid time, for value that same day, the issue price (100% 
of the nominal value) of each Bond allotted. 
After having informed Barclays Bank, S.A. by fax (+34 91 336 14 29), each Underwriter will pay 
the respective amount underwritten, after deducting the underwriting fee accrued in favour of 
each, into the account open at the Bank of Spain in the name of Barclays Bank. S.A. (nº 01 01 
40 06 50 and BARCESMM code). 
4.14. Restrictions on the free transferability of the securities. 
The Bonds of this issue are not subject to restrictions regarding their free transferability, which 
shall be carried out in accordance with applicable legislation and the provisions of sections 4.4, 
5.1 and 5.2.1 of the Securities Note. 
The registration on the accounting records of the transfer to the purchaser will have the same 
effect as the delivery of the securities and from that moment the transfer will be enforceable 
against third parties. 
5. 
ADMISSION TO TRADING AND DEALING ARRANGEMENTS 
5.1. Market on which the securities will be traded 
In compliance with the provisions of article 5.9 of Law 19/1992, the Gestora will apply to have 
the Bonds admitted to trading in the AIAF immediately after the grant of the Deed of 
Establishment and once the Bonds have been paid for. It is expected that final admission to 
trading will be obtained no later than thirty (30) days after the Closing Date. 
 
 
69 


 
The Gestora hereby declares that it is aware of the requirements and conditions necessary for 
the listing, continued listing and delisting of securities on the AIAF, according to the applicable 
legislation and the requirements of its governing bodies, and the Fund, through the Gestora, 
agrees to comply therewith. 
If the above time period elapses without the Bonds having been admitted to trading in the 
AIAF, the Gestora, pursuant to section 4.1.2 of the Additional Building Block, will give 
immediate notice of this to the Bondholders using the Extraordinary Notification procedure 
provided in the Additional Building Block, indicating the reasons for the failure to obtain the 
listing, all without prejudice to the contractual liability that may rest with the Gestora as a result 
of that failure. 
5.2. Paying agent and depository entities 
5.2.1 Paying Agent for the Bond Issue  
The Gestora, on behalf of and for the account of the Fund, will enter into a financial services 
agreement (“Financial Services Agreement”) with Barclays Bank, S.A. to perform the 
financial servicing of the Bonds issued by the Fund. 
The obligations contained in the Financial Services Agreement as regards the paying agency are 
summarised below: 
(i) 
to pay to the Fund, in the Treasury Account, on the Closing Date, the amounts received 
from the Underwriters, minus the arrangement fee, prior to 12:00 noon Madrid time, for 
value that same day;  
(ii) 
communicate to the Gestora the information on the distribution achieved in the 
placement of the Bonds; 
(iii) 
on each Bond Payment Date, pay the interest and repay the principal of the Bonds, after 
deducting the total amount of the withholding that must be made on account of 
investment income according to the applicable tax rules, and pay the rest of the sums 
payable by the Fund according to the Prospectus; and 
(iv) 
on each of the Rate Fixing Dates, notify the Gestora of the Euribor reference interest rate 
that will serve as the benchmark for calculating the nominal interest rate applicable to 
each Bond Class. 
 
 
70 


 
As consideration for the services to be performed under the Financial Services Agreement, the 
Financial Agent will be entitled to receive from the Fund on each Payment Date for the period 
then ended a fee of 0.002% per annum of the Outstanding Principal Balance of the Bonds as at 
the previous Payment Date. 
If during the life of the Fund the non-subordinated and unsecured short-term debt of Barclays 
Bank PLC is given a credit rating below A-1, P-1 or F1 (its current ratings being A-1+, P-1 and 
F1+) on the S&P, Moody’s and Fitch rating scales for short-term risks, respectively, or if 
Barclays Bank PLC’s interest in the share capital of the Financial Agent is at any time less than 
51%, Barclays Bank S.A. will be substituted as Financial Agent by another credit institution 
whose short-term debt has minimum ratings of P-1 on the Moody’s rating scale for short-term 
risks, of A-1 on the S&P rating scale for short-term risks and of F1 on the Fitch rating scale for 
short-term risks (in which event, the Gestora will transfer to the substitute the Treasury 
Account and contract the highest possible return for the balances of the account), unless the 
Financial Agent, within thirty (30) Business Days after the assignment of the lower credit rating 
or decline in Barclays Bank PLC’s equity stake in the Financial Agent to below the said 
percentage, either  
(i) 
obtains from a credit institution whose short-term debt has the said minimum ratings a 
first demand guarantee securing for the Fund, at the simple request of the Gestora, the 
amounts deposited in the Treasury Account; or  
(ii) 
transfers the Treasury Account of the Fund to an entity whose non-subordinated and 
unsecured short-term debt must have minimum ratings of A-1, P-1 and F1 (on the S&P, 
Moody’s and Fitch rating scales for short-term risks, respectively), contracting the highest 
possible return for the balances of the Treasury Account, or 
(iii) 
if options (i) and (ii) above are not possible, the Gestora obtains from the Financial Agent 
or a third party a pledge guarantee for the benefit of the Fund over financial assets with 
credit quality not below that of the Public Debt securities of the Spanish Government, in 
a sufficient amount to secure the undertakings established in the Financial Services 
Agreement. 
In event (ii) above, the Gestora will again transfer the balances of the Treasury Account to the 
Financial Agent, provided that the non-subordinated and unsecured short-term debt of Barclays 
Bank PLC has the said A-1, P-1 and F1 ratings and Barclays Bank PLC holds an equity stake in 
the Financial Agent of 51% or more. 
 
 
71 


 
In no event may the substitution of the Financial Agent have a negative effect on the Bonds’ 
ratings. Similarly, if the credit rating of non-subordinated and unsecured short-term debt of 
Barclays Bank PLC is downgraded to A-1 (according to the S&P rating scale for short-term 
risks), and the balance of the Treasury Account is more than 20% of the Outstanding Principal 
Balance of the Bonds on a given Payment Date, the Gestora will transfer and pay the surplus 
over the said 20% into the Cash Surplus Account (“Cash Surplus Account”) opened by the 
Gestora in another credit institution whose short-term debt has a minimum rating of A-1+, P-1 
and F1 according to the said S&P, Moody’s and Fitch scales for short-term risk, respectively, 
and contract the highest possible return for that balance. 
Furthermore, if the non-subordinated and unsecured short-term debt of Barclays Bank PLC 
recovers the A-1+ rating (according to the S&P rating scale for short-term risks), the Gestora 
will once again transfer to the Treasury Account held in the Financial Agent the balance of the 
Cash Surplus Account. 
If Barclays Bank, S.A. is substituted in the performance of the function of Financial Agent, if 
possible and appropriate to the accompanying circumstances which could impede or hinder the 
proper performance of that function, the Gestora will have authority to modify the percentage 
of the fee payable to the substitute up to a maximum of 0.10% per annum of the Outstanding 
Principal Balance of the Bonds as at the preceding Payment Date, provided the substitute does 
not belong to the Barclays Group. The expenses and taxes incurred as a result of the 
substitution of the financial agent will be for the account of the outgoing financial agent.

There follows a description of the meaning S&P attributes to the long and short-term ratings 
used in this Prospectus: 
 
 
77 


 
S&P Long Term 
AAA 
An obligor rated “AAA” has an extraordinarily strong capacity to meet its financial 
obligations. “AAA” is highest rating assigned by Standard & Poor's.  
AA 
An obligor rated “AA” has a very strong capacity to meet its financial obligations. An 
obligor rated “AA” differs from the highest-rated ones only to a small degree. 
A 
An obligor rated “A” has a strong capacity to meet its financial obligations, but is 
somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in economic circumstance 
conditions than obligors in higher-rated categories.  
BBB 
An obligor rated “BBB” has adequate capacity to meet its financial obligations. 
However, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a 
weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial obligations. 
BB 
An obligor rated “'BB” is less vulnerable in the short term than other obligors of lower 
categories. However, it faces a high degree of uncertainty and exposure to adverse business, 
financial, or economic conditions which could lead to the obligor's inadequate capacity to meet 
its financial obligations.  
The ratings between “AA” and “CCC” may be modified by adding a (+) or (-) to show their 
relative position within each of the main categories. 
S&P Short Term 
A-1 
An obligor rated “A-1” has a strong capacity to meet its financial obligations. It is rated 
in the highest category by S&P. Within this category, certain obligors are designated with a plus 
sign (+). This indicates that the obligor's capacity to meet its financial obligations is extremely 
strong. 
Similarly, there follows a description of the meaning Moody’s attributes to the long and short-
term ratings used in this Prospectus: 
Moody’s Long Term 
Aaa 
Bonds which are rated “Aaa” are judged to be of the best quality. They carry the 
smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as “gilt edged.” Interest 
payments are protected by a large or by an exceptionally stable margin and principal is secure. 
 
 
78 


 
Aa 
Bonds which are rated “Aa” are judged to be of high quality by all standards. Together 
with the “Aaa” group they comprise what are generally known as high-grade bonds. They are 
rated lower than the best Bonds because margins of protection may not be as large as in “Aaa” 
securities or fluctuation of protective elements may be of greater amplitude or there may be 
other elements present which make the long-term risk appear somewhat larger than the “Aaa” 
securities. 
A 
Bonds which are rated “A” possess many favourable investment attributes and are to 
be considered as upper-medium-grade obligations. Factors giving security to principal and 
interest are considered adequate, but elements may be present which suggest a susceptibility 
to impairment some time in the future. 
Baa 
Bonds which are rated “Baa” are considered as medium-grade obligations. Interest 
payments and principal security appear adequate for the present but certain protective 
elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great length of time. 
Such bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in fact have speculative 
characteristics as well. 
Ba 
Bonds which are rated “Ba” are judged to have speculative elements; their future 
cannot be considered as well-assured. Often the protection of interest and principal payments 
may be very moderate, and thereby not well safeguarded during both good and bad times over 
the future. Uncertainty of position characterizes bonds in this class. 
Moody's applies numerical modifiers 1, 2, and 3 in long-term rating classification from “Aa” to 
“Caa”, both inclusive. The modifier 1 indicates securities ranking in the higher end of the rating 
category; the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the modifier 3 indicates a ranking 
in the lower end of that rating category.  
Moody’s Short Term 
P-1 
Excellent capacity to repay short-term debt obligations. 
P-2 
Strong capacity to repay short-term debt obligations. 
Similarly, there follows a description of the meaning Fitch attributes to the long and short-term 
ratings used in this Prospectus: 
 
 
79 


 
Fitch Long Term 
AAA 
The “AAA” rating granted by Fitch indicates the highest credit quality. It is assigned 
only in case of exceptionally strong capacity for timely payment of principal and interest on 
financial commitments. This capacity is highly unlikely to be adversely affected by foreseeable 
events. 
AA 
The “AA” rating granted by Fitch indicates very high credit quality. The capacity for 
timely payment of principal and interest is very strong. This capacity is not significantly 
vulnerable to foreseeable events. 
A 
The “A” rating granted by Fitch indicates high credit quality. The capacity for timely 
payment of principal and interest is considered strong. This capacity may, nevertheless, be 
more vulnerable to changes in circumstances or in economic conditions than is the case for 
higher ratings. 
BBB 
The “BBB” rating granted by Fitch indicates good credit quality. The capacity for timely 
payment of principal and interest is considered adequate, but adverse changes in circumstances 
and in economic conditions are more likely to impair this capacity. This is the lowest 
investment-grade category. 
BB 
The “BB” rating granted by Fitch indicates that there is a possibility of credit risk 
developing, particularly as the result of adverse economic change over time; however, business 
or financial alternatives may be available to allow financial commitments to be met. Securities 
rated in this category are not investment grade. 
Fitch Short Term 
F1 
The “F1” rating granted by Fitch indicates the highest credit quality. It indicates the 
strongest capacity for timely payment of principal and interest. It may have an added “+” to 
denote any exceptionally strong credit feature.  
The modifiers “+” or “-” may be appended to the long-term and short-term ratings to denote 
relative status within major rating categories. Nevertheless, those signs are not added to the 
“AAA” long-term rating category, to categories below “CCC”, or to short-term ratings other 
than “F1”. 
The ratings assigned to each of the Bond Class by S&P measure the Fund’s capacity for timely 
payment of interest on each scheduled Payment Date and for repayment of the principal during 
the life of the operation and, in all events, prior to the Final Maturity Date. 
 
 
80 


 
The ratings assigned to each of the Bond Class by Moody’s, in turn, measure the expected loss 
prior to the Final Maturity Date. In the opinion of Moody’s, the structure allows the timely 
payment of interest and payment of the principal during the life of the operation and, in all 
events, prior to the Final Maturity Date. 
Lastly, the ratings assigned to each of the Bond Class by Fitch measure the Fund’s capacity for 
timely payment of interest on each scheduled Payment Date and for repayment of the principal 
during the life of the operation and, in all events, prior to the Final Maturity Date, in accordance 
with the conditions stipulated for each Class in this Prospectus and in the rest of the 
supplementary documentation, which envisage deferral of the payment of interest on Class B 
and C Bonds in certain circumstances provided for in section 3.4.6 of the Additional Building 
Block, without prejudice to the exceptional rules set out in 3.4.6 of the Additional Building 
Block. This could imply that, for so long as the circumstances determining deferral of their 
payment continue to exist, the interest on the Class B and C Bonds may go unpaid on a given 
Payment Date if the Fund does not have sufficient funds, and be paid on the next Payment 
Date on which the Fund does have sufficient funds (section 4.8.2 of the Securities Note).  
The rating takes into account the structure of the Bond issue, its legal aspects and those of the 
Fund that issues them, the characteristics of the Mortgage Loans and the regularity and 
continuity of cash flows of the operation. 
The rating does not evaluate the probability of the mortgage obligors prepaying the principal, 
nor of the extent to which such prepayments may differ from those originally projected. The 
rating is in no way an indication of the rating of the actuarial level of income. 
The assigned ratings and any review or suspension thereof: 
(i) 
are issued by the Rating Agencies on the basis of a variety of information they receive, 
the accuracy and completeness of which is not warranted by the Rating Agencies, so that 
the Rating Agencies may in no way be considered responsible for that information; and 
(ii) 
do not constitute and cannot be interpreted in any way as an invitation, recommendation 
or instigation to investors to carry out any type of transaction involving the Bonds or, in 
particular, to purchase, hold, encumber or sell those Bonds. 
The final ratings assigned may be reviewed, suspended or withdrawn at any time by the Rating 
Agencies on the basis of any information they receive. Such situations, which will not be 
considered events of early redemption of the Fund, will be immediately notified to both the 
 
 
81 


 
CNMV and to the Bondholders, as provided in section 4.1 of the Securities Additional Building 
Block. 
To carry out the rating and monitoring process, the Rating Agencies rely on the accuracy and 
completeness of the information provided to them by the Gestora, auditors, lawyers and other 
experts. 
The Gestora, on behalf of and for the account of the Fund, undertakes to provide the Rating 
Agencies with periodic information on the situation of the Fund and behaviour of the assets. It 
will likewise provide that information when reasonably requested to do so and, in all events, 
whenever there is a change in the conditions of the Fund, in the contracts to which it is party 
directly and through the Gestora or in the interested parties.  
The Gestora will make its best efforts to maintain the rating of the Bonds at the initial level and, 
if the rating is downgraded, to recover the initial level.

1. 
SECURITIES 
1.1. Minimum denomination of the issue 
The Fund will be established with the Participaciones Hipotecarias (mortgage participations; 
hereinafter, “PHs”) issued by Barclays Bank, S.A. and subscribed by the Fund, whose 
aggregate principal will amount to at least 1,400,000,000 euros, the same as the nominal value 
of the Bond Issue.  
1.2. Confirmation that the information relating to an undertaking or obligor not 
involved in the issue has been accurately reproduced 
Not applicable. 
2. 
UNDERLYING ASSETS 
2.1. Confirmation of the capacity of the securitised assets to produce the funds 
payable on the securities 
In accordance with the information supplied by Barclays Bank, S.A., verified by the Lead 
Managers and the Rating Agencies, according to the their contractual terms and assuming full 
payment on their respective due dates, the securitised assets will allow the payments on the 
issued Bonds to be made as they fall due.  
Nevertheless, to cover possible payment defaults by the obligors on the securitised assets, a 
series of credit enhancement operations are planned that will cover to varying extents the 
amounts payable on the Bonds of each Class and seek to mitigate all or part of the risk inherent 
in the securitised portfolio. Nevertheless, in exceptional circumstances the credit enhancements 
could prove insufficient. The credit enhancements are described in section 3.4.2, 3.4.3 and 
3.4.4 of this Additional Building Block. 
Not all of the Bonds issued have the same risk of default, as is shown by the credit ratings 
assigned by the Rating Agencies to the Bonds of each Class and described in section 7.5 of the 
Securities Note.

the Fund as a result of an event or circumstance unrelated to the operations and development 
of the Fund, or (ii) a payment default indicative of a serious and permanent imbalance in 
relation to any of the Bonds issued or it is foreseeable that such non-payment will occur, the 
Gestora will proceed to carry out the Early Liquidation of the Fund and hence the Early 
Redemption of the Bond Issue on the terms provided in section 4.4.3 of the Registration 
Document. 
2.2. Assets backing the issue 
The credit rights to be pooled in the Fund at the time of its formation will be the credit rights 
held by Barclays Bank, S.A. in relation to the Mortgage Loans made to natural persons with 
domicile in Spain. 
The mortgage loans to be securitised (the “Mortgage Loans”) will be transferred to the Fund 
by means of the issue of mortgage participations (participaciones hipotecarias; hereinafter 
referred to as “PHs”). 
The Mortgage Loans may be considered as assets with a 50% weighting for the purposes of the 
Ministerial Order of 30 December 1993 on capital adequacy standards for credit institutions. 
Barclays Bank, S.A. will proceed to issue the PHs in accordance with the terms of Law 2/1981 
of 25 March 1981, Royal Decree 685/1982 of 17 March 1982 and Royal Decree 1289/1991 of 2 
August 1991, which amended certain articles of the previous one, so that the Gestora can pool 
them in the Fund in accordance with Law 19/1992 and other applicable provisions. Given the 
nature of the Fund, the issue of the PHs will not be the subject of a margin note in each 
registration of the mortgages in the Land Registry. 
The total nominal value of the issue of PHs will be at least equal to the total nominal amount of 
the Bond issue. Each PH represents 100% of the principal and of the interest to be repaid and 
accrued, respectively, as well as the default interest on each of the related Mortgage Loans. 
The Mortgage Loans are part of a selection of mortgage loans whose main characteristics are 
indicated in section 2.2.2 of the Additional Building Block. At 25 October 2005 the outstanding 
balance of the selected Mortgage Loans amounted to 1,470,701,593.74 euros. This amount will 
be adjusted on the Date of Establishment to bring it as close as possible to the amount of the 
Bond issue, that is, to 1,400,000,000 euros.

Audit of the assets securitised through the Fund 
The selected Mortgage Loans have been audited by the firm PricewaterhouseCoopers 
Auditores, S.L., holder of taxpayer identification number (NIF) B-79031290 and having its 
corporate domicile in Madrid, at Paseo de la Castellana, 43, registered in the ROAC Register 
(Registro Oficial de Auditores de Cuentas with number S-0242. 
The audit was performed using sampling techniques through the analysis of a number of 
transactions (sample) lower than the total selection of transactions (population) making it 
possible to draw a conclusion on that population.  
The audit examined a series of attributes of the portfolio of Mortgage Loans, both quantitative 
and qualitative, and, specifically, regarding the purpose of the Mortgage Loan, identification of 
the Borrower, date contracted, maturity date, interest rate or reference index, interest rate 
margin, interest rate applied, initial amount of the loan, current balance of the loan, payments 
past due, appraisal value, ratio of the current balance of the loan to the appraisal value, 
identification of the mortgage property, mortgage guarantee, insurance against damage. 
Selected loans in which errors are detected in the examination of the sample will not be 
assigned to the Fund by Barclays Bank, S.A. 
2.2.1 Legal jurisdiction by which the pool of assets is governed 
The securitised assets are governed by Spanish law.

outstanding principal, thereby halting the accrual of interest on the part prepaid as from the 
date of the prepayment. 
The final maturity date of the mortgage loan of the longest of the selected loans will be 30 June 
2035.

Loans to be assigned to the Fund at its establishment comprises 9,856 Mortgage Loans, whose 
aggregate outstanding principal at 25 October 2005 amounted to 1,470,701,593.74 euros. Only 
Mortgage Loans with no amounts more than thirty (30) days past due will be securitised. 
2.2.6 Ratio of outstanding balance of the principal to the appraisal value or level of 
overcollateralisation 
 
The ratio of the outstanding principal to the appraised value or level of overcollateralisation is 
as shown in the distribution by loan-to-value (LTV) chart set out in section 2.2.2. j). 
 
2.2.7 Method of creation of the assets 
The Mortgage Loans selected for assignment to the Fund have been made by Barclays Bank, 
S.A. according to the ordinary procedures followed for analysing and assessing credit risk in its 
mortgage lending business. There follows a description of the procedures currently followed by 
Barclays Bank, S.A.: 
Organisational channels  
The Mortgage Loans are marketed through the distribution channel of Barclays Bank, S.A. 
This model is based on personalised comprehensive customer management; all clients are 
assigned a personal manager.  
Lending process 
The acceptance process starts with the application for the credit/loan by the office (manager). 
The acceptance of the transactions starts with an application by the client, who may be known 
as an already existing client, or a past client, or one who may never had had any prior dealings 
with Barclays Bank, S.A. 
Required information 
 
 
91 


 
The manager, after sending the application for analysis and subsequent approval of the 
operation, generally asks the clients for the following documents: 
(i)  
documents demonstrating the intended purpose of the loan (agreement for down 
payment, pledge, sale-purchase, budgets for home alterations, etc.); and 
(ii)  
documents evidencing the applicant’s income and credit quality. 
Depending on the source of income (work, own business, employment for others or other 
situations), they will be asked to provide:  
(i)  
Paycheques, personal income tax statement, most recent quarterly VAT declarations.  
(ii)  
If the employment relation is less than two years old, a copy of the employment 
agreement and/or official certificate of employment history will need to be provided. 
Preparation of the proposal and approval  
The office, if it considers the credit/loan requested by the customer to be viable, will draw up 
the mandatory proposal and submit it to the approval process by the Risks Department. 
The decision is made by the Risks Department, which after checking the documents will 
approve the operation, with approval conditional, where appropriate, on the appraisal and 
formal granting of the mortgage. 
Delegation in authorising risks 
The delegation is regulated by internal rules and is supervised on a centralised basis. The most 
important aspects that influence the management model include: 
(i)  
The delegation is conferred on a personal basis and based on the experience of the 
delegate.  
(ii)  
The delegation figure represents the maximum limits and risks which may be reached 
with a client or group of clients considered an economic group or family unit.  
(iii)  The delegation originates in the policy-making bodies of the group.

2.2.9 Substitution of the securitised assets 
In the event of early redemption of the PHs through the prepayment of the principal of the 
Mortgage Loans, there will be no substitution of the affected PHs. 
In the event that during the life of the PHs it is detected that a PH does not conform at the 
date of the Deed of Establishment to the conditions and characteristics contained in section 
2.2.8 of the Additional Building Block because the related Mortgage Loan does not do so, 
Barclays Bank, S.A. undertakes, upon prior agreement of the Gestora, to immediately substitute 
the relevant PH, subject to the following rules: 
1. 
The substitution by Barclays Bank, S.A. will in all events be made for the nominal value 
(outstanding principal not yet due and principal past due but not paid to the Fund on 
each of the PHs) plus the interest accrued but not yet paid. The substitution will be 
carried out by issuing PHs over loans in its portfolio eligible to be pooled in an asset 
securitisation fund of characteristics comparable to the Mortgage Loan underlying the PH 
to be replaced in terms of amount, term (equal to or less than the maximum time limit 
for maturity of the Mortgage Loans), interest rate, characteristics of the obligor and 
characteristics of the mortgaged property, as well as the credit quality in terms of the 
ratio of the outstanding balance of the PH to the appraised value of the property serving 
as collateral for the underlying loan. 
If 15 calendar days after the notice, there are no loans in the Barclays Bank, S.A. 
portfolio with characteristics consistent with the Mortgage Loan underlying the PH to be 
replaced, Barclays Bank, S.A. undertakes to carry out the early redemption of the 
affected PHs, making an immediate cash payment of the outstanding principal, the 
interest accrued and not yet paid and any other sum to which the Fund is entitled as that 
date by virtue of the PH. 
2. 
The substitution will be carried out according to the following procedure: 
2.1 
Barclays Bank, S.A. will notify the Gestora of the existence of the affected or 
ineligible PH, and the Gestora will give its consent prior to the replacement. 
Barclays Bank, S.A. will thereupon immediately cancel the said PH and issue 
another PH with similar characteristics of term to maturity, interest rate, value of 
 
 
97 


 
the outstanding principal and credit quality in terms of the ratio of the outstanding 
balance of the PH to the appraised value of the property serving as collateral for 
the underlying Mortgage Loan, provided that prior to the substitution the suitability 
of the replacement loans has been checked by an outside audit firm, as provided 
in the introductory paragraph of section 2.2 of the Additional Building Block, so 
that the financial structure of the Fund is not affected by the substitution. 
2.2 
The issue of the PH by Barclays Bank, S.A. as issuer and the replacement by the 
Gestora, on behalf of and for the account of the Fund, will be carried out by means 
of the execution of a notary certificate setting out the particulars of both the PH 
that must be replaced and of its underlying Mortgage Loan and of the new PH 
issued, with the data on the Mortgage Loan, as well as the reason for the 
substitution and the characteristics which determine the consistency between both 
PHs, as described above. The certificate must be issued within 30 calendar days 
following the notice referred to in section 2.1 above. A copy of the certificate will 
be delivered to the CNMV, to the securities registration, clearing and settlement 
service Sociedad de Gestión de los Sistemas de Registro, Compensación y 
Liquidación de Valores, S.A. and to the AIAF and will be notified to the Rating 
Agencies. In addition, the Gestora will deliver the multiple certificate representing 
the PHs to Barclays Bank, S.A. and the latter will issue a new multiple certificate 
including all of the PHs owned by the Fund (excluding the replaced PH and 
including the replacement PH). 
2.2.10 Relevant insurance policies relating to the securitised assets 
In accordance with representation (16) made by the Seller and set out in section 2.2.8 
above, the public deeds in which the Mortgage Loans are formally contracted provide 
that until they have been repaid in full, the borrower is obliged to keep the mortgaged 
properties insured against the risk of fire and other damage for the life of the contract, at 
least on the minimum conditions required by the applicable legislation governing the 
mortgage market, with assignment to Barclays Bank, S.A. of the indemnities received in 
respect of insured sums or payable for any other reason by the insurer. 
The said representation also establishes that Barclays Bank, S.A. has contracted a 
subsidiary global policy with CASER, Caja de Seguros Reunidos, Compañía de Seguros y 
Reaseguros, S.A that guarantees insurance cover for damage in the event of absence of 
the policy mentioned in the preceding paragraph or of insufficiency of the insured sums. 
The amount insured by that policy in relation to this issue is 1,400,000,000 euros. 
 
 
98 


 
No information is provided regarding the concentration of the insurance companies 
because the current situation of the insurance policies contracted by the obligors and 
their data are not supported in Barclays Bank, S.A.’s computer records. However, given 
the number of Mortgage Loans selected, their weighting in the total loans and their 
geographical distribution, as described in section 2.2.2.b) and h) of this Additional 
Building Block, any possible concentration of the insurance companies has not been 
deemed significant to the operation. 
Until the execution of the Deed of Establishment, Barclays Bank, S.A. will be the 
beneficiary of the damage insurance contracts taken out by the mortgage obligors 
relating to the properties mortgaged as collateral for the Mortgage Loans, up to the 
amounts insured, with each of the Mortgage Loan deeds authorising Barclays Bank, S.A., 
as mortgage creditor, in the event of default on the insurance premium payment by the 
obligor (as policyholder), to pay on behalf of the obligor the amount of the premium so 
these premiums are always paid up. By means of the Deed of Establishment, Barclays 
Bank, S.A. will formally execute the transfer associated with the issue of the PHs of its 
rights as beneficiary of said damage insurance policies subscribed by the mortgage 
obligors or any other insurance policy providing equivalent cover. Therefore the Fund, as 
holder of the PHs, will be entitled to all amounts which would have been payable to 
Barclays Bank, S.A. in this respect. 
2.2.11 Information on the obligors in those cases where the securitised assets

single obligor accounts for 20% or more of the assets, or if a single obligor

granted.

of the Mortgage Loans to the Fund effective as from that same date.  
 
 
102 


 
The assignment of the Mortgage Loans by Barclays Bank, S.A. to the Fund will not be notified 
to the obligors. However, in the event of insolvency proceedings, or any indication thereof, or 
takeover by the Bank of Spain, or liquidation or substitution of the Administrator, or where the 
Gestora deems reasonably justified, the Gestora may request that the Administrator give the 
obligors notice of the transfer to the Fund of the outstanding Mortgage Loans, and that the 
payments under the Mortgage Loans will only have discharging effect if made into the Treasury 
Account opened in the Fund’s name. Nevertheless, both if the Administrator fails to give the 
obligors notice within five (5) Business Days following receipt of the said request or in the event 
of insolvency proceedings of the Administrator, the Gestora itself, directly or, if applicable, 
through a new Administrator that it has appointed, will issue the notice to the obligors.

The multiple certificate representing the PHs will be deposited with the Financial Agent, with 
the relationship between the Issuer and the Financial Agent being governed by the Financial 
Services Agreement signed by the latter and the Gestora, on behalf of and for the account of 
the Fund. The deposit will be established for the benefit of the Fund so that the Financial Agent 
will keep the registered certificate representing the PHs in its custody following the instructions 
of the Gestora. 
The Deed of Establishment will describe the PHs and the Bonds to be issued. The Deed of 
Establishment cannot be amended (except in exceptional situations and in the conditions 
described in future regulatory implementations of Law 19/1992) and, therefore, no further 
securities issues may be carried out. 
As established in Royal Decree 685/1982, on the Regulation of the Mortgage Market, as 
amended by Royal Decree 1289/91, the PHs may be transferred by means of a written 
declaration on the certificate itself and, in general, by any of the legally admissible methods. 
The transfer of the participation and the address of the new holder must be notified by the 
transferee to Barclays Bank, S.A. 
The PHs may only be held by the investors referred to by article 64.1 of Royal Decree 685/1982 
and may not be acquired by the non-specialist public. 
The transferor shall not be liable for the solvency of the Issuer or of the obligor under the 
Mortgage Loan, nor for the sufficiency of its mortgage guarantee. 
 
 
103 


 
Barclays Bank, S.A. will keep a special book in which it will make note of the PHs issued over 
each Mortgage Loan, as well as of the transfers of the PHs notified to it, with the PHs being 
subject to what is provided in article 53 of the aforesaid Royal Decree for registered securities. 
Changes of address notified to it by the holders of the PHs will also be entered in the book. 
The book will also contain the following particulars: 
• 
date of origination and maturity of the Mortgage Loan; 
• 
initial amount of the Mortgage Loan; 
• 
form of settlement; 
• 
registry particulars of the mortgage. 
3.3.2 Terms of the assignment of the Loans 
(i) 
The assignment of the Mortgage Loans will be full and unconditional and for the whole of 
the remaining term to maturity of each Mortgage Loan. 
The Seller, in accordance with article 348 of the Code of Commerce and 1529 of the Civil 
Code, will be liable to the Fund for the existence and legitimacy of the Mortgage Loans, 
and for the personality with which the assignment is made, but shall bear no liability for 
the solvency of the obligors.  
The Seller does not bear the risk of non-payment of the Loans and therefore assumes no 
liability for default by the obligors, whether on the principal, interest or any other amount 
they may owe by virtue of the Mortgage Loans, or for the validity of any accessory 
guarantees. Nor shall it assume liability in any other way for directly or indirectly 
guaranteeing the satisfactory conclusion of the operation, or provide guarantees or 
surety bonds, or engage in substitution or repurchase agreements for the Mortgage 
Loans, except as provided in section 2.2.9 above of this Additional Building Block. 
(ii) 
The assignment of each Mortgage Loan will be done for the entire balance outstanding 
as at the date of the assignment and for all of the ordinary and default interest on each 
Loan included in the assignment.  
Specifically, and merely by way of illustration without implying any limitation, the 
assignment will confer upon the Fund the following rights in relation to each of the 
Loans: 
 
 
104 


 
a) 
to receive all amounts accruing for repayment of the principal of the Mortgage 
Loans; 
b) 
to receive all amounts accruing for ordinary interest on the principal of the 
Mortgage Loans; 
c) 
to receive all amounts accruing for default interest on the Mortgage Loans; 
d) 
to receive any other amounts, assets or rights received in payment of the principal, 
interest or expenses of the Mortgage Loans, both at auction price or an amount 
determined by a court decision or notarial procedure in the enforcement of 
mortgage or non-mortgage guarantees, as well as from the disposal or operation 
of properties or assets awarded or, as a result of such enforcements, from the 
interim administration and possession of the properties in the foreclosure process; 
and 
e) 
to receive all possible rights or indemnities arising in favour of the Seller under the 
Mortgage Loans, including those relating to such insurance policies as may be 
associated with the Mortgage Loans that are also transferred to the Fund, and 
those resulting from any accessory right of the Mortgage Loans, excluding such 
fees as may be established for each Mortgage Loan, which will remain for the 
benefit of the Seller.  
All the abovementioned rights will accrue for the benefit of the Fund as from the date the 
Deed of Establishment is executed and the PHs are issued, except for the ordinary 
interest and default interest, which shall so accrue as from the last interest payment date 
for each Mortgage Loan and as from the date of default, if applicable on the 
corresponding Mortgage Loans, respectively, both of the aforesaid dates must fall on or 
prior to the Date of Establishment. This is without prejudice to the condition that an 
amount equal to the ordinary interest accrued from the last interest payment date to the 
Date of Establishment and to such default interest as has accrued from the date of the 
default until the Date of Establishment must be paid to Barclays Bank, S.A. as provided in 
section 3.3.3. 
(iii) 
In the event the maturity of the Mortgage Loans is accelerated as a result of full or 
partial prepayment of the principal, the affected Mortgage Loans will not be substituted. 
 
 
105 


 
(iv) 
The rights of the Fund in respect of the Mortgage Loans are tied to the payments made 
by the obligors, and will therefore be directly affected by the performance, delays, 
advances or any other incidents involving the Mortgage Loans.  
(v) 
All possible expenses or costs which may be for the account of the Seller arising from 
actions for recovery in the event of non-performance by the obligors, including the 
pursuit of enforcement proceedings against the obligors, will be for the account of the 
Fund. 
(vi) 
In the event of renegotiation consented by the Gestora, on behalf of and for the account 
of the Fund, of the Mortgage Loans, or of their maturities, the modification of the 
conditions will affect the Fund.  
3.3.3 Selling or assignment price of the Loans 
The value of the principal of the PHs to be issued upon the formation of the Fund in order to be 
subscribed by the latter will be at least equal to the amount of the total Bond issue, that is, 
1,400,000,000 euros. 
The PHs will be issued at par value. The price the Fund must pay to subscribe for the PHs will 
therefore be equal to the aggregate nominal value of the principal of each PH.  
Payment of the issue price of the PHs will be made on the Bond issue Closing Date, together 
with the interest accrued at the reference interest rate applicable to the first Interest Period 
between the Date of Establishment (inclusive) and the Closing Date (exclusive). 
In addition, Barclays Bank, S.A. will have the right to receive a sum equal to the ordinary 
interest accrued on the Mortgage Loans from the last interest assessment date for each of 
them to the Date of Establishment and to such default interest as may accrue on the Mortgage 
Loans from the date of the related payment default to the Date of Establishment (the 
“Accrued Interest”). The said sum will be paid, if applicable, at the time it is received by the 
Fund. 
3.4. Explanation of the flow of funds 
3.4.1 How the cash flows from the assets will meet the Issuer’s obligations to the 
holders of the securities 
The amounts received by the Fund under the securitised assets will be paid by the 
Administrator into the Treasury Account of the Fund on the same day as they are received by 
 
 
106 


 
the Administrator, for value that same day. Consequently, the Fund will receive payments in the 
Treasury Account practically on a daily basis for the amounts received from the assets.  
Every three months, on each Payment Date, payment will be made to the Bondholders for the 
interest accrued and redemption of the Bond principal for each Class in accordance with the 
conditions established for each and with the Order of Priority of Payments set out in section 
3.4.6 of this Additional Building Block. 
3.4.2 Information on all credit enhancements 
3.4.2.1 
Description of the credit enhancement 
The credit enhancements incorporated into the financial structure of the Fund are as 
described below: 
(i) 
Reserve Fund  
Reserve Fund set up with the drawdown of the Subordinated Loan for the Establishment 
of the Reserve Fund. 
It mitigates the credit risk for non-performing and failed Mortgage Loans. 
(ii) 
Interest Rate Swap 
The purpose of the Interest Rate Swap Agreement is to neutralise the interest rate basis 
risk arising in the Fund between the floating interest rates on the Mortgage Loans 
benchmarked to the 12 month Euribor and the variable interest rates of the Securitisation 
Bond Issue benchmarked to the 3 month Euribor and with quarterly accrual and payment 
periods (except for the first Interest Period), but it does not neutralise the credit risk, 
which remains in the Fund.  
(iii) 
Treasury Account 
This partly mitigates the decrease in the return on the Fund’s cash assets caused by the 
timing mismatch between the daily income streams received from the Mortgage Loans 
and the payment of interest and redemption of principal of the Bonds on the next 
following Payment Date. 
(iv) 
Subordination and deferral 
The subordination and deferral of payment of interest and redemption of principal 
between the Bonds of the different Classes that results from their ranking in the 
 
 
107 


 
application of the Available Funds according to the Order of Priority of Payments, and the 
rules on Distribution of the Available Funds between the Bonds of each Class, or in the 
application of the Available Funds according to the Fund Liquidation Order of Priority of 
Payments, is a differentiated protective mechanism between the Classes.  
3.4.2.2 
Reserve Fund 
The Gestora, on behalf of and for the account of the Fund, will set aside a Reserve Fund 
(hereinafter, the “Reserve Fund”) using the Subordinated Loan for Establishment of the 
Reserve Fund described in section 3.4.3.1 and for an amount equal to the said Loan. 
The amount of the Reserve Fund will initially be paid into the Treasury Account. Further 
allocations, if applicable, during the life of the Fund to maintain the Required Amount, 
will be made according to the Order of Priority of Payments set out in section 3.4.6 of the 
Additional Building Block. 
The Reserve Fund will be used to perform the Fund’s payment obligations ranked 1st to 
10th in the Order of Priority of Payments set out in section 3.4.6 of the Additional Building 
Block and the Fund Liquidation Order of Priority of Payments set out in 3.4.6 of the 
Additional Building Block. 
The required Reserve Fund amount (the “Required Amount of the Reserve Fund”) 
will be determined according to the following rules:  
During the first three (3) years after the Date of Establishment of the Fund, the Required 
Amount of the Reserve Fund will be 16,800,000 euros (the “Initial Required Amount 
of the Reserve Fund”). 
Once the three (3) year term referred to by the preceding paragraph has ended, the new 
Required Amount of the Reserve Fund (the “New Required Amount of the Reserve 
Fund”) will be equal to the lower of (i) 16,800,000 euros or (ii) the largest of the 
following two amounts: 
(i) 
8,400,000 euros; or 
(ii) 
2.40% of the Outstanding Principal Balance of the Bonds of all Classes at the 
Determination Date prior to the start of the Interest Period referred to by that 
Determination Date. 
 
 
108 


 
In any event, the said reduction will not be carried out if, on the Payment Date in 
question, any of the following three circumstances exists: 
(i) 
that the Reserve Fund has been used to pay interest accrued on any of the 
Classes of Bonds on any Payment Date during the life of the Fund; or 
(ii) 
that on the Payment Date preceding the current Payment Date, the Reserve 
Fund did not contain the Required Amount of the Reserve Fund at that Payment 
Date; or 
(iii) 
that on the Determination Date for the Payment Date in course, the Outstanding 
Balance of the PHs with payments more than ninety (90) days past due is equal 
to or greater than 1% of the Outstanding Principal Balance of the Bonds of all 
Classes. 
3.4.3 Details of any subordinated debt financing 
3.4.3.1 
Subordinated Loan for Establishment of the Reserve Fund 
On behalf of and for the account of the Fund, the Gestora will execute with Barclays 
Bank PLC, Sucursal en España an “Agreement for Subordinated Loan for 
Establishment of the Reserve Fund” of SIXTEEN MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED 
THOUSAND EUROS (€ 16,800,000.00) to be used to set up the Reserve Fund.  
The “Subordinated Loan for Establishment of the Reserve Fund” will accrue a 
variable nominal interest rate fixed quarterly and equal to the sum of (i) the reference 
interest rate of the Bonds (3 month Euribor calculated as described in section 4.8.1 of 
the Securities Note or the reference rate obtained by the interpolation established for the 
first Interest Period) applicable in the relevant interest assessment period and (ii) the 
final margin of Class C. This interest will only be paid if the Fund has sufficient liquidity 
according to the Order of Priority of Payments set out in section 3.4.6 of the Additional 
Building Block and the Fund Liquidation Order of Priority of Payments stipulated in 
section 3.4.6 of the Additional Building Block. The interest accrued and payable on a 
given Payment Date will be calculated based on: (i) the actual number of days in each 
Interest Period and (ii) a three hundred sixty (360) day year. The first Payment Date on 
which, if applicable, interest will be assessed and paid on the Subordinated Loan for 
Establishment of the Reserve Fund would be 15 June 2006 or the next following Business 
Day, as applicable. By way of exception, the first interest accrual period of the 
Subordinated Loan for Establishment of the Reserve Fund will begin on the 
 
 
109 


 
commencement date of the Subscription Period and end on 15 June 2006, and the 
interest thus accrued will be calculated using the reference interest rates applicable 
during the first two Interest Periods of the Bonds. 
The interest accrued and not paid on a Payment Date will be accumulated and accrue 
default interest at the same rate as that of the Subordinated Loan for Establishment of 
the Reserve Fund and be paid provided the Fund has sufficient liquidity and according to 
the Order of Priority of Payments stipulated in section 3.4.6 of the Additional Building 
Block and to the Fund Liquidation Order of Priority of Payments stipulated in section 
3.4.6 of the Additional Building Block. 
The Subordinated Loan for Establishment of the Reserve Fund will be repaid on the Final 
Maturity Date or, as applicable, on each Payment Date, in an amount equal to the 
difference existing between the Required Amount of the Reserve Fund on the previous 
Payment Date and the Required Amount of the Reserve Fund on the current Payment 
Date. In any event, the first Payment Date on which, if applicable, repayment will begin 
of the Subordinated Loan for Establishment of the Reserve Fund would be 15 March 2009 
or the next following Business Day, if applicable. 
Given its subordinated nature, the Subordinated Loan for Establishment of the Reserve 
Fund will be deferred in ranking with respect to the other creditors of the Fund on the 
terms provided in section 3.4.6 of the Additional Building Block, including inter alia the 
Bondholders, except as refers to the Subordinated Loan for Set Up Expenses. 
3.4.3.2 
Agreement for Subordinated Loan for Set Up Expenses 
On behalf of and for the account of the Fund, the Gestora will execute with Barclays 
Bank PLC, Sucursal en España an “Agreement for Subordinated Loan for Set Up 
Expenses” of THREE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND EUROS (€ 3,500,000.00) 
that will be used to (i) pay for the expenses of setting up the Fund and issuing the 
Bonds, (ii) pay part of the subscription of the PHs and (iii) pay the interest accrued on 
the nominal value of the PHs between the Date of Establishment and the Closing Date.  
The “Subordinated Loan for Set Up Expenses” will accrue a variable nominal 
interest rate fixed quarterly and equal to the sum of (i) the reference interest rate of 
the Bonds (3 month Euribor calculated as described in section 4.8.1 of the Securities 
Note or the reference rate obtained by the interpolation established for the first Interest 
Period) applicable in the relevant interest assessment period and (ii) the final margin of 
the Class C Bonds. This interest will only be paid if the Fund has sufficient liquidity 
 
 
110 


 
according to the Order of Priority of Payments set out in section 3.4.6 of the Additional 
Building Block and with the Fund Liquidation Order of Priority of Payments stipulated in 
section 3.4.6 of the Additional Building Block. The interest accrued and payable on a 
given Payment Date will be calculated based on: (i) the actual number of days in each 
Interest Period and (ii) a three hundred sixty (360) day year. The first Payment Date on 
which, if applicable, interest will be assessed and paid on the Subordinated Loan for Set 
Up Expenses would be 15 June 2006 or the next following Business Day, as applicable. 
By way of exception, the first interest accrual period of the Subordinated Loan for Set 
Up Expenses will begin on the commencement date of the Subscription Period and end 
on 15 June 2006, and the interest thus accrued will be calculated using the reference 
interest rates applicable during the first two Interest Periods of the Bonds. 
The interest accrued and not paid on a Payment Date will be accumulated and accrue 
default interest at the same rate as that of Subordinated Loan for Set Up Expenses and 
be paid provided the Fund has sufficient liquidity and according to the Order of Priority 
of Payments stipulated in section 3.4.6 of the Additional Building Block and to the Fund 
Liquidation Order of Priority of Payments stipulated in section 3.4.6 of the Additional 
Building Block. 
The Subordinated Loan for Set Up Expenses will be repaid on each Payment Date, as 
from 15 June 2006, in an amount proportional to the days actually contained in each 
Interest Period, on the basis of 1,825 days (that is, 5 years on a 365-day year basis), 
so that it will be full amortised within five (5) years after the Date of Establishment, 
provided the Fund has sufficient liquidity to do so according to the Order of Priority of 
Payments stipulated in section 3.4.6 of the Securities Note and to the Fund Liquidation 
Order of Priority of Payments stipulated in section 3.4.6 of the Additional Building Block. 
If the initial expenses of setting up the Fund and issuing the Bonds and the amount of 
interest for deferring the payment of the PHs subscription price are less than the 
amount of the Subordinated Loan for Set Up Expenses, the repayment of the principal 
of the Subordinated Loan for Set Up Expenses that is not used will be done on the first 
Payment Date on which the Subordinated Loan for Set Up Expenses is repaid, all of the 
above according to the exceptional rules on priority of payments by the Fund of section 
3.4.6 of the Additional Building Block and to the exceptional rules on priority of 
payments by the Fund in the event of the latter’s liquidation that are set out in section 
3.4.6 of the Additional Building Block. The amount of the principal of the Subordinated 
Loan for Set Up Expenses that is not used will form part of the Available Funds at the 
first Payment Date. 
 
 
111 


 
Given its subordinated nature, the Subordinated Loan for Set Up Expenses will be 
deferred in ranking with respect to the other creditors of the Fund on the terms 
provided in section 3.4.6 of the Additional Building Block, including inter alia the 
Bondholders. 
3.4.3.3 
Subordination of the Bonds of Class B and Class C 
The Class A2 Bonds are junior to the Class A1 Bonds as regards redemption of the 
principal, whereas the interest on both classes will be paid pro rata. 
The Class B Bonds are junior to the Class A1 and A2 Bonds as regards payment of 
interest and redemption of principal, in accordance with the Order of Priority of Payments 
and the Fund Liquidation Order of Priority of Payments, except in the event of pro rata 
redemption with the principal of Class A2. 
The Class C Bonds are junior to the Class A1, A2 and B Bonds as regards payment of 
interest and redemption of principal, in accordance with the Order of Priority of Payments 
and the Fund Liquidation Order of Priority of Payments, except in the events of pro rata 
redemption with the principal of Class A2 and B. 
Sections 4.6.1 and 4.6.2 of the Securities Note give the details on how interest payments 
and principal redemption for the Bonds of each Class are ranked in the Order of Priority 
of Payments.  
3.4.4 
Parameters for the investment of temporary liquidity surpluses and a 
description of the parties responsible for this investment 
3.4.4.1 
Treasury Account 
The Gestora, on behalf of and for the account of the Fund, and Barclays Bank, S.A. (as 
Financial Agent) will enter into a Financial Services Agreement whereunder the sums 
deposited by the Fund through its Gestora in the Treasury Account held with the 
Financial Agent will accrue interest at a rate equal to the monthly average of the EONIA 
rate (Euro Overnight Index Average), calculated by the European Central Bank and 
posted by REUTERS on its EONIA page, for the previous month. 
The balances of Treasury Account must be maintained in euros. 
Specifically, the Financial Services Agreement will determine the amounts to be received 
by the Fund in respect of: 
 
 
112 


 
(i) 
principal and interest of the PHs; 
(ii) 
any amounts received in payment of the principal, ordinary and default interest, or 
expenses of the Mortgage Loans, both at auction price or an amount determined 
by court decision or notarial procedure in the enforcement of mortgage 
guarantees, or from the disposal or operation of the properties or assets awarded 
as a result of such enforcements, from the interim administration and possession 
of the properties in the foreclosure process, as well as all possible rights or 
indemnities arising in favour of the Issuer, including not only those relating to 
insurance policies transferred by the Issuer to the Fund, but also those resulting 
from any accessory loan right; 
(iii) 
amount of the principal of the foreclosed Mortgage Loans, as from the date of the 
property’s disposal, acquisition at the auction price or amount determined by court 
decision, or notarial procedure; 
(iv) 
the returns obtained on the balances held in the Treasury Account itself;  
(v) 
such withholdings on account of investment income as may have to be applied in 
accordance with the legislation prevailing from time to time during the life of the 
Fund on each Payment Date in respect of the interest paid by the Fund on the 
Bonds, until those withholdings must be paid to the tax administration;  
(vi) 
the amount of the Reserve Fund; and 
(vii) any other sums that form part of the Fund’s assets from time to time will be 
deposited in the Treasury Account initially opened in Barclays Bank, S.A. (Financial 
Agent), in the name of the Fund, by the Gestora.  
The balances in the Treasury Account will accrue interest at a rate equal to the monthly 
average of the EONIA rate (Euro Overnight Index Average) calculated by the European 
Central Bank and posted by REUTERS on its EONIA page, for the previous month. This 
interest will be settled monthly. 
Under the Financial Services Agreement, the Financial Agent will also assume custody of 
the Multiple Certificate representing the PHs subscribed by the Fund. 
In the event that the short-term non-subordinated and unsecured debt of Barclays Bank 
PLC is given at any time a rating of less than A-1, P-1 or F-1, according to the S&P, 
Moody’s and Fitch rating scales for short-term debt, respectively, or if Barclays Bank 
 
 
113 


 
PLC’s interest in the share capital of the Financial Agent is at any time less than 51%, the 
Financial Agent must, within thirty (30) Business Days after the said lower rating is 
assigned or after the decline of Barclays Bank PLC’s equity stake in the Financial Agent to 
below the aforesaid percentage, either: 
(a) 
obtain from a credit institution whose short-term debt has ratings of A-1, P-1 and 
F1 or better according to the S&P, Moody’s and Fitch rating scales for short-term 
risk, respectively, a first demand guarantee as security for the amounts deposited 
in the Treasury Account; or 
(b) 
transfer the Treasury Account of the Fund to an entity whose non-subordinated 
and unsecured short-term debt has minimum ratings of A-1, P-1 and F1 (according 
to the S&P, Moody’s and Fitch rating scales, respectively), and contract for the 
highest return possible for the balances of the Treasury Account; or 
(c) 
if options (a) and (b) above are not possible, the Gestora will obtain from the 
Financial Agent or a third party a pledge guarantee for the benefit of the Fund 
over the financial assets with credit quality not below that of the Public Debt 
securities of the Spanish Government, in a sufficient amount to guarantee the 
obligations established in the Financial Services Agreement; or 
(d) 
if the measures cited above are not viable, the Gestora will replace the Financial 
Agent with another credit institution whose short-term debt has minimum ratings 
of A-1, P-1 and F1, according to the aforementioned scales, and contract for the 
highest return possible for the balances of the Treasury Account. 
In event (b) above, the Gestora will again transfer the balances of the Treasury Account 
to the Financial Agent, provided that the non-subordinated and unsecured short-term 
debt of Barclays Bank PLC has the said A-1, P-1 and F1 ratings and Barclays Bank PLC 
holds an equity stake in the Financial Agent of 51% or more. 
In no event may the substitution of the Financial Agent have a negative effect on the 
Bonds’ ratings. 
Similarly, if the credit rating of non-subordinated and unsecured short-term debt of 
Barclays Bank PLC is downgraded to A-1 (according to the S&P rating scale for short-
term risks), if the balance of the Treasury Account is more than 20% of the Outstanding 
Principal Balance of the Bonds on a given Payment Date, the Gestora will transfer the 
surplus over the said 20% to the Cash Surplus Account opened by the Gestora in another 
 
 
114 


 
credit institution whose short-term debt has a minimum rating of A-1+, P-1 and F1 
according to the S&P, Moody’s and Fitch short-term rating scales, respectively, and 
contract the highest possible return for that balance.  
Furthermore, if the non-subordinated and unsecured short-term debt of Barclays Bank 
PLC recovers the A-1+ rating (according to the S&P rating scale for short-term risks), the 
Gestora will once again transfer the balance of the Cash Surplus Account to the Treasury 
Account held in the Financial Agent. 
3.4.5 Collection by the Fund of payments in respect of the assets 
The Administrator, as collections manager, will receive for the account of the Gestora, on behalf 
of and for the account of the Fund, all sums paid by the mortgage obligors under the Mortgage 
Loans, in respect of principal, interest or any other item, including the insurance contracts 
assigned to the Gestora, on behalf of and for the account of the Fund, which are owed by 
virtue of the Mortgage Loans and will deposit the amounts to which the Fund is entitled, for 
value that same day, in the Treasury Account. 
The Administrator will likewise pay into that account and subject to that same time limit, such 
amounts as may be received from the mortgage obligors by way of prepayment of the 
Mortgage Loans to which the Fund is entitled. Conversely, the Administrator will not pay the 
fees it receives, where such is the case, from the mortgage obligors for the prepayment of the 
Mortgage Loans, as Barclays Bank, S.A. will be entitled to those fees as issuer of the PHs. 
In this regard, in accordance with article 1527 of the Civil Code, it is noted that an obligor who 
makes payments to the original creditor before learning of the assignment will be discharged 
from the obligation.

3.4.7 Other arrangements upon which payments of interest and principal to 
investors are dependent 
3.4.7.1 
Interest Rate Swap Agreement 
On behalf of and for the account of the Fund, the Gestora will enter into, with Barclays 
Bank PLC, Sucursal en España, an interest rate swap contract (“Interest Rate Swap 
Agreement”) in the form of the Master Agreement for Financial Transactions of the 
Asociación Española de Banca (Spanish Banking Association), the most significant 
features of which are described below: 
 
 
123 


 
The purpose of the Interest Rate Swap Agreement is to neutralise the interest rate basis 
risk arising in the Fund between the floating interest rates on the Mortgage Loans 
benchmarked to the 12 month Euribor and the variable interest rates of the Bond issue 
benchmarked to the 3 month Euribor and with quarterly accrual and payment periods 
(except for the first Interest Period, in which the reference interest rate will be the 
interpolation of the 3 month Euribor and the 4 month Euribor), but it does not neutralise 
the credit risk, which remains in the Fund.  
The credit risk arising from non-performance on the Mortgage Loans is protected, first of 
all, through the Subordinated Loan for Establishment of the Reserve Fund and, second, 
by the subordinated structure of the Class A1, A2, B and C Bonds, both as regards 
payment of interest and repayment of principal, according to the Order of Priority of 
Payments of the Fund. 
The swap will function as described below, in the understanding that the settlement will 
be for net balances: 
Party A: The Fund, represented by the Gestora. 
Party B: Barclays Bank PLC, Sucursal en España 
1. 
Settlement date 
The settlement dates (“Settlement Dates”) will fall on the same days as the 
Determination Dates.  
2. 
Settlement period 
Party A: 
The “Settlement Periods” for Party A will be the days actually contained between two 
consecutive Settlement Dates, including the first but not including the second. By way of 
exception, the first Settlement Period for Party A will have a duration equal to the period 
between the Date of Establishment (inclusive) and the first Determination Date 
(exclusive). 
Party B: 
The Settlement Periods for Party B will be the days actually contained between two 
consecutive Settlement Dates, including the first but not including the second. By way of 
exception, the first Settlement Period for Party B will have a duration equal to the period 
 
 
124 


 
between the Date of Establishment (inclusive) and the first Determination Date 
(exclusive). 
3. 
Amounts payable by Party A. 
On each Payment Date, Party A will pay an amount equal to the sum of all amounts paid 
into the Treasury Account and, if applicable, in the Cash Surplus Account of the Fund in 
respect of ordinary and default interest on the PHs during the Settlement Period. 
The following will not be considered ordinary or default interest, and are expressly 
excluded from calculation of the amount payable by Party A: (i) the Accrued Interest 
arising at the time of the initial sale of the PHs, and (ii) the interest accrued, both 
ordinary and default, prior to their subscription date, on the new PHs to be issued by 
Barclays Bank, S.A. in connection with the substitution of PHs according to the rules laid 
down in the Deed of Establishment of the Fund and in section 2.2.9 of the Additional 
Building Block. 
The sum of the amounts payable by Party A will be referred to as the “Sum Payable by 
Party A”. 
4. 
Amounts payable by Party B 
On each Payment Date, Party B will pay an amount yielded by applying the following 
rules: 
1. 
The “Individual Notional Amounts” will be calculated for each Mortgage 
Loan for which the ordinary and default interest received by the Fund during 
the Settlement Period have been paid. This will be done by dividing (i) the 
sums received by the Fund in respect of ordinary and default interest on each 
of the Mortgage Loans, by (ii) the reference annual interest rate applied to the 
Mortgage Loan, plus a margin of 45 basis points (0.45%). The result of this 
division will be the Individual Notional Amount of each Mortgage Loan. 
2. 
The Individual Notional Amounts will be added up to obtain the aggregate sum. 
The result will be the “Notional Amount for the Settlement Period”. 
3. 
Party B will pay an amount equal to the result of multiplying the Notional 
Amount for the Settlement Period by the 3 month EURIBOR interest rate (or 
the interpolation of the 3 month EURIBOR and 4 month EURIBOR for the first 
Settlement Period, as stipulated for the calculation of the reference interest rate 
 
 
125 


 
for the first Interest Period) prevailing at the Interest Rate Fixing Date 
immediately following the Determination Date that marked the start of the 
Settlement Period, plus 43 basis points (0.43%). That amount will be the “Sum 
Payable by Party B”. 
The Sum Payable by Party B will be calculated according to the duration of the 
Settlement Period and on the basis of a 360-day year. The 3 month EURIBOR 
interest rate (and the interpolation for the first Interest Period) will be 
calculated on the dates and according to the procedures stipulated for 
calculating the EURIBOR reference interest rate in section 4.8.1 of the 
Securities Note.  
5. 
Net amount payable 
On each Settlement Date there will accrue a single amount to be paid, payable on the 
next following Payment Date, whether by Party A to Party B, or vice versa (hereinafter, 
the “Net Amount”). 
The Net Amount payable by Party A to Party B will be the positive difference between the 
Sum Payable by Party A and the Sum Payable by Party B. 
The Net Amount payable by Party B to Party A will be the positive difference between the 
Sum Payable by Party B and the Sum Payable by Party A. 
If on a given Settlement Date the Sum Payable by Party B and the Sum Payable by Party 
A are the same, there will be no Net Amount to be paid by either Party to the other on 
the next following Payment Date. 
6. 
Additional provisions 
If on a Payment Date the Fund does not have sufficient liquidity to pay the whole of the 
amount payable to Barclays Bank PLC, Sucursal en España, the amount not paid will be 
accumulated and accrue default interest at the same rate as that of the Subordinated 
Loans for Set Up Expenses and Establishment of the Reserve Fund, and will be paid on 
the next Payment Date on which the Fund has sufficient liquidity according to the Order 
of Priority of Payments stipulated in section 3.4.6 of the Additional Building Block and the 
exception rules set out in section 3.4.6 of the Additional Building Block. 
If the credit ratings for the non-subordinated and unsecured short-term debt of Barclays 
Bank PLC are downgraded, at any time during the life of the Bond issue, to below A-1, P-
 
 
126 


 
1 or F1 (its current ratings being A-1+, P-1 and F1+) on the S&P, Moody’s and Fitch 
rating scales for short-term risks, or if the ratings for the non-subordinated and 
unsecured long-term debt of Barclays Bank PLC are downgraded, at any time during the 
life of the Bond issue, to below A2 or A (its current ratings being Aa1 and AA+) on the 
Moody’s and Fitch rating scales for long-term risks, Barclays Bank PLC, Sucursal en 
España, within a maximum of thirty (30) days after the said circumstance takes place:  
(i) 
will either obtain from a credit institution whose non-subordinated and unsecured 
short-term debt has minimum ratings of A-1, P-1 and F1 on the S&P, Moody’s and 
Fitch rating scales for short-term risks and whose non-subordinated and unsecured 
long-term debt has minimum ratings of A2 and A on the Moody’s and Fitch rating 
scales for long-term risks, a first demand guarantee for the obligations of Barclays 
Bank PLC, Sucursal en España, under this Agreement; or  
(ii) 
make a cash or securities deposit pledged for the benefit of the Fund as security 
for the obligations of Barclays Bank PLC, Sucursal en España for such amount, 
calculated according to the market value of each operation in particular, as allows 
there to be maintained the ratings assigned to each Class of Bonds as required by 
the Rating Agencies Swap Policies in force at that time; or 
(iii) 
if the above measures are not viable, it will arrange for a third party whose non-
subordinated and unsecured short-term debt has minimum ratings of A-1, P-1 and 
F1 on the S&P, Moody’s and Fitch rating scales for short-term risks, and whose 
non-subordinated and unsecured long-term debt has minimum ratings of A2 and A 
on the Moody’s and Fitch rating scales for long-term risks, to assume the 
contractual position of Barclays Bank PLC, Sucursal en España, in the Interest Rate 
Swap Agreement, whether by its subrogation to that Agreement, or by entering 
into a new contract on terms and conditions identical in all material respects to 
that Agreement and to the affected operations. 
If the ratings of the non-subordinated and unsecured short-term debt of Barclays Bank 
PLC are downgraded, at any time during the life of the Bond issue, to below P-2 or F2 on 
the Moody’s and Fitch rating scales for short-term risks, or if the rating of the non-
subordinated and unsecured long-term debt of Barclays Bank PLC are downgraded, at 
any time during the life of the Bond issue, to below BBB, A3 or BBB+ on the S&P, 
Moody’s and Fitch rating scales for long-term risks, only option (iii) above will be valid, 
and Barclays Bank PLC, Sucursal en España will have to make the deposit provided for in 
option (ii) within a maximum of ten (10) days after the occurrence of the said 
 
 
127 


 
circumstance, until a third party replaces it in its contractual position in the Interest Rate 
Swap Agreement within a maximum of thirty (30) days after the occurrence of the said 
circumstance. 
For these purposes, the “Rating Agencies Swap Policies” will be the official policy 
respectively published by S&P, Moody’s and Fitch and in force from time to time, in which 
the standards for quantifying the amount of the deposit referred to in section (ii) above 
are defined. 
In any event, the above options must not have a negative impact on the ratings assigned 
by S&P, Moody’s and Fitch to each of the A1, A2, B and C Bond Classes. 
The early termination of the Interest Rate Swap Agreement (for example, due to serious 
breach by Barclays Bank PLC, Sucursal en España of its obligations or to supervening 
objective circumstances affecting Barclays Bank PLC, Sucursal en España) will not on its 
own be an event of accelerated redemption of the Bonds or early liquidation of the Fund, 
unless in conjunction with other events or circumstances relating to the financial position 
of the Fund there is a substantial or permanent disruption of its financial balance. In the 
event of early termination of the Interest Rate Swap Agreement, payment of such 
Settlement Amount as may be payable to Barclays Bank PLC, Sucursal en España will be 
ranked 12th in the Order of Priority of Payments stipulated in section 3.4.6 of the 
Additional Building Block, and eleventh (11th) in the Fund Liquidation Order of Priority of 
Payments stipulated in section 3.4.6 of the Additional Building Block. 
The Interest Rate Swap Agreement will be rescinded and absolutely null and void if any 
of the Rating Agencies does not confirm prior to the start of the Subscription Period the 
provisional ratings assigned to each of the Classes as final. 
7. 
Key aspects 
(i) 
The settlements received by Barclays Bank PLC, Sucursal en España are 
determined on a “cash” basis in the sense that they consist of interest actually 
paid into the Treasury Account and, if applicable, in the Cash Surplus Account, 
within each Settlement Period of the swap, which determine the amounts the 
Fund pays to Barclays Bank PLC, Sucursal en España on each Payment Date. 
(ii) 
The settlements paid by Barclays Bank PLC, Sucursal en España on each 
Payment Date are also determined on a “cash” basis, given that the notional 
 
 
128 


 
amount is taken to be the variable amount payable by Party A in each 
Settlement Period, which is tied to a “cash” criteria. 
(iii) 
If Barclays Bank PLC, Sucursal en España is replaced as counterparty in the 
Interest Rate Swap Agreement, the references made to Barclays Bank PLC,

3.7. Administrator, calculation agent or equivalent 
3.7.1 Management, administration and representation of the Fund and of the 
holders of the securities 
In accordance with article 5.2 of Law 19/1992, the administration and legal representation of 
the Fund rests with the Gestora on the terms set out in Law 19/1992 and other applicable laws 
and regulations, without prejudice to the provisions of the Deed of Establishment. The creation 
of the Gestora was authorised by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Finance on 16 July 1993 
and it is registered in the Special Register of the CNMV with number 5.  
The obligations and activities that the Gestora will perform as part of its administration and 
legal representation of the Fund include, by way of illustration and without implying any 
limitation: 
(i) 
Open in the name of the Fund the bank account (hereinafter, the “Treasury Account”) 
referred to in section 3.4.4.1 of the Additional Building Block initially with the Financial 
Agent and, when appropriate, the Cash Surplus Account.  
The balance of this account will accrue interest at a rate equal to the monthly average of 
the EONIA rate (Euro Overnight Index Average) calculated by the European Central Bank 
and posted by REUTERS on its EONIA page, for the previous month. This interest will be 
settled monthly. 
(ii) 
Adopt the appropriate measures to have the amounts it receives in respect of principal 
and interest and any other sum owed to the Fund to be deposited in the Treasury 
Account. 
(iii) 
Ensure that the amounts deposited in the Treasury Account earn the return established 
in the Financial Services Agreement and that any amounts deposited in the Cash Surplus 
Account earn the return agreed for that balance. 
(iv) 
Calculate on each Rate Fixing Date, with respect to the following Interest Period, the 
Nominal Interest Rate applicable to all of the Bond Classes, as a result of the 
determination made in accordance with section 4.8.1 of the Securities Note, and disclose 
it in the manner stipulated in section 4.1.1 of the Additional Building Block. 
(v) 
Calculate on each Determination Date the principal to be redeemed of all of the Bond 
Classes and, along with the interest accrued in accordance with section 4.8.2 of the 
 
 
132 


 
Registration Document, give notice thereof in the manner stipulated in section 4.1.1 of 
the Additional Building Block. 
(vi) 
Allocate the Available Funds (referred to in section 3.4.6 of the Additional Building Block), 
and any other amount available in the Treasury Account and, if applicable, in the Cash 
Surplus Account, on each date, to the performance of the payment or withholding 
obligations of the Fund, on the terms and in the Order of Priority of Payments set out in 
section 3.4.6 of the Additional Building Block and the exceptional rules stipulated in 
section 3.4.6 of the Additional Building Block or in the Fund Liquidation Order of Priority 
of Payments stipulated in section 3.4.6 of the Additional Building Block and the 
exceptional rules stipulated in section 3.4.6 of the Additional Building Block. 
(vii) 
In the event that at any time during the life of the Fund the credit ratings of Barclays 
Bank PLC or its equity holding in Barclays Bank, S.A. are downgraded below the limits 
indicated in section 5.2.1 of the Securities Note, Barclays Bank, S.A. will be substituted as 
Financial Agent by another credit institution whose short-term debt has minimum ratings 
of P-1 on the Moody’s rating scale for short-term risks, of A-1 on the S&P rating scale for 
short-term risks and of F1 on the Fitch rating scale for short-term risks (in which event, 
the Gestora will transfer to the substitute the Treasury Account and contract the highest 
possible return for the balances of the account), unless the Financial Agent, within thirty 
(30) Business Days after the assignment of the lower credit rating or decline in Barclays 
Bank PLC’s equity stake in the Financial Agent to below 51%: (i) either obtains from a 
credit institution whose short-term debt has the said minimum ratings a first demand 
guarantee securing for the Fund, at the simple request of the Gestora, the amounts 
deposited in the Treasury Account, or (ii) transfers the Treasury Account of the Fund to 
an entity whose non-subordinated and unsecured short-term debt must have minimum 
ratings of A-1, P-1 and F1 (on the S&P, Moody’s and Fitch rating scales for short-term 
risks, respectively), contracting the highest possible return for the balances of the 
Treasury Account, or (iii) if options (i) and (ii) above are not possible, the Gestora 
obtains from the Financial Agent or a third party a pledge guarantee for the benefit of 
the Fund over financial assets with credit quality not below that of the Public Debt 
securities of the Spanish Government, in a sufficient amount to guarantee the 
commitments established in the Financial Services Agreement. In event (ii) above, the 
Gestora will again transfer the balances of the Treasury Account to the Financial Agent, 
provided that the non-subordinated and unsecured short-term debt of Barclays Bank PLC 
has the said A-1, P-1 and F1 ratings and Barclays Bank PLC holds an equity stake in the 
Financial Agent of 51% or more. In no event may the substitution of the Financial Agent 
have a negative effect on the Bonds’ ratings. Similarly, if the credit rating of non-
 
 
133 


 
subordinated and unsecured short-term debt of Barclays Bank PLC is downgraded to A-1 
(according to the S&P rating scale for short-term risks), if the balance of the Treasury 
Account is more than 20% of the Outstanding Principal Balance of the Bonds on a given 
Payment Date, the Gestora will transfer and pay the surplus over the said 20% into the 
Cash Surplus Account opened by the Gestora in another credit institution whose short-
term debt has minimum ratings of A-1+, P-1 and F1 on the S&P, Moody’s and Fitch 
short-term scales, and contract the highest possible return for that balance. Furthermore, 
if the non-subordinated and unsecured short-term debt of Barclays Bank PLC recovers 
the A-1+ rating (according to the S&P rating scale for short-term risks), the Gestora will 
once again transfer to the Treasury Account held in the Financial Agent the balance of 
the Cash Surplus Account. 
(viii) Appoint the auditors of the Fund and, as appropriate, revoke their appointment and 
replace them. 
(ix) 
Manage the Fund with the objective that its net assets be zero at all times. 
(x) 
To adopt appropriate decisions in relation to liquidation of the Fund, including the 
decision for the early liquidation of the Fund in accordance with the provisions of this 
Prospectus and of the Deed of Establishment. 
(xi) 
Pursue its activity with the diligence required in accordance with Royal Decree 926/1998, 
of 14 May 1998, representing the Fund and defending the interests of the Bondholders 
and of the rest of the Fund’s ordinary creditors as if they were its own interests, exerting 
the utmost diligence and providing the highest level of information and defence of their 
interests and avoiding situations that involve conflicts of interest, giving priority to the 
interests of the Bondholders and of the rest of the ordinary creditors of the Fund over the 
interests of third parties and over its own interests. For these purposes, and without 
prejudice to the foregoing, the Gestora may act as management company for other 
Securitisation Funds, without such simultaneous management constituting in any way a 
violation of its duties of diligence as Gestora of the Fund or other Securitisation Funds. 
(xii) 
Arrange to have the necessary resources, including the appropriate information systems, 
to carry on the Fund administration functions attributed to it by Royal Decree 926/1998. 
(xiii) The Gestora complies with the applicable code of conduct. The Gestora has established a 
code of conduct in compliance with the provisions of Chapter II of Royal Decree 
629/1993, of 3 May 1993 on rules of conduct in securities markets and mandatory 
 
 
134 


 
recordkeeping. That code of conduct has been adapted to the provisions of Law 44/2002, 
of 22 November 2002 on Measures for Reform of the Financial System.  
(xiv) Check that the information received by the Administrator on amounts fallen due, 
amounts collected, amounts not paid, prepayments of principal and recoveries of unpaid 
instalments and other possible revenues is consistent with the amounts actually received 
in the Treasury Account of the Fund. 
(xv) Provide the Bondholders, the CNMV and the Rating Agencies will all such information and 
notices as provided by the applicable legislation, and specifically those envisaged in this 
Prospectus, in the manner established for each. 
(xvi) Notify the mortgage obligors of the change of Administrator if Barclays Bank, S.A. is 
substituted as Administrator of the Mortgage Loans. For this purpose, the Administrator 
has undertaken to cooperate with the utmost diligence in issuing all such notices as must 
be given to the obligors under the Mortgage Loans in order to disclose the appointment 
of the new administrator, the changes in the accounts in which the direct debits will be 
made for the Mortgage Loans and, in general, the changes in the collection management 
process that may be needed to ensure that the Fund suffers no harm, all according to 
the instructions it receives from the Gestora. 
Resignation and substitution of the Gestora 
The resignation and substitution of the Gestora will be governed by the provisions of 
articles 18 and 19 of Royal Decree 926/1998, of 14 May 1998, regulating asset 
securitisation funds and companies managing securitisation funds, or by the laws and 
regulations prevailing from time to time. The Gestora may voluntarily request to be 
substituted when it deems appropriate by submitting a written request to the CNMV, 
specifying the appointment of the substitute management company and accompanied by 
a statement by the new securitisation funds management company, duly authorised and 
registered in the Special Register of the CNMV, in which the substitute declares it is 
prepared to accept that function. The Gestora’s resignation and the appointment of the 
new management company will require the approval of the CNMV. The Gestora cannot 
cease performing its functions until all requirements and procedures for the appointment 
of its substitute have been completed. All expenses generated as a result of the 
substitution will be borne by the Gestora itself and will in no event be passed on to the 
Fund. 
 
 
135 


 
if the Gestora is declared subject to insolvency proceedings or its authorisation is 
revoked, it must find a management company to replace it and the management and 
representation of the Fund will fall to the new management company, in compliance with 
the terms of articles 18 and 19 of Royal Decree 926/1998, of 14 May 1998, referred to 
above. 
Expiry of the four (4) month time limit established in article 19.2 of the aforesaid Royal 
Decree after the event requiring the substitution without a new Gestora having been 
found will constitute an event of early liquidation of the Fund and redemption of the 
Bonds, and the actions provided in section 4.4 of the Securities Registration Document 
must be carried out. 
The substitution of the Gestora and appointment of a new management company, once 
approved by the CNMV, will be notified to the Rating Agencies. 
The Bondholders will only be entitled to bring actions against the Gestora for failure to 
perform its functions or for non-compliance with the provisions of the Deed of 
Establishment the Fund. 
Remuneration of the Gestora 
The Gestora, in accordance with Law 19/1992, will establish, represent and manage the 
Fund. As consideration for these functions, the Fund will pay the Gestora an 
Administration Fee composed of an Initial Fee and a Periodic Fee. 
The Deed of Establishment will stipulate that the Gestora is entitled to an Initial 
Administration Fee of 90,000 euros, to be paid in full on the Closing Date. 
The Deed of Establishment will also provide that the Gestora will be entitled on each 
Payment Date of the Bonds to a Periodic Administration Fee of 0.02% per annum of the 
amounts of the PHs pending repayment on the Determination Date for the previous 
Payment Date, subject to a minimum of 30,050 euros and a maximum of 150,000 euros 
per year.  
The Fee payable on any given Payment Date will be determined by applying the following 
formula: 
C = B x 0.02% x d/365 
where: 
 
 
136 


 
C = Fee payable on a given Payment Date. 
B = Sum of the amounts of the outstanding PHs as at the previous Determination Date. 
d = Number of days in the accrual period of reference (except for the first accrual period, 
for which there will be considered the days from the Date of Establishment to the first 
Payment Date). 
If during the life of the Fund, the General National Consumer Price Index (Índice 
Nacional General de Precios al Consumo) published by the Instituto Nacional de 
Estadística (Spanish Institute of Statistics) for the calendar year rises, the minimum 
annual amount will be revised cumulatively accordingly (with the revision of the minimum 
amount being based on the increase recorded by the General National Consumer Price 
Index for the previous year) as from 2006, inclusive, and effective on 1 January of each 
year. 
The fees referred to in the preceding paragraphs rank first (1st) in the Order of Priority of 
Payments set out in section 3.4.6 of the Additional Building Block, and first (1st) in the 
Fund Liquidation Order of Priority of Payments stipulated in section 3.4.6 of the 
Additional Building Block. 
If on a Payment Date the Fund does not have sufficient liquidity to pay the Periodic 
Administration Fee, the amount owed will accrue interest at a rate equal to the sum of (i) 
the reference interest rate of the Bonds (3 month Euribor calculated as described in 
section 4.8.1 of the Securities Note or the reference rate obtained by the interpolation 
provided for the first Interest Period) applicable in the period of reference plus (ii) the 
final margin of the Class C Bonds, which will be paid on the following Payment Date, 
provided the Fund has sufficient liquidity, according to the Order of Priority of Payments 
of section 3.4.6 of the Additional Building Block and to the Fund Liquidation Order of 
Priority of Payments stipulated in section 3.4.6 of the Additional Building Block. 
All payments to third parties in respect of ordinary expenses (such as the annual audits 
of the Fund, publications and others) and extraordinary expenses relating to the 
management of the Fund will be paid by the Gestora, on behalf of and for the account of 
the Fund, provided the Fund has sufficient liquidity to do so, according to the Order of 
Priority of Payments of section 3.4.6 of the Additional Building Block and to the Fund 
Liquidation Order of Priority of Payments stipulated in section 3.4.6 of the Additional 
Building Block. 
 
 
137 


 
3.7.2 Administration and custody of the securitised assets 
Barclays Bank undertakes to perform the custody and administration of the Mortgage Loans 
according to article 61.3 of the Royal Decree 685/1982, with the relations between Barclays 
Bank, S.A. and the Fund being governed by the Mortgage Loans Administration Agreement 
(hereinafter, the “Administration Agreement”) to be signed by Barclays Bank, S.A 
(hereinafter as regards that Agreement, the “Administrator”) and the Gestora, on behalf of 
and for the account of the Fund. 
The Administrator will continue managing the Mortgage Loans dedicating the same time and 
attention to them and applying the same level of expertise, care and diligence in their 
administration as it would dedicate and apply to the administration of Mortgage Loans with 
respect to which it has not issued mortgage participations and, in any event, will apply an 
adequate level of expertise, care and diligence in the performance of the services covered by 
the Administration Agreement. 
The Administrator in any event waives the rights and powers legally conferred on it in its 
capacity as collections manager for the Fund and Administrator of the Mortgage Loans and in 
particular those contained in articles 1730 and 1780 of the Civil Code and article 276 of the 
Code of Commerce. 
A concise description of the rules and ordinary procedures of administration and custodianship 
(the “Services”) of the Mortgage Loans regulated by the Deed of Establishment is contained in 
the following subsections: 
3.7.2.1 
Rules and ordinary procedures for administration and management of the 
Mortgage Loans 
1. 
Administration 
The Administrator will maintain custody and administration of the Mortgage Loans and 
receive, for collection management for the account of the Fund, all amounts paid by the 
mortgage obligors under the Mortgage Loans, and immediately deposit the amounts that 
belong to the Fund in the bank account held by the Fund in its name in the Administrator 
(the Treasury Account). 
2. 
Term 
 
 
138 


 
The Administrator will provide the Services until of the Mortgage Loans have been fully 
amortised and all of the obligations assumed by the Administrator in relation to the PHs 
have been discharged.  
In the event of insolvency proceedings or liquidation of the Administrator, the Gestora 
may, provided it is legally possible, appoint a new administrator of the Mortgage Loans, 
who must accept the obligations provided in the Administration Agreement. The Rating 
Agencies must be given prior notice of the appointment of the new administrator and be 
given detailed information on the new administrator and on the costs associated with the 
substitution. In order to avoid harm to the Fund and/or to the Bondholders, if the 
Administrator must be substituted in the administration of the Mortgage Loans according 
to the terms of this paragraph, it shall continue performing its functions until the time the 
said substitution is effectively made. 
Once the substitution has been carried out, the Administrator shall place at the disposal 
of the new administrator the documents and electronic records needed for the latter to 
perform the Services. 
If the non-subordinated and unsecured short-term debt of Barclays Bank PLC is at any 
time assigned a credit rating of below A-1 on the S&P rating scale for short-term risks, or 
if Barclays Bank PLC’s equity stake in the Administrator is at any time less than 51%, the 
Gestora will adopt any measure needed to maintain the ratings assigned to the Bonds at 
that time. The Administrator, for its part, undertakes to accept the measures adopted by 
the Gestora pursuant to the authority provided here. 
3. 
Subcontracting 
Upon prior authorisation from the Gestora and by means of signing a service agreement, 
the Administrator may subcontract to a third party any of the Services it has undertaken 
to provide, except for those which by law cannot be delegated. In any event, the 
Administrator shall bear the ultimate responsibility for the proper management of those 
services as provided in Law 2/1981, of 25 March 1981, on the Regulation of the 
Mortgage Market and Royal Decree 685/1982, of 17 March 1982, as amended by Royal 
Decree 1289/1991, of 2 August 1991. The subcontracting must not entail any 
amendment to the Deed of Establishment of the Fund or an increase in the price the 
Fund, through the Gestora, must pay to the Administrator for providing the Services. The 
subcontracting envisaged here must be notified to the Rating Agencies. 
 
 
139 


 
4. 
Custody of documents 
The Administrator will act as custodian of the deeds in which the Mortgage Loans were 
formally contracted and all such other documents as may be of relevance, including, 
without limitation, insurance policies and computer records. 
The Administrator waives the privileges which the law confers upon it in its capacity as 
collections manager for the Fund and custodian of the Mortgage Transfer Certificates 
and, in particular, those provided in articles 1730 and 1780 of the Civil Code (retention as 
pledge of the deposited item) and 276 of the Code of Commerce (similar security to 
retention as pledge of the deposited item). 
The Gestora, on behalf of and for the account of the Fund, may examine and the 
Administrator must provide the original of the deeds in which the Mortgage Loans were 
contracted, as well as the rest of the relevant documents referred to above, that are 
deposited with the Administrator, whenever it deems fit, and may request that a copy of 
any of those documents be delivered to it free of charge within no more than forty-eight 
(48) hours. The Administrator must proceed in the same way in case of requests for 
information by the auditors of the Fund.  
5. 
Collections management 
The Administrator, as collections manager, will receive for the account of the Gestora, on 
behalf of and for the account of the Fund, all amounts paid by the mortgage obligors 
under the Mortgage Loans in respect of principal, interest and or any other item, 
including the insurance contracts assigned to the Gestora, on behalf of and for the 
account of the Fund, owed by virtue of the Mortgage Loans and will deposit the amounts 
to which the Fund is entitled, for value that same day, in the Treasury Account. 
The Administrator will likewise pay into that account and subject to that same time limit, 
such amounts as may be received from the mortgage obligors by way of prepayment of 
the Mortgage Loans to which the Fund is entitled. Conversely, the Administrator will not 
pay the fees it receives, where such is the case, from the mortgage obligors for the 
prepayment of the Mortgage Loans, as they belong to Barclays Bank, S.A.. 
In this regard, in accordance with article 1527 of the Civil Code, it is noted that an 
obligor who makes payments to the original creditor (that is, the Issuer) before learning 
of the assignment will be discharged from the obligation. 
 
 
140 


 
6. 
Fixing the interest rate 
The Administrator will calculate the floating interest rate of the Mortgage Loans 
according to the terms of the loan agreements and notify the mortgage obligors, within 
the time limits stipulated in those agreements, of the nominal interest rate applicable 
during the following period. 
The Administrator will provide information on the interest rate thus determined to the 
obligors who so request and to the Gestora. 
7. 
Advance of funds; insurance against damage to the mortgaged homes 
The Administrator will never make an advance of any amount which has not been 
previously received from the mortgage obligors in respect of principal, interest, 
prepayment or other items arising from the Mortgage Loans. 
The Administrator shall neither take nor fail to adopt any measure such as will result in 
the cancellation of any insurance policy against damage to the mortgaged homes or in 
the reduction of the amount payable on any claim under those policies. The 
Administrator must act with due diligence and, in all events, will exercise the rights 
granted by such insurance policies or by the deeds in which Mortgage Loan were granted 
in order to maintain in force and with full effect each insurance for damage policy (or any 
other policy which provides equivalent cover) in relation to the properties mortgaged as 
collateral for the Mortgage Loans. 
The Administrator, unless otherwise indicated by the Gestora, will be obliged to advance 
the payment of the policy premiums that have not been paid by the mortgage obligors, 
whenever it is aware of such non-payment, without prejudice to its right to be 
reimbursed for those advances by the Fund. 
The Administrator, in the event of a loss, must coordinate the actions for collecting the 
indemnities under the insurance policies against damage to the homes in accordance 
with the terms and conditions of the deeds in which the Mortgage Loans were granted 
and of the policies themselves, and pay such amounts as are collected to the Fund. 
8. 
Prohibited operations; events of increase of mortgage 
The Administrator will not voluntarily cancel the mortgages associated with the PHs, 
waive or transact on them, waive the Mortgage Loans, in full or in part, renew them or, 
in general, carry out any other act that diminishes the ranking, legal effect or economic 
 
 
141 


 
value of the mortgage or of the Mortgage Loans, without prejudice to attending to the 
requests of the mortgage obligors with the same diligence and procedures as for its non-
participation loans for reasons other than the repayment of the Mortgage Loan. 
Nevertheless, in certain exceptional circumstances the Gestora may, to avoid the costs 
and uncertainties entailed by all mortgage foreclosure processes and to maintain the 
Fund’s financial equilibrium, and in all events safeguarding the interests of the 
Bondholders, in its capacity as manager of third-party businesses, give the Administrator 
instructions or prior authorisation for it to agree with the obligor, on the terms they deem 
fit, and likewise in compliance with Law 2/1994 on the subrogation and amendment of 
mortgage loans, an amending novation of the Mortgage Loans. In particular, upon prior 
authorisation from the Gestora (only to be denied for reasonable causes), Barclays Bank, 
S.A. may agree to novations of the Mortgage Loans that shorten or lengthen the residual 
term of the Mortgage Loan in question (whether by shortening or lengthening the 
amortisation calendar or by modifying the repayment method), in all events subject to 
the limits and conditions provided in the applicable legislation and this Prospectus and, in 
particular, to the maximum time limit for maturity of the Mortgage Loans 30 June 2035, 
which will in no case be exceeded by the said novations. 
The Administrator will in no event (not even at the initiative of the Gestora) enter into 
renegotiations of the interest rate that could lead to a decrease in the interest rate 
applicable to a Mortgage Loan. 
The Administrator will be authorised to allow subrogations of the position of the 
mortgage obligor in the Mortgage Loan contracts, only where the characteristics of the 
new mortgage obligor are similar to those of the previous one and comply with the 
mortgage lending policy described in an Annex to the Deed of Establishment, and 
provided that the whole of the expenses arising from such modification will be for the 
account of the mortgage obligors. The Gestora may limit all or part of this authority of 
the Administrator or establish conditions for its use. 
Any other renegotiation subscribed by the Administrator will only take place with the 
prior written consent of the Gestora, and the Administrator agrees to request such 
consent from the Gestora as soon as it learns that a mortgage obligor has requested a 
renegotiation.  
The Gestora, on behalf of and for the account of the Fund, may at any time during the 
term of the Administration Agreement, upon reasonable advance notice to Barclays Bank, 
S.A. and for justified causes relating to the maintenance of the Fund’s financial 
 
 
142 


 
equilibrium, cancel, suspend or modify such requirements for the Administrator’s 
renegotiation powers as may have been granted.  
In the event there takes place any renegotiation of one or more Mortgage Loan, the 
Administrator will immediately communicate to the Gestora the conditions resulting from 
each renegotiation. The communication will be done through the electronic file provided 
for updating the conditions of the Mortgage Loans. Both the public deed and the private 
contracts for the novation of the Mortgage Loan conditions will remain in the custody of 
the Administrator according to the terms of this section. 
In the event of any renegotiation consented to by the Gestora, on behalf of and for the 
account of the Fund, of the Mortgage Loans, of their maturity dates, or of any other 
condition, the amendment of the conditions will affect the Fund. 
If the Administrator has actual knowledge that the value of the mortgaged property 
serving as collateral for a Mortgage Loan has declined by more than the legally permitted 
percentages, it will give immediate notice thereof to the Gestora and, at the request of 
the latter, must, in accordance with articles 26 and 29 of Royal Decree 685/1982, request 
the borrower to extend the mortgage accordingly to other assets sufficient to cover the 
required loan-to-value ratio. 
If the mortgage obligor, after being instructed of the need for such extension, declines, it 
shall be obliged to return the whole of the Mortgage Loan or the part in excess of the 
amount equal to 80% of the updated appraisal or such lower percentage as may be 
specified in the deed of grant of the Mortgage Loan, and the Administrator will be obliged 
to transfer the amounts received from the obligor as a result thereof to the Gestora, on 
behalf of and for the account of the Fund, to the Treasury Account held by the Gestora in 
the name of the Fund and described in section 3.4.4.1 of the Additional Building Block. 
If two (2) months after being instructed to do so the mortgage obligor has neither 
increased the mortgage nor returned the requisite part of the Mortgage Loan, the obligor 
shall be deemed to have chosen to return the whole of the Mortgage Loan, which will be 
immediately demanded by the Administrator. Once the amount of the whole of the 
Mortgage Loan has been received, the Administrator will immediately transfer to the 
Gestora, on behalf of and for the account of the Fund, the appropriate part according to 
the above. 
The mortgage obligor may make a request to the Administrator of the Mortgage Loans 
for the subrogation of a new creditor in accordance with the provisions of Law 2/1994 on 
 
 
143 


 
subrogation and amendment of mortgage loans. Subrogation of a new creditor to the 
Mortgage Loan and the consequent payment of the amount owed will produce the 
accelerated maturity of the Mortgage Loan and of the related PH. 
In no event will novations of the Mortgage Loans result in a modification of the calendar 
of the instalments payable in respect of the Mortgage Loan principal. 
9. 
Powers of the holder of the PHs in the event of default on the obligations 
of the mortgage obligor 
Enforcement against the mortgage obligors 
The Administrator shall apply the same diligence and procedures to claiming amounts 
fallen due and unpaid on the Mortgage Loans as it would to the other Mortgage Loans in 
its portfolio and, in particular, will pursue the relevant enforcement actions if the internal 
procedures for obtaining payment satisfactory to the interests of the Fund have been 
completed but have not achieved the desired results, or if the Gestora, after analysing 
the specific circumstances, deems, in agreement with the Administrator, such 
enforcement appropriate. 
In the event of non-payment by a mortgage obligor, the Fund, through its Gestora, will 
have the following powers according to the provisions of article 66 of Royal Decree 
685/1982, of 17 March 1982, as amended by Royal Decree 1289/91, of 2 August 1991: 
(a) 
compel the Administrator to commence foreclosure of the mortgage; 
(b) 
participate with the same rights as the Administrator in the foreclosure the latter 
pursues against the obligor, appearing for this purpose in any foreclosure 
proceedings commenced by the Administrator and sharing in the proceeds of the 
auction pro rata to its percentage participation in the enforced credit; 
(c) 
if the Administrator does not commence the proceedings within sixty (60) calendar 
days from the notarial notice demanding payment of the debt, the Gestora, on 
behalf of and for the account of the Fund, will have subsidiary standing to initiate 
foreclosure proceedings of the Mortgage Loan in the amount corresponding to its 
percentage participation, for both principal and interest; and 
(d) 
if the proceedings pursued by the Administrator are halted, the Fund, represented 
by the Gestora, may be subrogated to the position of the Administrator and 
 
 
144 


 
continue the foreclosure proceedings without the need to wait for the stipulated 
time limit to expire. 
In the events provided in subparagraphs (c) and (d), the Gestora, on behalf of and for 
the account of the Fund, may apply to the competent Judge to initiate or continue the 
relevant foreclosure proceedings, submitting with the application the original certificate 
of the PH, including the notary demand stipulated in section (c) above and the registry 
certificate of registration and survival of the mortgage. 
If legally required, for purposes of articles 581.2 and 686.2 of the Spanish Civil 
Procedure Law (Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil; hereinafter the LEC), the Administrator, in 
the Deed of Establishment itself, will grant an irrevocable power of attorney to the 
Gestora, as ample and sufficient as legally required, so that the Gestora can, acting for 
and on behalf of the Administrator, serve a notary demand on the mortgage obligor of 
any of the Mortgage Loans for payment of the obligor’s debt. 
The Fund, as owner of the PH, may likewise participate, through the Gestora, with 
equal rights to the Administrator in the enforcement proceedings and may, on the 
terms set out in article 691 et seq. of the LEC, request to be awarded the mortgaged 
property in payment of its credit. The Gestora will sell the properties thus awarded as 
soon as possible in market conditions. 
In addition, the Administrator undertakes to report to the Gestora on all non-payments, 
prepayments and changes of interest rates and of demands for payment, court actions 
and any other circumstances having a material effect on the Mortgage Loans. The 
Administrator will likewise provide the Gestora with all documentation the latter may 
request in relation to those Mortgage Loans and, in particular, the documentation 
required for the initiation of any necessary legal action by the Gestora. 
Enforcement action against Barclays Bank, S.A. 
The Gestora, on behalf of and for the account of the Fund, will have a right of action 
against Barclays Bank, S.A. to enforce the maturities of the PHs for principal and 
interest when the default on the obligation to pay the said items is not the result of 
non-payment by the obligors under the Mortgage Loans. 
Once the Mortgage Loans have been extinguished, the Fund, through the Gestora, will 
maintain its rights of action against Barclays Bank, S.A. until all of its obligations have 
been fulfilled. 
 
 
145 


 
10. Liability assumed by Barclays Bank, S.A. to the holder of the PHs 
In accordance with Law 19/1992, the risk of non-payment of the PHs will be borne by 
the Bondholders. Therefore, the Administrator, in its capacity as issuer of the PHs, 
assumes no liability whatsoever for non-payment by the mortgage obligors, whether of 
principal, interest or any other sum they may owe under the Mortgage Loans related to 
the PHs. 
3.7.2.2 
Liability of the Administrator and Indemnification 
The Administrator will undertake to perform the custody and administration of the 
Mortgage Loans with all due diligence and will be liable to the Fund, through the Gestora, 
for any damage which may arise out of its negligence. 
Indemnification by the Administrator 
The Administrator will indemnify the Fund for any damage, loss or expense which the 
Fund may incur due to the breach by the Administrator of its custody, administration and 
reporting obligations in relation to the Mortgage Loans. 
The Administrator assumes no responsibility for guaranteeing directly or indirectly the 
successful outcome of the operation; nor will it grant any guarantees or sureties or enter 
into any agreements for the repurchase of the PHs, except for those that at the Date of 
Establishment do not comply with the representations and warranties contained in 
section 2.2.8 of the Additional Building Block.  
3.7.2.3 
Remuneration of the Administrator 
As consideration for the administration and custody of the Mortgage Loans, Barclays 
Bank, S.A. (or such entity as may replace it in the administration function, if appropriate 
according to the terms of the Prospectus) will be entitled to receive on each Payment 
Date and during the term of the Administration Agreement, a subordinate administration 
fee of 0.01% per annum, which will accrue daily and be paid quarterly on the 
Determination Date for the previous Payment Date over the amount of PHs outstanding 
at that Payment Date, VAT included. By way of exception, the administration fee will not 
be assessed on the first Payment Date, which will be paid for the first time on 15 June 
2006 or the next following Business Day. 
The amount of the administration fee to be paid on a given Payment Date will be 
determined by applying the following formula: 
 
 
146 


 
C = B x 0.01% x d/365 
where: 
C = Administration fee payable on a given Payment Date. 
B = Amounts of the PHs outstanding at that Payment Date. 
d = Number of days in the accrual period of reference (except for the first accrual period, 
for which there will be considered the days from the Date of Establishment to the first 
Payment Date). 
It is expressly note that the administration fee will be understood to include any ordinary 
expenses incurred in connection with the collections management (including, by way of 
example and without limitation, telephone and postal expenses).  
If Barclays Bank, S.A. is replaced in the performance of the administration and custody 
duties, if possible and appropriate to the accompanying circumstances which could 
impede or hinder the proper performance of the administration, the Gestora will have 
authority to agree a different percentage (even if higher than 0.01% per annum) for the 
commission payable to the substitute, provided it is not a Barclays Group company. Such 
fee will accrue and be paid quarterly on each Payment Date over the amount of PHs 
outstanding at that Payment Date, VAT included. 
If Barclays Bank, S.A. is substituted as Administrator of the Mortgage Loans at any time 
during the life of the Fund, the new amount payable to the new administrator of the 
Mortgage Loans in respect of administration fee will be ranked third (3rd) in the Order of 
Priority of Payments stipulated in section 3.4.6 of the Additional Building Block (and third 
(3rd) in the Fund Liquidation Order of Priority of Payments stipulated in section 3.4.6 of 
the Additional Building Block), ahead of the payment of the amounts due on settlement 
of the Interest Rate Swap Agreement, provided the new administrator does not belong to 
the Barclays Group. 
Barclays Bank, S.A. will likewise be entitled, as remuneration or compensation for the 
financial intermediation carried on, to receive a variable and subordinated amount to be 
determined and paid quarterly on each Payment Date. This sum will accrue quarterly and 
be equal to the positive difference, if any, between the revenues and expenses accrued 
quarterly according to the Fund’s accounting, so as to give the quarterly financial margin 
obtained (the “Financial Intermediation Margin”). The Financial Intermediation 
Margin for each Payment Date will only be paid to the extent that there exists, on that 
 
 
147 


 
Payment Date, sufficient liquidity according to the Order of Priority of Payments 
stipulated in section 3.4.6 and to the Fund Liquidation Order of Priority of Payments 
stipulated in section 3.4.6 of the Additional Building Block. Otherwise, Barclays Bank, S.A. 
will forfeit all right to the said Financial Intermediation Margin. 
This sum will not be considered a fee or consideration owed for the delivery of goods or 
provision of a service to the Fund, but will instead be considered remuneration for the 
financial intermediation performed by Barclays Bank, S.A. by means of issuing the PHs 
pooled in the Fund.  
If the Fund, through the Gestora, does not pay on a Payment Date the whole of the 
administration fee owed, due to lack of sufficient liquidity according to the Order of 
Priority of Payments stipulated in section 3.4.6 of the Additional Building Block, the 
amounts not paid will be accumulated without any penalty whatsoever with the fee 
payable on the next Payment Date, and be paid at that time, unless the lack of liquidity 
continues, in which case the payment owed will be postponed until the Payment Date on 
which there is sufficient liquidity. 
Also, on each Payment Date, Barclays Bank, S.A. will be entitled to be reimbursed for all 
exceptional expenses it may have incurred, such as those occasioned as a result of 
foreclosures, sale of properties, payment of premiums of insurance policies against 
damage to the mortgaged homes that have not been paid by the mortgage obligors, etc., 
upon due justification of their relation to the administration of the Mortgage Loans. 
Those expenses will be reimbursed provided the Fund has sufficient liquidity in 
accordance with what is provided in section 3.4.6. of the Additional Building Block.
