the market liquidity of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes and the Class C Notes of any Note

PCS LABEL 
An application may be made to Prime Collateralised Securities (PCS) UK Limited (the PCS) for the 
Class A Notes of any Notes Series to receive the Prime Collateralised Securities label (the PCS 
Label). A reference to the application (or not) for the PCS Label for the Class A Notes of any Note 
Series will be included in the corresponding Issuing Document. However, there can be no assurance 
that the Class A Notes of any Notes Series will granted the PCS Label (either before issuance or at 
any time thereafter) and should the Class A Notes of any Notes Series be granted the PCS Label, there 
can be no assurance that the PCS Label will not be withdrawn at a later date.  
The PCS Label is awarded to the most senior tranche of asset backed transactions that fully meet the 
criteria that are set down by PCS. The relevant criteria seek to capture some of the aspects of asset 
backed securities that are indicative of simplicity, asset liquidity and transparency and reflect some of 
the best practices available in Europe. 
The PCS Label is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. It is not investment advice 
whether generally or as defined under Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (2004/39/EC) and it 
is not a credit rating whether generally or as defined under the Credit Rating Agency Regulation 
(1060/2009/EC) or Section 3(a) of the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (as amended by 
the Credit Agency Reform Act of 2006). PCS is not an “expert” as defined in the United States 
Securities Acts of 1933 (as amended). 
By awarding the PCS Label to certain securities, no views are expressed about the creditworthiness of 
these securities or their suitability for any existing or potential investor or as to whether there will be a 
ready, liquid market for these securities.  
Investors should conduct their own research regarding the nature of the PCS Label and must read the 
information set out in http://pcsmarket.org. The website http://pcsmarket.org shall not form part of 
this Base Prospectus.

RISK FACTORS 
1. 
RISKS DERIVED FROM THE ASSETS BACKING THE ISSUE 
1.1. 
Risk of non-payment by the Borrowers 
Neither Servicios Financieros Carrefour, E.F.C., S.A. (SFC) as seller of the Receivables to 
the Fund (the Seller), nor the Arrangers and Joint Lead Managers or any global coordinator, 
lead manager, bookrunner or underwriter assumes any liability for non-payment by the 
individuals who have entered into such Credit Card Agreements as principal obligors to the 
Seller (the Borrowers and each of them a Borrower), whether for principal, interest or any 
other amount owed by virtue of the Receivables. The Receivables do not benefit from any 
personal guarantee or security.  
Each holder of a securitisation note (the Notes) issued by the Fund (a Noteholder) will bear 
the risk of non-payment by the Borrowers always taking into account the protection 
mechanisms described in section 3.4.3 of the Additional Building Block. 
Transfer of title to the Receivables will be complete and unconditional throughout the 
remaining repayment period until maturity of each Receivable. Pursuant to article 1,529 of the 
Civil Code and article 348 of the Commercial Code, the Seller will only be held liable 
vis-à-vis the Fund for the existence and legitimacy of the Receivables, in the terms 
and conditions declared in this Base Prospectus and the public deed of incorporation of the 
Fund (the Deed of Incorporation) that are set forth in this Base Prospectus, as well as for 
the legal status with which it carries out the sale.  
Likewise, the Seller will not grant collateral or bank guarantees, whether pursuant to the Deed 
of Incorporation, or to this Base Prospectus, or to any other agreement or contract to secure 
the payments under the Receivables by the Borrowers (subject to the in rem rights of pledge 
granted over the accounts opened by SFC in its capacity as servicer of the Purchased 
Receivables (the Servicer) with the Collections Accounts Banks for the purposes set out in 
section 3.4.3.9 of the Additional Building Block (the Collections Accounts) to reduce the 
commingling risk as described in section 3.4.3.9 of the Additional Building Block (see risk 
factor 3.4 in this regard)). For these purposes, Collections Accounts Banks means each of 
the Spanish financial institutions where the Collections Accounts held by the Servicer are 
opened from time to time (as of the date of this Base Prospectus, Banco Santander, S.A. and 
Bankia, S.A.). 
All of this, without prejudice to (i) the Seller's obligation to repurchase the Purchased 
Receivables that do not comply with the applicable sale representations or, alternatively, 
indemnify the Fund where such repurchase is not possible, subject to and in accordance with 
the provisions set forth in section 2.2.9 of the Additional Building Block, (ii) the General 
Reserve and (iii) the Commingling Reserve described in sections 3.4.3.7 and 3.4.3.8 of the 
Additional Building Block, respectively. 


 
13 
The Notes of any series (each a Note Series) do not represent or constitute an obligation of 
the Seller, the Arrangers, any global coordinator, lead manager (including the Joint Lead 
Managers), bookrunner or underwriter, the Eligible Hedging Counterparties or of the 
Management Company.  
No guarantees have been granted by any public or private entities, including the Seller, 
the Management Company, the Arrangers, any global coordinator, lead manager (including 
the Joint Lead Managers), bookrunner or underwriter, the Eligible Hedging Counterparties, 
the Paying Agent, the Issuer Accounts Bank or any other firm affiliated with or invested by 
any of the above. 
1.2. 
The Seller may change the terms and conditions of the Credit Card Agreements, the 
Receivables and its Credit and Servicing Policies  
Although the legal title of the Receivables will be transferred by the Seller to the Fund, the 
Seller will continue to manage the Client Accounts under which the Receivables come into 
existence and will remain the contractual counterparty of the Borrowers under the Credit Card 
Agreements. As such, the Seller retains the right to change various terms and conditions of 
the Client Accounts (as governed by the related Credit Card Agreement), including the 
interest amounts and other fees it charges and the required minimum monthly payment in 
accordance with its usual business practices.  
The Seller may change the terms of the Credit Card Agreements (and thus the Client 
Accounts) to, for example, maintain its competitive position in the revolving consumer credit 
market in Spain. The Seller may change the terms of the Client Accounts in a manner which 
may reduce the amount of Receivables arising under the Client Accounts, may reduce the 
amount of the Available Collections on those Receivables or otherwise may adversely alter 
payment patterns. Additionally, as described in section 1.3 below, the Seller may change the 
rate of periodic interest amounts. 
Additionally, the Seller shall be entitled to amend the Credit Card Agreements or the Standard 
Forms if such amendment (A) is the mandatory result of a final court resolution, (B) is 
imposed by any competent administrative or regulatory authority, (C) affects the interest rate 
or the fees, the instalment due date, the instalment amount, the maximum authorised credit 
amount and/or implies the application of grace periods for payment of interest, to the extent 
permitted by the terms of such Credit Card Agreement, the usual Credit Policies and the 
Servicing Policies or (D) is required by applicable laws or regulations. 
Certain mechanism have been introduced in the documentation to minimise the impact of 
such amendments to the Credit Card Agreement and the Standard Forms. 
Additionally, the Servicer shall be entitled to agree amendments or write-offs in relation to 
the Purchased Receivables in the context and within the limits set out in its servicing and 
management policies (the Servicing Policies), which could also imply a reduction the amount 
of the Available Collections on those Purchased Receivables or otherwise adversely alter 
payment patterns. 


 
14 
In order to mitigate this risk, any such amendments are subject to certain limits and in some 
instances, to the payment of Seller Dilutions by the Seller to the Fund, as set out in sections 
3.3.1.10 and 3.7.2.12 of the Additional Building Block.  
In addition, the Seller may change its credit policies (the Credit Policies) and Servicing 
Policies, procedures and practices relating to the operation of its general credit business if 
such change is made applicable to the comparable segment of revolving credit accounts 
owned and serviced by the Seller.   
1.3. 
The Seller may change the interest payable under the Receivables 
The interest rate payable under the Receivables is contractually agreed between the Seller and 
the Borrower. In accordance with the information provided in section 2.2.2 of the Additional 
Building Block, the interest rate of the Audited Portfolio is 20.04%. For these purposes, 
Audited Portfolio means the aggregate of the Receivables audited by MAZARS Auditores, 
S.L.P. (Mazars or the Auditor) from which the Receivables to be transferred to the Fund on 
the Fund Incorporation Date (or, as applicable, on any other Purchase Date during the life of 
the Fund) will be selected. 
The Seller may modify the terms and conditions of the Credit Card Agreements (including the 
interest rate applicable under the Receivables from time to time) after individually notifying 
the Borrower at least two (2) months in advance to the proposed date of implementation of 
the amendments.  
In case that the Seller modifies the terms and conditions of the Credit Card Agreements 
reducing the interest rate applicable under the Receivables there would be a reduction of the 
amounts received by the Fund and consequently its capacity to honour its payments 
obligations under the Notes. 
Consequently, there can be no guarantee that the yield received following such a rate change 
will remain at the same level relative to the rate of interest payable by the Fund on the Notes. 
1.4. 
Interest Rate risk  
The Receivables to be purchased by the Fund bear an adjustable fixed interest rate while the 
Class A Notes and/or the Class B Notes and/or the Class C Notes of any Note Series may bear 
a floating rate of interest as specified in the relevant the Issuing Document. 
Consequently, the Fund may be exposed to an interest rate risk which may be hedged 
contractually (through the setting of a Maximum Interest Rate to the relevant Notes) or with 
any Class A Hedging Agreement on the issue of any Class A Floating Rate Notes, any Class 
B Hedging Agreement on the issue of any Class B Floating Rate Notes and any Class C 
Hedging Agreement on the issue of any Class C Floating Rate Notes entered into between the 
Fund, represented by the Management Company, and any Eligible Hedging Counterparties. 
Where interest rate risk is hedged with any Hedging Agreement, during periods in which 
floating rate payments payable by any Eligible Hedging Counterparty under any Hedging 


 
15 
Agreement are greater than the fixed rate payments payable by the Fund under the same 
Hedging Agreement, the Fund will be more dependent on receiving net payments from the 
Eligible Hedging Counterparty in order to make interest payments on the Notes of any Note 
Series bearing a floating interest rate.  
If in such a period the Eligible Hedging Counterparty fails to pay any amounts when due 
under the Hedging Agreement, the Available Distribution Amount may not be sufficient to 
make all required payments on the Notes of any Note Series and the holders of such Notes 
may experience delays and/or reductions in the interest and principal payments on their 
Notes.  
During periods in which floating rate payments payable by any Eligible Hedging 
Counterparty under any Hedging Agreement are less than the fixed rate payments payable by 
the Fund under the same Hedging Agreement, the Fund will be obliged under the Hedging 
Agreement to make a net payment to the Eligible Hedging Counterparty.  
The Eligible Hedging Counterparty’s claims for payment (including certain termination 
payments required to be made by the Fund upon a termination of the Hedging Agreement) 
under the Hedging Agreement will rank higher in priority than all payments on the Class A 
Notes, the Class B Notes and the Class C Notes.  
If a net payment under any of the Hedging Agreement is due to any Eligible Hedging 
Counterparty on a Payment Date, the then Available Distribution Amount may be insufficient 
to make such net payment to the Eligible Hedging Counterparty and, in turn, interest and 
principal payments to the holders of Notes of any Note Series, so that the Noteholders may 
experience delays and/or reductions in the interest and principal payments on their Notes.  
The Fund is exposed to the risk that any Eligible Hedging Counterparty may become 
insolvent. In the event that any Eligible Hedging Counterparty suffers a rating downgrade 
below the required ratings, the Fund may terminate the relevant Hedging Agreement if the 
Eligible Hedging Counterparty fails, within a set period of time, to take certain actions 
intended to mitigate the effects of such downgrade. Such actions may include the Eligible 
Hedging Counterparty collateralising its obligations under the Hedging Agreement, 
transferring its obligations to a replacement interest rate swap counterparty having the 
required ratings or procuring that an entity with the required ratings becomes a co obligor 
with or guarantor of the Eligible Hedging Counterparty as further described in section 3.4.8.1 
of the Additional Building Block.  
However in the event any Eligible Hedging Counterparty is downgraded below the required 
ratings there can be no assurance that a co-obligor, guarantor or replacement interest rate 
swap counterparty will be found or that the amount of collateral provided will be sufficient to 
meet the Eligible Hedging Counterparty’s obligations.  
Additional description of the termination of any Hedging Agreement is included in section 
3.4.8.1 of the Additional Building Block. 


 
16 
1.5. 
Credit Consumer protection laws  
There is an increasing tendency in recent years for Spanish borrowers (mostly individuals 
who qualify as consumers) to file claims against financial institutions alleging that certain 
provisions included in the agreements signed by them are unfair (abusivas) and therefore null 
and void. 
Whilst the Seller has represented that the Credit Card Agreements are legal, valid and 
binding, it is worth noting that this is an evolving matter of law as the Spanish Courts analyse 
the unfairness of contractual clauses on a case by case basis and, therefore, there is a risk that 
a court might declare a clause as unfair despite the fact that no previous challenges existed 
regarding such clause (provided that the Seller must repurchase any Receivable arising from a 
Credit Card Agreement failing to comply with such representation). 
In addition, the Spanish Tribunal Supremo (the Spanish Supreme Court) has recently ruled 
(Judgment 628/2015 of 25 November (the Judgement) that an ordinary interest rate of 24.6% 
TAE (the Spanish “APR” equivalent) in a fixed rate consumer revolving facility granted in 
2001 is “usurious”, i.e., “materially higher than the normal interest rate of money”. 
The Judgment provided that contractual interest rates which are twice the “normal interest 
rates” are “usurious”. When determining what is the “normal interest rate” of money, the 
Judgment resorted to the interest rate statistics published by the Bank of Spain, in accordance 
with Regulation (EU) No 1072/2013 of the European Central Bank of 24 September 2013 and 
Bank of Spain Circular 1/2010 of 27 January). 
The relevant statistics for 2016 show that the average TEDR interest rate (equivalent to TAE 
but without including fees) of credit cards for 2016 was 21.03% (the average for January 
2017 being 20.93%), whilst the interest rate of the Credit Cards Agreement of the Seller as of 
the date of this Base Prospectus is set at 20.04% (TAE 21.99%). Therefore, they should not 
be considered “usurious” in accordance with the test set out in the abovementioned Judgment 
628/2015. 
Broadly speaking, the consequence of a facility being “usurious” is that the facility is null and 
void so that the borrower must only repay the creditor an amount equal to that borrowed from 
it and it is entitled to request the creditor to pay back any amounts paid in the past by it in 
excess of such amount. 
Furthermore, there is a risk that case law evolves in the future and Spanish courts consider the 
interest charged to the Borrowers under these Credit Card Agreements usurious and 
consequently the Credit Card Agreements null and void. This may imply that claims are 
raised against the Fund in respect of amounts received in connection with such Credit Card 
Agreements which could potentially adversely affect the capacity of the Fund to honour its 
payment obligations under the Notes.  


 
17 
1.6. 
Searches, Investigations and Warranties in Relation to the Receivables  
The Seller will give certain warranties to the Fund regarding the Receivables sold to the Fund. 
See section 2.2.8 of the Additional Building Block in this regard. 
Neither the Management Company, the Fund, the Arrangers, the Global Coordinators, the 
Joint Lead Managers nor any Eligible Hedging Counterparties have undertaken, or will 
undertake, any investigations, searches or other actions of any nature whatsoever in respect of 
any Receivables in the Audited Portfolio or to establish the creditworthiness of any Borrowers 
and each relies instead on the warranties given by the Seller which are disclosed in section 
2.2.8 of the Additional Building Block.  
As such, the Receivables may be subject to matters which would have been revealed by a full 
investigation or, if incapable of remedy had such matters been revealed. The primary remedy 
of the Fund against the Seller if any of the warranties made by the Seller is materially 
breached or proves to be materially untrue as at the Purchase Date which breach is not 
remedied will be to require the Seller to repurchase any relevant Receivable in accordance 
with the repurchase provisions in the Master Receivables Sale and Purchase Agreement, as 
set forth in Section 2.2.9 of the Additional Building Block. The Seller is liable for any 
repurchase. However, there can be no assurance that the Seller will have the financial 
resources to honour such obligations.  
Furthermore, the Seller has undertaken to notify the Fund upon becoming aware of a material 
breach of any representation and warranty in relation to the Receivables. The Seller is not 
obliged to monitor compliance of the Receivables with the representations and warranties 
following the relevant Purchase Date.  
1.7. 
Limited protection 
An investment in the Notes of any Notes Series may be affected, inter alia, by a deterioration 
of the general economic conditions that have a negative effect on the payments of the 
Receivables that back the issue of the Notes of any Notes Series by the Fund. In the event that 
non-payments reach an elevated level, they could reduce, or even eliminate, the protection 
against losses in the Receivables portfolio which the Notes of any Notes Series benefit from 
as a result of the credit enhancements described under section 3.4.3 of the Additional 
Building Block. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing considerations, the risk of the Noteholders is mitigated by the 
different Priorities of Payments described in section 3.4.7.2 of the Additional Building Block. 
1.8. 
Purchase of Receivables 
There is no assurance that in the future the origination or the current level of origination of 
new Receivables satisfying the Eligibility Criteria set out in section 2.2.8.2 of the Additional 
Building Block (the Eligible Receivables) (transferred by the Seller to the Fund in the 
context of Initial Transfers) or new Receivables deriving from additional Drawings 
(transferred in the context of Additional Transfers) will be maintained and that, consequently, 


 
18 
during the Programme Revolving Period (only), the Fund’s securitised portfolio will be 
replenished at its required level to prevent the occurrence of a Revolving Termination Event 
(as defined in section 3.1.3 of the Additional Building Block) which will early terminate the 
Programme Revolving Period and will start the Programme Amortisation Period. Once the 
Programme Amortisation Period has started, the Seller shall transfer Eligible Receivables in 
the context of Additional Transfers and may still be entitled to transfer Eligible Receivables 
in the context of Initial Transfers but with no guarantee to prevent a breach of the Minimum 
Portfolio Amount. 
It should be noted that the Fund shall not purchase from the Seller Eligible Receivables in the 
context of Initial Transfers and/or Additional Transfers if any of the Conditions Precedent to 
the Purchase of Receivables set out in section 3.3.1.2 of the Additional Building Block are not 
satisfied.  
1.9. 
Changes in the Portfolio 
The characteristics of the portfolio of outstanding Purchased Receivables will change from 
time to time with (i) the additional purchases of Receivables in the context of Initial Transfers 
and/or Additional Transfers by the Fund during the Programme Revolving Period, the 
Programme Amortisation Period and the Programme Accelerated Amortisation Period and (ii) 
the repayment or prepayment, as the case may be, of the Receivables. 
The Eligibility Criteria described in section 2.2.8.2 of the Additional Building Block aim at 
limiting the changes of the overall characteristics the Purchased Receivables. 
1.10. 
No assurance of insurance protection 
The Aggregate Outstanding Debt of the insured Credit Cards was EUR 360,541,001.53 as of 
15 March 2017, representing 52.43% of the Aggregate Outstanding Debt. In all such Credit 
Card Agreements, the Seller was designated as beneficiary of the insurance payment and 
therefore, these payments (the Insurance Indemnification) would form part of the rights 
conferred upon the Fund, as established in section 3.3.3 of the Additional Building Block. 
However, there is no assurance and no commitment that in the future the Seller will remain 
the beneficiary of the Insurance Indemnifications in respect of those Credit Card Agreements 
or any future Credit Card Agreements. 
Moreover, as explained in section 3.7.2.13 of the Additional Building Block, the Seller does 
not enforce or actively seek payment by the insurance companies of the Insurance 
Indemnification irrespective of whether it is named as the beneficiary thereunder or not.   
1.11. 
Projections, Forecasts and Estimates. Forward-looking statements 
Certain matters contained in this Base Prospectus are forward-looking statements. Such 
statements appear in a number of places in this Base Prospectus, including with respect to 
assumptions on prepayment and certain other characteristics of the Receivables and reflect 
significant assumptions and subjective judgments by the Management Company that may or 


 
19 
may not prove to be correct. Consequently, future results may differ from the Fund's 
expectations due to a variety of factors, including (but not limited to) the economic 
environment and changes in governmental regulations, fiscal policy, planning or tax laws in 
Spain or elsewhere. Moreover, past financial performance should not be considered a reliable 
indicator of future performance and prospective purchasers of any Class A Note and/or any 
Class B Notes and/or any Class C Notes of any Note Series are cautioned that any such 
statements are not guarantees of performance and involve risks and uncertainties, many of 
which are beyond the control of the Management Company. Neither the Arrangers nor any 
global coordinator, lead manager (including the Joint Lead Managers), bookrunner or 
underwriter has attempted or will attempt to verify any such statements, and do not make any 
representation, express or implied, with respect thereto. 
More generally, when issued in this Base Prospectus, the words “expect(s)”, “intend(s)”, 
“will” “may”, “anticipate(s)” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking 
statements. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which could cause 
actual results to differ materially from those projected. 
In addition, any projections, forecasts and estimates contained herein are forward-looking 
statements and are necessarily speculative in nature. It can be expected that some or all of the 
assumptions underlying such projections will not materialise or will vary significantly from 
actual results. The historical performance of similar obligations is not necessarily indicative 
of its future performance. 
The financial and other information set out in this Base Prospectus, represents the historical 
experience of the Seller. None of the Arrangers, any global coordinator, lead manager 
(including the Joint Lead Managers), bookrunner or underwriter, the Management Company, 
the Paying Agent, the Issuer Accounts Bank or any of the Eligible Hedging Counterparties 
has undertaken or will undertake any investigation or review of, or search to verify the 
historical information. 
There is no assurance that the future experience and performance of the Purchased 
Receivables, the Fund or the Servicer will be similar to the historical experience described in 
this Base Prospectus. 
2. 
RISKS DERIVED FROM THE NOTES 
2.1. 
Subordination of the Class B Notes and the Class C Notes  
Credit enhancement for the Class A Notes of each Notes Series will be provided by the 
subordination of payments on the Class B Notes and the Class C Notes of the corresponding 
Notes Series during the Programme Revolving Period and the Programme Amortisation 
Period, and, by the subordination of payments on the Class B Notes and the Class C Notes of 
all Notes Series during the Programme Accelerated Amortisation Period. 
In addition, credit enhancement for the Class B Notes of each Notes Series will be provided 
by the subordination of payments on the Class C Notes of the corresponding Notes Series 
during the Programme Revolving Period and the Programme Amortisation Period, and, by the 


 
20 
subordination of payments on the Class C Notes of all Notes Series during the Programme 
Accelerated Amortisation Period 
Nevertheless there is no certainty that these subordination rules shall protect any class of 
Noteholders from the risk of loss. 
According to section 3.1.3 of the Additional Building Block, only the non-payment of the 
interest due and payable of the then most senior class of Notes between the Class A Notes and 
the Class B Notes shall be considered an Accelerated Amortisation Event. 
2.2. 
Relationship between Class A, Class B and Class C Notes and the Seller Interest Credit 
Facility  
During the Programme Revolving Period (i) the payments of interest under the Seller Interest 
Credit Facility will be paid on the same rank with the payments of interest under the then 
most senior Class of Notes of all outstanding Note Series (whether it be Class A Notes, Class 
B Notes or Class C Notes) and (ii) the payments of principal under the Seller Interest Credit 
Facility will be paid on the same rank with the payments of interest and principal under the 
then most senior Class of Notes of all outstanding Note Series (whether it be Class A Notes, 
Class B Notes or Class C Notes) (provided that the Residual Principal Deficiency Ledger is 
not in debit on the preceding Calculation Date). 
During the Programme Amortisation Period and the Programme Accelerated Amortisation 
Period (i) the payments of interest on the Seller Interest Credit Facility are subordinated to the 
payments of the Notes of any Note Series and (ii) the payments of principal under the Seller 
Interest Credit Facility will be subordinated to the full redemption of the Class A Notes, the 
Class B Notes and the Class C Notes of all Note Series. 
2.3. 
Default interest 
In the event that on a Monthly Payment Date the Available Distribution Amounts, after going 
through the Interest Shortfall Priority of Payments, are not sufficient to meet in full interest 
amount due under the Notes, the unpaid amount of interest will be postponed.  
The postponed interest will neither accrue default interest nor imply capitalisation of the debt.  
For these purposes, Monthly Payment Date means the day falling on the 26th in each month 
of each year (subject to the Modified Following Business Day Convention).  
Interest Shortfall Priority of Payments has the meaning set out in section 3.4.7.2 of the 
Additional Building Block. 
2.4. 
Yield to Maturity of the Notes of any Note Series and the weighted average life of the 
Notes of each Note Series 
The yields to maturity on the Note Series will be sensitive to and affected by the amount and 
timing of delinquencies, prepayment and payment pattern, revolving and credit card usage, 
dilution and default on the Purchased Receivables, the level of the relevant interest reference 


 
21 
rate with respect to the Notes, the occurrence of any Revolving Termination Events or any 
Accelerated Amortisation Events (as these terms are defined in section 3.1.3 of the Additional 
Building Block), the issuance of a new Note Series, the redemption of a Note Series, the 
occurrence of an Optional Early Redemption Event (as defined in section 4.9.5 of the 
Securities Note), the exercise by the Seller of the optional repurchase of Purchased 
Receivables and the early liquidation of the Fund. Each of such events may impact the 
respective weighted average lives and the yield to maturity of the Notes of any Note Series.  
The weighted average interest rate of the Client Accounts may decrease from time to time due 
to various economic, financial or commercial events. This risk is mitigated by the applicable 
Eligibility Criteria on each Purchase Date. 
The weighted average life of the Notes of any Note Series and the relevant assumptions shall 
be specified (i) with respect to the Notes of the Note Series to be issued on the Fund 
Incorporation Date, in the relevant Issuing Document and (ii) with respect to the Notes of any 
Note Series to be issued on any Issue Date (other than the Fund Incorporation Date), in the 
relevant Issuing Document. 
2.5. 
Rating of the Rated Notes 
The credit risk of the Notes of any Notes Series (the Rated Notes) may be assessed by the 
Rating Agencies specified in the applicable Issuing Document of each Note Series (the 
Relevant Rating Agencies) as referred to in section 7.5 of the Securities Note.  
The Class A Notes and the Class B Notes (if any) of any Note Series shall always be Rated 
Notes. It is not obligatory that the Class C Notes are Rated Notes. That said, if the Class C 
Notes of any Note Series are Rated Notes, the Class C Notes of such Note Series shall be 
rated at least by two of the Relevant Rating Agencies. 
The meaning of the ratings assigned to the Rated Notes can be consulted in the web pages of 
the Relevant Rating Agencies. 
The Relevant Rating Agencies may not confirm any of the preliminary ratings initially 
assigned to the Rated Notes (or even withdraw such preliminary ratings) before the 
disbursement of the Notes on the Disbursement Date. In such event, the issue of such Note 
Series will be terminated by the Management Company (as described in section 2.6 below). 
In addition, the Relevant Rating Agencies may revise, suspend or withdraw the final rating 
assigned to the Rated Notes in each class at any time, based on any information that may 
come to their attention and/or changes in rating methodologies and practices. 
Therefore, these ratings are not and cannot therefore be construed as an invitation, 
recommendation or encouragement for investors to proceed to carry out any transaction 
whatsoever on the Rated Notes and, in particular, acquire, keep, charge or sell those Rated 
Notes. 


 
22 
In general, European regulated investors are restricted under Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 
of the European Parliament and the Council of 16 September 2009 on credit rating agencies 
(Regulation 1060/2009) from using credit ratings for regulatory purposes, unless such ratings 
are issued by a credit rating agency established in the EU and registered under Regulation 
1060/2009 (and such registration has not been withdrawn or suspended). The list of registered 
and certified rating agencies published by the European Securities and Markets Authority 
(ESMA) on its website in accordance with Regulation 1060/2009 is not conclusive evidence 
of the status of the relevant rating agency included in such list, as there might be delays 
between certain supervisory measures being taken against a relevant rating agency and the 
publication of the updated ESMA list. Certain information with respect to the credit rating 
agencies and ratings is set out in this Base Prospectus. 
In addition to the abovementioned, there could be unsolicited ratings published in respect of 
the Rated Notes. If such unsolicited ratings are lower than the comparable rating assigned to 
the Rated Notes by the Relevant Rating Agencies, those unsolicited ratings could have an 
adverse effect on the value of the Rated Notes. 
2.6. 
Risk linked to the early termination of a Notes Series issue and the early liquidation of 
the Fund  
2.6.1. Early termination of a Notes Series issue 
An issue of a Notes Series will be terminated by the Management Company if: 
 
any of the preliminary ratings initially assigned to the Rated Notes by the Relevant 
(a)
Rating Agencies have not been confirmed (or if such ratings are withdrawn) before 
the disbursement of the Notes on the Disbursement Date; or  
 
an event occurs that could not be foreseen or, even if foreseen, is inevitable rendering 
(b)
it impossible to perform the subscription or disbursement of the Notes of such Notes 
Series pursuant to article 1,105 of the Civil Code (force majeure); or  
 
the conditions precedent to the relevant Notes Subscription Agreement are not met 
(c)
before the beginning of the Subscription Period; or  
 
the bookrunners and/or underwriters appointed for the issue of the relevant Notes 
(d)
Series notify the Fund and the Seller the termination of the corresponding Notes 
Subscription Agreement before the disbursement of the Notes on the Disbursement 
Date upon the occurrence of any of the following events: 
(i) 
an Insolvency Event has occurred with respect to the Seller before the 
disbursement of the relevant Notes on the Disbursement Date; or 
(ii) 
the General Reserve is not funded up to the General Reserve Required 
Amount specified in the relevant Issuing Document, (i) with respect to the 
first Note Series issued on the Fund Incorporation Date, before the 


 
23 
disbursement of the Notes on the Disbursement Date, (ii) with respect to the 
subsequent Note Series issued by the Fund, on the Issue Date; or 
(iii) 
the Commingling Reserve is not funded up to the Commingling Reserve 
Required Amount specified in the relevant Issuing Document, (i) with respect 
to the first Note Series issued on the Fund Incorporation Date, before the 
disbursement of the Notes on the Disbursement Date, (ii) with respect to the 
subsequent Note Series issued by the Fund, on the Issue Date; or 
(iv) 
the Seller (as Expenses Subordinated Facility Provider) has not made 
available to the Fund under the Expenses Subordinated Facility an amount 
equal to (i) with respect to the first Note Series issued on the Fund 
Incorporation date, the Initial Expenses and the Note Series Issue Expenses 
before the disbursement of the Notes on the Disbursement Date and (ii) with 
respect to any other Note Series, the Note Series Issue Expenses on or prior 
the relevant Issue Date of such Note Series; or 
(v) 
the Notes of the corresponding Note Series are not fully subscribed for by the 
relevant subscriber(s) by the expiry of the Subscription Period; or 
(vi) 
the Notes of the corresponding Note Series are not fully paid up by the 
relevant subscriber(s) on the relevant Disbursement Date.  
The early termination of the issue of a Note Series (other than as described below with respect 
to the issue of the Note Series to be made on the Fund Incorporation Date) shall not constitute 
a Fund Liquidation Event nor imply the extinguishment of the Fund in any manner 
whatsoever and shall not affect nor cause the termination of any of the Note Series previously 
issued by the Fund.  
If the Note Series to be issued on the Fund Incorporation Date is early terminated in 
accordance with section 4.4.7.1 of the Registration Document for any reason (other than the 
occurrence of the event foreseen in paragraph (d)(i) of such section 4.4.7.1), the Purchase 
Price of the initial portfolio of Eligible Receivables shall be funded with a drawing under the 
Seller Interest Credit Facility. 
2.6.2. Early liquidation of the Fund 
If the Note Series to be issued on the Fund Incorporation Date is early terminated in 
accordance with section 4.4.7.2 of the Registration Document upon the occurrence of the 
event foreseen in paragraph (d)(i) of section 4.4.7.1, the Fund will be terminated by the 
Management Company. 
In the event foreseen in the preceding paragraph, the transfer of the Receivables to the Fund 
made under the Deed of Incorporation, the issue of the Notes Series issued on the Fund 
Incorporation Date, as well as the rest of agreements of the Fund will be terminated and the 
Fund will be extinguished. The Seller shall pay all the Initial Expenses and the Note Series 


 
24 
Issue Expenses incurred as a result of the incorporation of the Fund and the issue of the Notes 
Series issued on the Fund Incorporation Date. 
2.7. 
The Servicer 
Without prejudice that the obligations to manage and service the Receivables correspond 
initially to the Management Company as master servicer of the Purchased Receivables (in 
such condition, the Master Servicer) in accordance with article 26.1 b) of Law 5/2015, of 27 
April, on the Business Financing Promotion (Ley 5/2015, de 27 de abril, de Fomento de la 
Financiación Empresarial) (Law 5/2015), the custody and servicing of the Receivables will 
be carried out by SFC (in such condition, the Servicer) as services provider without such 
appointment implying a limitation of the liability of the Management vis-à-vis the noteholders 
and any funder of the Fund, in accordance with the terms described in section 3.7.2 of the 
Additional Building Block and in the Deed of Incorporation.  
If a Servicer Termination Event occurs (as this is defined in section 3.7.2.15 of the Additional 
Building Block), then the Fund will be entitled to terminate the appointment of the Servicer 
and the Management Company, acting in the name and on behalf of the Fund as Master 
Servicer and as back-up servicer facilitator in accordance with section 3.7.2.15 of the 
Additional Building Block, shall use its reasonable endeavours to find, select and appoint a 
new servicer (also as services provider) in its place.  
Any change in the Servicer could delay collection of payments on the Receivables and 
ultimately could adversely affect the ability of the Fund to make payments in full on the 
Notes.  
If a Servicer Termination Event occurs, there can be no assurance that a replacement servicer 
with sufficient experience in servicing the Receivables would be found who would be willing 
and able to service the Receivables on the terms, or substantially similar terms, set out in 
section 3.7.2.1 of the Additional Building Block. No assurance can be given that such 
replacement servicer will not charge fees in excess of the fees to be paid to the Servicer.  
Furthermore, it may be that the terms on which a replacement servicer may be appointed are 
substantially different from those set out in section 3.7.2.1 of the Additional Building Block 
and the terms may be such that the Noteholders may be adversely affected. The ability of a 
replacement servicer to fully perform the required services would depend, among other 
things, on the information, software and records available at the time of the appointment. 
Transition from a servicer to a replacement servicer may result in delays in the performance 
of servicing functions. Any delay or inability to appoint a replacement servicer may affect 
payments on the Receivables and hence the Fund's ability to make payments when due on the 
Notes. 
The Noteholders have no right to give orders or directions to the Management Company in 
relation to the duties and/or appointment or removal of the Servicer. Such rights are vested 
solely in the Management Company. 


 
25 
In addition, Noteholders should be aware that the Servicer has no obligation itself to advance 
payments that Borrowers fail to make in a timely fashion. 
2.8. 
Liquidity  
Class A Notes, Class B Notes and Class C Notes of any Notes Series may be unlisted or listed 
on the AIAF Fixed Income Market (AIAF), the Alternative Fixed-Income Market (MARF) 
or any other regulated or unregulated market. There is no guarantee that a minimum volume or 
frequency of Notes transactions will be forthcoming in the market. There is no entity required 
to intervene in the secondary market, providing liquidity to the Notes by offering itself as 
counterparty. In particular, neither the Arrangers nor any global coordinator, lead manager 
(including the Joint Lead Managers), bookrunner or underwriter nor any of their affiliates are 
obliged to intervene in the secondary market, providing liquidity to the Notes. 
A prolonged reduction in demand for asset-backed or other debt securities, alone or in 
combination with the continuing increase in prevailing market interest rates, may adversely 
affect the market value of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes or the Class C Notes, the 
ability of the Noteholders to sell the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes or the Class C Notes or 
acquire credit protection on the Notes and may cause significant fluctuations in the market 
value of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes or the Class C Notes. Any of the above may 
result in significant losses to the Noteholders. 
Furthermore, outside the optional redemption as set forth in section 4.9.5 of the Securities 
Note and in the case of Early Liquidation of the Fund upon the terms set forth in section 4.4.3 
of the Registration Document, the Fund may not early redeem the Notes. 
2.9. 
Issue of further Notes Series 
In accordance with the open nature of the Fund, the Fund may from time to time during the 
Programme Revolving Period issue further Notes Series without notice to existing 
Noteholders and without their consent and which may have different term from outstanding 
notes. Each issue of further Notes Series will be subject to the fulfilment of the Further Note 
Series Issuance Conditions Precedent set out in section 4.13.3 of the Securities Note have 
been satisfied.  
The issuance of new Note Series could adversely affect the timing and amount of payments 
on outstanding Notes of any Note Series. For example, some Note Series issued after any 
existing Note Series may have a higher interest rate than the existing Note Series. This could 
result in a reduction in the amounts available pay interest on any existing Note Series. 
If further Note Series are issued, the Available Amortisation Amount would be shared 
amongst all outstanding Notes with potential effects on the amounts payable towards the 
redemption of each outstanding Class A Note, each outstanding Class B Note and each 
outstanding Class C Note of any Note Series and making the rate at which they amortise 
slower than would otherwise be the case. This situation may arise by, for example:  


 
26 
 
the occurrence of a Revolving Termination Event (but no Accelerated Amortisation 
(a)
Event has occurred) and the commencement of the Programme Amortisation Period; 
or 
 
the occurrence of an Accelerated Amortisation Event and the commencement of the 
(b)
Programme Accelerated Amortisation Period. 
In order to mitigate this risk it should be noted that: 
 
the Scheduled Amortisation Starting Date of any new Note Series shall only fall after 
(a)
the Scheduled Amortisation Starting Date of any previously issued Note Series which 
remains outstanding on the Issue Date of such new Note Series; and 
 
a fixed ratio of allocation of principal (i.e. the Note Series 20xx-yy Principal Ratio) 
(b)
between the outstanding Note Series which enable a faster amortisation of any Note 
Series compared to a pro rata allocation and to preserve the economic interests of 
previously issued Note Series has been set up (subject to an automatic reset in case of 
further issue of a Note Series or a full redemption). 
2.10. 
Prepayments or payment rate 
Faster than expected rates of prepayments or principal payment rate on the Receivables will 
cause the Fund to make payments of principal on the Notes earlier than expected and will 
shorten the maturity of the Notes of any Note Series. Prepayments or higher payment rate on 
the Receivables may occur as a result of (i) prepayments of Receivables by Borrowers in 
whole or in part; (ii) increase of the instalments by the Borrowers above the minimum 
contractual instalments; (iii) liquidations and other recoveries due to default and (iv) 
repurchases by the Seller of any Receivables. A wide variety of economic, social and other 
factors will influence the rate of prepayments on the Receivables. No prediction can be made 
as to the actual prepayment rates that will be experienced on the Receivables. 
If principal is paid on the Notes of any Notes Series earlier than expected due to prepayments 
on the Receivables (such prepayments occurring at a time when interest rates are lower than 
interest rates that would otherwise be applied if such prepayments have not been made or 
made at a different time), Noteholders may not be able to reinvest the principal in a 
comparable security with an effective interest rate equivalent to the interest rate on the Notes 
of any Note Series. Similarly, if principal payments on the Notes of any Note Series are made 
later than expected due to slower than expected prepayments or payments on the Receivables, 
Noteholders may lose reinvestment opportunities. Noteholders will bear all reinvestment risk 
resulting from receiving payments of principal on the Notes of any Note Series earlier or later 
than expected. 
2.11. 
Early redemption of the Notes 
In accordance with section 4.9.5 of the Securities Note, subject to certain conditions, the 
Seller may be entitled to instruct the Management Company to exercise on behalf of the Fund 
(i) the optional redemption of the relevant Note Series on the applicable Note Series 20xx-yy 


 
27 
Clean-Up Call Date or (ii) the optional redemption of the relevant Note Series on the Note 
Series 20xx-yy Call Date specified in the applicable Issuing Document.  
If a Notes Series is redeemed earlier than expected due to the exercise by the Fund 
(following instructions of the Seller) of the early redemption of such Note Series (such 
early redemption occurring at a time when interest rates are lower than interest rates that 
would otherwise be applied if such early redemption has not been made or made at a 
different time), Noteholders may not be able to reinvest the principal in a comparable security 
with an effective interest rate equivalent to the interest rate on the Notes of any Note 
Series. Noteholders will bear all reinvestment risk resulting from early redemption of the 
Notes of any Note Series earlier than expected. 
2.12. 
General Investment Considerations 
The Notes Series are addressed solely to qualified investors as defined in article 39 of Royal 
Decree 1310/2005, of 4 November, partly developing the Law 24/1988, of 28 July, on the 
Spanish Securities Market Law in regard to admission to trading of securities in official 
secondary markets, public offerings for sale or subscription and the Base Prospectus required 
for that purpose (the Royal Decree 1310/2015). 
The Notes of any Notes Series are limited recourse instruments and there can be no assurance 
that the Noteholders will receive the full amounts payable at any time by the Fund under the 
Notes or that they will receive any return on their investment in the Notes. Prospective 
investors are therefore advised to review this Base Prospectus, any supplement to the Base 
Prospectus prepared by the Management Company in accordance with article 22 of Royal 
Decree 1310/2005 (each, a Prospectus Supplement) and the Issuing Document of each Note 
Series carefully and consider, among other things, the risk factors set out in this section before 
deciding whether to invest in the Notes of any Notes Series.  
Prospective investors should also ensure they understand the nature of the Notes and the 
extent of their exposure to risk when they consider the suitability of investing in such Notes in 
light of their own circumstances and financial conditions. The Arrangers and any global 
coordinator, lead manager (including the Joint Lead Managers), bookrunner or underwriter 
have not undertaken to review the financial condition or affairs of the Seller or the Fund 
during the life of the arrangements contemplated by this Base Prospectus, or to advise any 
investor or potential investor in the Notes or any information that is not included in this Base 
Prospectus that comes to the attention of the Arrangers and any global coordinator, lead 
manager (including the Joint Lead Managers), bookrunner or underwriter. 
2.13. 
Certain material interests and potential for conflicts 
Certain parties to the transaction have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, 
investment banking and/or commercial banking or other services for the Fund (including the 
placement and underwriting of the Notes of any Notes Series), the Seller or its affiliates and 
the Management Company in the ordinary course of business. Other parties to the transaction 
may also perform multiple roles. Accordingly, conflicts of interest may exist or may arise as a 
result of parties having previously engaged or in the future engaging in transactions with 


 
28 
other parties, having multiple roles or carrying out other transactions for third parties. The 
parties to the transaction may be replaced by one or more new parties. It cannot be excluded 
that such a new party could also have a potential conflicting interest, which might ultimately 
have a negative impact on the ability of the Fund to perform its obligations in respect of the 
Notes. 
In particular, the Arrangers and any global coordinator, lead manager (including the Joint 
Lead Managers), bookrunner or underwriter and their affiliates may play various roles in 
relation to the offering of the Notes. 
The Arrangers and any global coordinator, lead manager (including the Joint Lead Managers), 
bookrunner or underwriter may assist clients and counterparties in transactions related to the 
Notes (including assisting clients in future purchases and sales of the Notes and hedging 
transactions). The Arrangers and any global coordinator, lead manager (including the Joint 
Lead Managers), bookrunner or underwriter expect to earn fees and other revenues from these 
transactions. 
The Arrangers and any global coordinator, lead manager (including the Joint Lead Managers), 
bookrunner or underwriter are part of global investment banking and securities and 
investment management firms that provide a wide range of financial services to a substantial 
and diversified client base that includes corporations, financial institutions, governments and 
high-net-worth individuals. As such, they actively make markets in and trade financial 
instruments for their own account and for the account of customers in the ordinary course of 
their business. The Arrangers and any global coordinator, lead manager (including the Joint 
Lead Managers), bookrunner or underwriter will act in their own commercial interest in their 
various capacities without regard to whether their interests conflict with those of the holders 
of the Notes or any other party.  
In the ordinary course of business, the Arrangers and any global coordinator, lead manager 
(including the Joint Lead Managers), bookrunner or underwriter and their employees or 
customers may actively trade in and/or otherwise hold long or short positions in the Notes, or 
enter into transactions similar to or referencing the Notes or the other instruments for their 
own accounts and for the accounts of their customers. The Arrangers and any global 
coordinator, lead manager (including the Joint Lead Managers), bookrunner or underwriter do 
not disclose specific trading positions except where required in accordance with applicable 
law. If any of the Arrangers or any global coordinator, lead manager (including the Joint Lead 
Managers), bookrunner or underwriter become owners of any of the Notes, through market-
making activity or otherwise, any actions that they take in their capacity as owner, including 
voting, providing consents or otherwise will not necessarily be aligned with the interests of 
other owners of the same class or other classes of the Notes of any Notes Series. To the extent 
the Arrangers and any global coordinator, lead manager (including the Joint Lead Managers), 
bookrunner or underwriter make a market in the Notes of any Notes Series (which they are 
under no obligation to do), they would expect to receive income from the spreads between 
their bid and offer prices for the Notes. In connection with any such activity, they will have 
no obligation to take, refrain from taking or cease taking any action with respect to these 
transactions and activities based on the potential effect on an investor in the Notes of the 


 
29 
relevant Notes Series. The price at which the Arrangers and any global coordinator, lead 
manager (including the Joint Lead Managers), bookrunner or underwriter may be willing to 
purchase Notes, if they make a market, will depend on market conditions and other relevant 
factors and may be significantly lower than the issue price for the Notes and significantly 
lower than the price at which they may be willing to sell the Notes. 
Accordingly, conflicts of interest may exist or may arise as a result of parties to this 
transaction: (a) having previously engaged or in the future engaging in transactions with other 
parties to the transaction; (b) having multiple roles in this transaction; and/or (c) carrying out 
other roles or transactions for third parties. 
2.14. 
Change of counterparties 
The parties to the Programme Documents who receive and hold monies or provide support to 
the transaction pursuant to the terms of such documents (such as Issuer Accounts Bank) are 
required to satisfy certain criteria to continue to be counterparty to the Fund.  
These criteria include requirements in relation to the short-term and long-term unguaranteed 
and unsecured ratings ascribed to such party by the Relevant Rating Agencies. If the party 
concerned ceases to satisfy the applicable criteria, then the rights and obligations of that party 
(including the right or obligation to receive monies on behalf of the Fund) may be required to 
be transferred to another entity which does satisfy the applicable ratings criteria. In these 
circumstances, the terms agreed with the replacement entity may not be as favourable as those 
agreed with the original party and the cost to the Fund may therefore increase. In addition, it 
may not be possible to find an entity with the required ratings that would be willing to act in 
such role. This may reduce amounts available to the Fund to make payments of interest and 
principal on the Notes and/or lead to a downgrade in the ratings of the Rated Notes. 
In addition, should the applicable criteria cease to be satisfied, then the parties to the relevant 
Programme Document may agree to amend or waive certain of the terms of such document, 
including the applicable criteria (although this will not apply to mandatory provisions of law), 
in order to avoid the need for a replacement entity to be appointed. The consent of 
Noteholders may not be required in relation to such amendments and/or waivers. 
3. 
RISKS DERIVING FROM THE LEGAL STATUS AND BUSINESS OF THE FUND 
3.1. 
Nature of the Fund and obligations of the Management Company 
The Fund is an isolated pool of assets with not legal personality open both on the assets and 
liability side such that is entitled to acquire additional Receivables and issue successive Notes 
Series during the life of the Fund. All the Receivables pooled in the Fund from time to time 
will serve to secure the payment of all the obligations derived from all the Notes under all 
Notes Series issued by the Fund and constitute its liabilities at that time.  
Pursuant to Law 5/2015 the Fund is managed by a Management Company duly licensed for 
such purposes. The Fund’s liability for its obligations vis-à-vis its creditors (including the 
holders of the Notes) shall be limited in recourse to its assets and payments are subject to the 


 
30 
applicable Priority of Payments, and none of the Management Company, the Arrangers, any 
global coordinator, lead manager (including the Joint Lead Managers), bookrunner or 
underwriter, the Eligible Hedging Counterparties or any of the other transaction parties shall 
be responsible for any of the Fund’s liabilities. 
The Management Company will perform for the Fund those duties attributed to it in Law 
5/2015, as well as safeguarding the best interest of the holders of the Notes and generally the 
creditors of the Fund. The Noteholders will not be entitled to give directions or instructions to 
the Management Company in relation to the exercise of their respective rights.  
The Noteholders and the other ordinary creditors of the Fund shall not have any right of 
action either against the Fund or against the Management Company other than that deriving 
from non-performance of their respective duties or non-compliance with the provisions of 
the Deed of Incorporation, this Base Prospectus or the applicable laws and regulations. Any 
such actions will need to be resolved in the (corresponding) judicial proceedings.  
Hence, the Noteholders will have no recourse to the Fund or the Management Company based 
only on delinquency or payment default of the Receivables or breach of agreement by third 
parties.  
3.2. 
Certain features of the Fund and the Programme have been created in the interest of the Seller  
Pursuant to the Deed of Incorporation and as described in the Base Prospectus, the Fund and 
the Programme have certain features that have been designed in the interest of the Seller. 
In this regard, amongst others, the Seller is entitled to: 
 
direct the Management Company to carry out an issue by the Fund of a new Note 
(a)
Series; 
 
direct the Management Company to liquidate the Fund where (i) the aggregate 
(b)
Principal Amount Outstanding of all outstanding Notes is equal or less than 10% of 
the aggregate Initial Principal Amount thereof or (ii) the Notes issued by the Fund are 
held solely by the Seller or there are no Notes outstanding and the Seller requests the 
liquidation of the Fund, in accordance with section 4.4.3 of the Registration 
Document; 
 
subject to certain conditions, send a Seller's Optional Early Redemption Written 
(c)
Instruction in order for the Management Company to exercise on behalf of the Fund 
(i) the optional redemption of the relevant Note Series on the applicable Note Series 
20xx-yy Clean-Up Call Date or (ii) the optional redemption of the relevant Note 
Series on the Note Series 20xx-yy Call Date specified in the applicable Issuing 
Document, in accordance with section 4.9.5 of the Securities Note; 
 
repurchase certain Purchased Receivables from the Fund (including Purchased 
(d)
Receivables arising from Performing Client Accounts), in accordance with section 
3.3.1.12 of the Additional Building Block; 


 
31 
 
reserve the right to subscribe for all or part of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes (if 
(e)
any) or the Class C Notes of a given Note Series. In case where the Seller subscribe 
all the Class A Notes, Class B Notes or the Class C Notes of such Note Series, such 
Notes shall not be placed with any investor, in accordance with section 4.13.6 of the 
Securities Note. 
The interests of the Seller may not be at all times aligned with those of the rest of the holders 
of the Notes and, therefore, this circumstance should be taken into consideration by the 
investor when acquiring the Notes. 
3.3. 
Mandatory replacement of the Management Company 
In accordance with article 33 of Law 5/2015, if the Management Company is subject to 
an insolvency proceeding (concurso), without prejudice to the effects of such insolvency 
proceeding (as described below), it shall find another management company to replace it. 
Similarly, in case that its authorisation to act as management company of securitisation funds 
were revoked, a new management company replacing it would need to be found. If four (4) 
months have elapsed since the occurrence of the event requiring the replacement and a new 
management company that is prepared to take over the management of the Fund has not been 
found, a trigger event for the Early Liquidation of the Fund will occur and the Notes, and (i) 
the Expenses Subordinated Facility, (ii) the General Reserve Subordinated Facility, (iii) the 
Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility and (iv) the Seller Interest Credit Facility (as 
these terms are defined in sections 3.4.4.1, 3.4.3.7, 3.4.3.8 and 3.4.4.4 respectively) (the 
Subordinated Facilities) will be redeemed or repaid, as the case may be, in accordance with 
the provisions of the Deed of Incorporation and this Base Prospectus in particular in 
accordance with the Accelerated Priority of Payments set out in section 3.4.7.2 of the 
Additional Building Block.   
3.4. 
Insolvency  
The insolvency proceeding (concurso) of any of the parties involved (whether it be the Seller, 
the Management Company, the Issuer Accounts Bank, the Servicer or any other counterparty 
of the Fund) could affect their contractual relations with the Fund as provided in Law 22/2003, 
of 9 July, on Insolvency (Ley 22/2003, de 9 de julio, Ley Concursal) (the Insolvency Law) and 
consequently the ability of the Fund to meets its obligations under the Notes. 
Pursuant to the provisions of the Second Additional Provision of the Insolvency Law, the 
insolvency provisions of Law 5/2015 will apply.  
In the event of the insolvency of the Seller, and in accordance with article 16 of Law 5/2015 
(by reference to article 15 of Law 2/1981), the transfer of the Receivables to the Fund may 
only be rescinded or challenged under article 71 of the Insolvency Law by the insolvency 
administration (administración concursal) and in so challenging, the insolvency 
administration will have to prove the existence of fraud in the transfer.  


 
32 
Furthermore, all Fund’s assets held by the Seller, except for cash, due to the fungible nature 
thereof, will become the property of the Fund and must be made available under the terms of 
articles 80 and 81 of the Insolvency Law. 
According to the interpretation of a majority of legal scholars regarding articles 80 and 81 of 
the Insolvency Law, if the Seller is declared insolvent, monies received and held thereby on 
behalf of the Fund in its capacity as counterparty to certain agreements executed before the 
date of declaration of insolvency may be affected by the results of the insolvency. 
If the Management Company is declared under an insolvency proceeding (concurso), it 
must be replaced by another management company in accordance with the provisions of 
section 3.3 above. In the event of the insolvency proceeding (concurso) of the Management 
Company, any assets of the Fund that are in the possession of the Management Company and 
in respect of which the Management Company has no right of use, surety or retention -
except for money due to its fungible nature- and that form part of the latter's assets will be 
construed as belonging to the Fund, and the insolvency officials (administración concursal) 
must deliver them to the Fund. 
In practice, due to the nature of the securitisation transaction in question, and except in the 
event of a breach by the parties, no cash amounts will become part of the assets of the 
Management Company since the amounts that constitute the revenues of the Fund must be 
deposited, in accordance with the terms set forth in the Deed of Incorporation and this Base 
Prospectus, in the accounts opened on behalf of the Fund by the Management Company 
(which will be involved in opening such accounts not only as the agent of the Fund, but as its 
legal representative). Therefore the Fund will have full separation right over those assets from 
those of the Management Company, in the terms set forth in articles 80 and 81 of the 
Insolvency Law. 
Additionally, in the event that SFC, as Servicer and the entity that will collect the amounts 
paid deriving from the Receivables, is declared under an insolvency proceeding (concurso), 
the Fund, acting through its Management Company, will be entitled to receive from SFC the 
amounts derived from the Receivables from the date that it is declared insolvent, because such 
amounts will be construed as owned by the Fund, and therefore must be transferred to the 
Management Company on behalf of the Fund. However, as collections from the Borrowers 
are initially paid to a number of accounts opened in the Collections Accounts, moneys may 
cease to be traceable due to their fungible nature during the period in which they are held by 
SFC as Servicer at the Collections Accounts Banks. For this period of time, the Noteholders 
will be exposed to the credit quality of the Collections Accounts Banks. In order to mitigate 
the commingling risk derived from a potential insolvency of the Servicer, SFC as Servicer has 
agreed to grant in rem rights of pledge over the Collections Accounts in favour of the Fund 
pursuant to the Collections Accounts Security Document. 
The mechanisms available for mitigating such risk are described in section 3.4.3 of the 
Additional Building Block.  
In addition, the Issuer Accounts Bank and the Collections Accounts Banks are subject to Law 
11/2015, of 18 June 2015, on the recovery and resolution of credit entities and investment 


 
33 
firms (Ley 11/2015, de 18 de junio, de recuperación y resolución de entidades de crédito y 
empresas de servicios de inversion), which implements in Spain the Directive 2014/59/EU of 
the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 establishing a framework for the 
recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment firms. Application of those 
provisions may delay or in certain cases impede the recovery of the amounts deposited in 
accounts opened in the Issuer Accounts Bank or the Collections Accounts Banks. 
The Fund, being incorporated as an isolated pool of assets with not legal personality pursuant 
to Law 5/2015 is not subject to insolvency proceedings under the Insolvency Law. 
With respect to the Collections Accounts Security Document, it should be noted that the 
European Union Court of Justice (the EUCJ) has recently issued a judgment (Judgement on 
case 156/15 dated 10 November 2016) interpreting certain provisions of Directive 2002/47 of 
the European Parliament and Council of 6 June 2002 on financial collateral arrangements 
setting out that financial collateral granted by means of a pledge of monies deposited in a 
bank account provides the beneficiary the right to enforce the relevant collateral, 
notwithstanding the commencement of insolvency proceedings in respect of the collateral 
provider, only if (i) the monies covered by the collateral were deposited in the bank account 
in question before the commencement of the debtor’s insolvency proceedings (or those 
monies were deposited on the day of commencement provided that the creditor proves that it 
was not aware, nor should have been aware, that those insolvency proceedings had 
commenced) and (ii) the account holder was prevented from disposing of those monies after 
they had been deposited in the relevant bank account. 
Since this is a very recent judgment, how Spanish Courts may finally apply the doctrine set 
out therein to actual cases decided under Spanish law and whether it may result in the 
Collections Accounts Security Document being regarded as not qualifying for the protections 
afforded by of Royal Decree Law 5/2005 of 11 March, on urgent reforms to encourage, 
among others, productivity and improve public procurement (Real Decreto Ley 5/2005, de 11 
de marzo, de reformas urgentes para el impulso a la productividad y para la mejora de la 
contratación pública) (Royal Decree Law 5/2005) (and which implements in Spain Directive 
2002/47) is uncertain.  
However, in light of the interpretation given by the EUCJ in the aforementioned Judgment, 
there is a risk that if cash amounts are not immobilised under the Collections Accounts 
Security Document, the pledge created thereunder may be regarded by Spanish Courts as not 
qualifying as financial collateral (garantías financieras) for the purposes of Royal Decree 
Law 5/2005. This could imply an impact on the commingling risk assumed by the Fund 
derived from a potential insolvency of the Servicer (which could be higher than the 
Commingling Reserve Amount available on such date) and, ultimately, on the ability of the 
Fund to meets its payment obligations under the Notes.  
3.5. 
Breach of agreements by third parties 
The Fund has entered into agreements with third parties for the provision of certain services 
in relation to the operation of the Fund and in relation to the Notes (as further described in the 
different sections of the Additional Building Block describing the Programme Documents). 


 
34 
The Noteholders could be prejudiced if any of the referred counterparties fails to fulfil any of 
the obligations assumed under any of the aforementioned agreements. Nevertheless, certain 
mechanisms are contemplated in the relevant agreements to mitigate such possible breaches. 
All the foregoing is without prejudice to the legal consequences of any breach by the 
corresponding counterparties of the applicable contractual provisions or derived from the 
Spanish legislation. 
3.6. 
Eurosystem eligibility 
The Class A Notes of any Notes Series may be held in a manner which will allow Eurosystem 
eligibility. Class A Notes of any Notes Series are intended upon issue to be deposited with 
Sociedad de Gestión de los Sistemas de Registro, Compensación y Liquidación de Valores 
(IBERCLEAR), but given that, amongst others, Class A Notes of a Note Series may be 
unlisted Notes or represented in physical titles, does not necessarily mean that all Class A 
Notes of any Notes Series will be recognised as eligible collateral for Eurosystem monetary 
policy and intra-day credit operations by the Eurosystem (Eurosystem Eligible Collateral) 
either upon issue or at any or all times during their life.  
Such recognition will, inter alia, depend upon satisfaction of the Eurosystem eligibility 
criteria set out in the Guideline of the European Central Bank (the ECB) of 19 December 
2014 on implementation of the Eurosystem monetary policy framework (ECB/2014/60) as 
amended and applicable from time to time (the Guideline). In addition, the Management 
Company (based on information supplied by the Servicer) will, for as long as the Class A 
Notes of any Notes Series are intended to be held in a manner which will allow Eurosystem 
eligibility, make loan-level data available in such manner as required by the ECB to comply 
with the Eurosystem eligibility criteria, subject to applicable data protection rules. 
None of the Fund, the Management Company, the Seller, the Eligible Hedging 
Counterparties, the Arrangers and any global coordinator, lead manager (including the Joint 
Lead Managers), bookrunner or underwriter gives or will give any representation, warranty, 
confirmation or guarantee to any investor in the Class A Notes that the Class A Notes will, 
either upon issue, or at any or at all times during their life, satisfy all or any requirements for 
Eurosystem eligibility and be recognised as Eurosystem Eligible Collateral for any reason 
whatsoever. Any potential investor in the Class A Notes of any Notes Series should extract its 
own conclusions and seek its own advice with respect to whether or not the Class A Notes 
constitute Eurosystem Eligible Collateral. 
It is expected that Class B Notes and Class C Notes will not qualify as Eurosystem eligible 
given that Class B Notes and Class C Notes are subordinated. 
3.7. 
U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance withholding may affect payments on the Notes  
Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) impose a 
new reporting regime and, potentially, a 30 per cent. withholding tax with respect to (i) 
certain payments from sources within the United States, (ii) “foreign pass through payments” 
made to certain non-U.S. financial institutions (for the purposes of this section any such non-
U.S. financial institution, an FFI) that do not comply with this new reporting regime, and (iii) 


 
35 
payments to certain investors that do not provide identification information with respect to 
interests issued by a participating FFI (for the purposes of this section collectively 
Withholdable Payments). 
Whilst the Notes are held within the clearing systems, in all but the most remote 
circumstances, it is not expected that FATCA will affect the amount of any payment received 
by the clearing systems. However, FATCA may affect payments made to custodians or 
intermediaries in the subsequent payment chain leading to the ultimate investor if any such 
custodian or intermediary generally is unable to receive payments free of FATCA 
withholding. It also may affect payment to any ultimate investor that is a financial institution 
that is not entitled to receive payments free of withholding under FATCA, or an ultimate 
investor that fails to provide its broker (or other custodian or intermediary from which it 
receives payment) with any information, forms, other documentation or consents that may be 
necessary for the payments to be made free of FATCA withholding. Investors should choose 
the custodians or intermediaries with care (to ensure each is compliant with FATCA or other 
laws or agreements related to FATCA) and provide each custodian or intermediary with any 
information, forms, other documentation or consents that may be necessary for such custodian 
or intermediary to make a payment free of FATCA withholding.  
The Fund's obligations under the Notes are discharged once it has paid the clearing systems, 
and the Fund has therefore no responsibility for any amount thereafter transmitted through the 
clearing systems and custodians or intermediaries. 
The United States and the Government of the Kingdom of Spain have entered into an 
intergovernmental agreement to facilitate the implementation of FATCA (for the purposes of 
this section, the IGA). An FFI (such as the Fund) that complies with the terms of the IGA, as 
well as applicable local law requirements will not be subject to withholding under FATCA 
with respect to Withholdable Payments that it receives. Further, an FFI that complies with the 
terms of the IGA will not be required to withhold under FATCA on payments it makes to 
Noteholders of such FFI (unless it has agreed to do so under the U.S. “qualified 
intermediary,” “withholding foreign partnership,” or “withholding foreign trust” regimes). 
Pursuant to the IGA, an FFI is required to report certain information in respect of certain of its 
Noteholders to its home government, whereupon such information will be provided to the 
U.S. Internal Revenue Service. The Fund will undertake to comply with the IGA and any 
local implementing legislation, but there is no assurance that it will be able to do so. 
An FFI that fails to comply with the terms of the IGA may become subject to the FATCA 
Withholding described above. Additionally, a failure to comply with future local 
implementing legislation may result in negative consequences to an FFI. The imposition of 
the FATCA withholding on payments made to the Fund would reduce the profitability, and 
thus the cash available to make payments on the Notes. Prospective investors should consult 
their advisers about the potential application of FATCA. 
3.8. 
Economic conditions in the Euro-zone 
Concerns relating to credit risks (including that of sovereigns and those of entities which are 
exposed to sovereigns) persist, in particular, with respect to current economic, monetary and 


 
36 
political conditions in the Euro-zone. If such concerns further deteriorate (including as may 
be demonstrated by any relevant credit rating agency action, any default or restructuring of 
indebtedness by one or more states or institutions and/or any changes to, including any break-
up of, the Euro-zone), then these matters may cause further severe stress in the financial 
system generally and/or may adversely affect one or more of the parties to the Programme 
Documents (including the Seller and/or the Servicer). 
In particular, the economic conditions in the Euro-zone are further subject to the risks of 
slowdown and volatility as a result of the recent election in the United States and the 
considerable uncertainty surrounding the United Kingdom’s 23rd June, 2016 referendum on 
whether to exit the European Union and, given the United Kingdom public’s vote to leave the 
European Union, the considerable uncertainty as to the political implementation of that 
mandate, the nature and timing of such an exit, the risk of contagion in other member states 
and whether and to what extent this could continue to negatively impact the European 
markets or even the future of Euro-zone. It is also not possible to determine the impact that 
these matters will have on the business of the Fund (including the performance of the 
underlying Purchased Receivables), any other party to the Programme Documents and/or any 
debtor in respect of the underlying Purchased Receivables, or on the regulatory position of 
any such entity or of the transactions contemplated by the Programme Documents under EU 
regulation or more generally. 
Additionally, political uncertainty in Spain increased due to the recent rise of new political 
parties and coalitions. The lack of a stable majorities in the Spanish Parliament may result in 
extended political negotiations to adopt structural reforms and new legislations and could 
therefore eventually increase the uncertainty in Spain. Therefore, despite the recent 
improvement in the European financial markets and the recovery of Spain’s economy, 
uncertainty may persist in the coming months. 
Given the current uncertainties and the range of possible outcomes, no assurance can be given 
as to the impact of any of the matters described above and, in particular, no assurance can be 
given that such matters would not adversely affect the rights of the Noteholders, the market 
value of the Notes and/or the ability of the Fund to satisfy its obligations under the Notes. 
For these purposes, Euro-Zone means the region comprised of member states of the 
European Union that adopt the single currency in accordance with the Treaty establishing the 
European Community (signed in Rome on 25 March 1957), as amended by the Treaty on 
European Union (signed in Maastricht on 7 February 1992). 
3.9. 
Volcker Rule. Status of the Fund 
Under Section 619 of the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 
and the corresponding implementing rules (the Volcker Rule), “banking entities” are 
prohibited from, engaging in proprietary trading or from acquiring or retaining any 
“ownership interest” in, or acting as “sponsor” of, or having certain relationships with, certain 
investment vehicles referred to in the Volcker Rule as “covered funds”, except as may be 
permitted by an applicable exclusion or exception from the Volcker Rule. In general, there is 


 
37 
limited interpretive guidance regarding the Volcker Rule and the general effects of the 
Volcker Rule remain uncertain.  
At the time of constitution, the Fund is structured so as to not constitute a “covered fund” 
based on Section __.10(c)(8) of the Volcker Rule, commonly referred to as the Loan 
Securitization Exclusion. It is possible, however, that U.S. regulators could take a contrary 
position and determine that the Issuer should not be excluded from the definition of “covered 
fund” under the Volcker Rule. Any prospective investor in the Note Series, including a U.S. 
or foreign bank or a subsidiary or other affiliate thereof, should consult its own legal advisers 
regarding the impact of such a determination and other potential effects of the Volcker Rule. 
4. 
CERTAIN REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS 
4.1. 
Regulatory initiatives may have an adverse impact on the regulatory treatment of the 
Notes. No assurance is given that the transaction will comply with LCR or Solvency II 
requirements 
In Europe, the U.S. and elsewhere there is increased political and regulatory scrutiny of the 
asset-backed securities industry. This has resulted in a raft of measures for increased 
regulation which are currently at various stages of implementation and which may have an 
adverse impact on the regulatory position for certain investors in securitisation exposures 
and/or on the incentives for certain investors to hold asset-backed securities, and may thereby 
affect the liquidity of such securities. Investors in the Notes are responsible for analysing their 
own regulatory position and none of the Fund, the Management Company, the Eligible 
Hedging Counterparties, the Arrangers, any global coordinator, lead manager (including the 
Joint Lead Managers), bookrunner or underwriter and any other party to the Programme 
Documents makes any representation to any prospective investor or purchaser of the Notes 
regarding the regulatory treatment of their investment on the Disbursement Date or at any 
time in the future. 
In particular, investors should note that the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (for the 
purposes of this section, BCBS) has approved significant changes to the Basel regulatory 
capital and liquidity framework (for the purposes of this section, such changes being 
commonly referred to as Basel III), including certain revisions to the securitisation 
framework. Basel III provides for a substantial strengthening of existing prudential rules, 
including new requirements intended to reinforce capital standards (with heightened 
requirements for global systemically important banks) and to establish a leverage ratio 
“backstop” for financial institutions and certain minimum liquidity standards (referred to as 
the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (for the purposes of this section, LCR) and the Net Stable 
Funding Ratio (for the purposes of this section, NSFR)). BCBS member countries agreed to 
implement Basel III from 1 January 2013, subject to transitional and phase-in arrangements 
for certain requirements (e.g. the LCR requirements refer to implementation from the start of 
2015, with full implementation by January 2019, and the NSFR requirements refer to 
implementation from January 2018). As implementation of any changes to the Basel 
framework (including those made via Basel III) requires national legislation, the final rules 
and the timetable for its implementation in each jurisdiction, as well as the treatment of asset-


 
38 
backed securities (e.g. as LCR eligible assets or not), may be subject to some level of national 
variation. It should also be noted that changes to regulatory capital requirements have been 
made for insurance and reinsurance undertakings through participating jurisdiction initiatives, 
such as the Solvency II framework in Europe (as this is defined in below). 
In addition, investors should be aware of the EU risk retention and due diligence requirements 
which currently apply, or are expected to apply in the future, in respect of various types of EU 
regulated investors including credit institutions, authorised alternative investment fund 
managers, investment firms, insurance and reinsurance undertakings, UCITS funds and 
institutions for occupational retirement provision. Amongst other things, such requirements 
restrict a relevant investor from investing in asset-backed securities unless (i) that investor is 
able to demonstrate that it has undertaken certain due diligence in respect of various matters 
including its Note position, the underlying assets and (in the case of certain types of investors) 
the relevant sponsor or originator and (ii) the originator, sponsor or original lender in respect 
of the relevant securitisation has explicitly disclosed to the investor that it will retain, on an 
on-going basis, a net economic interest of not less than 5 per cent. in respect of certain 
specified credit risk tranches or securitised exposures. Failure to comply with one or more of 
the requirements may result in various penalties including, in the case of those investors 
subject to regulatory capital requirements, the imposition of a penal capital charge on the 
Notes acquired by the relevant investor. Aspects of the requirements and what is or will be 
required to demonstrate compliance to national regulators remain unclear. 
It should be noted that the European Commission has published legislative proposals for two 
new regulations related to securitisation. Amongst other things, the proposals include 
provisions intended to implement the revised securitisation framework developed by BCBS 
and provisions intended to harmonise and replace the risk retention and due diligence 
requirements (including the corresponding guidance provided through technical standards) 
applicable to certain EU regulated investors. There are material differences between the 
legislative proposals and the current requirements including with respect to the applicable 
approach under the retention requirements and the originator entities eligible to retain the 
required interest. Moreover, further changes may be, and have been, proposed through the 
political negotiation process. It is not clear whether, and in what form, the legislative 
proposals (and any corresponding technical standards) will be adopted. In addition, the 
compliance position under any adopted revised requirements of transactions entered into prior 
to adoption, and of activities undertaken by a party (including an investor) in respect of such 
transactions, is currently uncertain. 
The risk retention and due diligence requirements described above apply, or are expected to 
apply, in respect of the Notes. With respect to the commitment of the Seller to retain a 
material net economic interest in the securitisation and with respect to the information to be 
made available by the Fund or another relevant party (or, after the Disbursement Date, by the 
Management Company on the Fund’s behalf), please see the statements set out in the section 
of this Base Prospectus headed “Certain Regulatory and Industry Disclosures”. Relevant 
investors are required to independently assess and determine the sufficiency of the 
information described above for the purposes of complying with any relevant requirements 
and none of the Fund, the Arrangers, any global coordinator, lead manager (including the 


 
39 
Joint Lead Managers), bookrunner or underwriter, the Eligible Hedging Counterparties or any 
other party to the transaction makes any representation that the information described above is 
sufficient in all circumstances for such purposes. 
Prospective investors should therefore make themselves aware of the changes and 
requirements described above (and any corresponding implementing rules of their regulator), 
where applicable to them, in addition to any other applicable regulatory requirements with 
respect to their investment in the Notes. The matters described above and any other changes 
to the regulation or regulatory treatment of the Notes for some or all investors may negatively 
impact the regulatory position of individual investors and, in addition, have a negative impact 
on the price and liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market. 
In addition, investors must carry out their own legal review and analysis, in order to 
determine whether: 
 
the Notes are deemed as high quality liquid assets for the purposes of the liquidity 
(a)
coverage ratio (LCR) established by the Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013 of the 
European Parliament and of the Council, of June 26th 2013, on prudential 
requirements for credit institutions and investment firms and amending the 
Regulation (EU) No. 648/2012 (CRR), as implemented by the Commission 
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61, of October 10th 2014, to supplement Regulation 
(EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and the Council with regard to 
liquidity coverage requirement for Credit Institutions and the national implementation 
measures and, if applicable, whether they are deemed Level 2A or Level 2B assets, as 
described by the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61, of October 10th 
2014, to supplement Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013 of the European Parliament and 
the Council with regard to liquidity coverage requirement for Credit Institutions; and 
 
the Notes shall be deemed as a Type 1 or Type 2 securitization investment, as 
(b)
described in article 254(2) of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35, of 
October 10th 2014, supplementing Directive 2009/138/EC of the European Parliament 
and of the Council on the taking-up and pursuit of the business of Insurance and 
Reinsurance (Solvency II Regulation). 
None of the Management Company, the Arrangers, the any global coordinator, lead manager 
(including the Joint Lead Managers), bookrunner or underwriter, the Seller or the Servicer 
makes any representation to any prospective investor or purchaser of the Notes as to these 
matters on the date of this Base Prospectus or at any time in the future. 
4.2. 
Impact of financial transaction taxes 
On 14 February 2013, the European Commission published its proposal (for the purposes of 
this section, the Commission’s Proposal) for a Council Directive implementing enhanced 
cooperation in the area of a financial transaction tax (for the purposes of this section, FTT), to 
be adopted in certain participating EU member states (including Belgium, Germany, Estonia, 
Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia, although Estonia has 
since stated that it will not participate).  


 
40 
The proposed Directive aims to ensure that the financial sector makes a fair and substantial 
contribution to covering the costs of the financial crisis and creating a level playing field with 
other sectors from a taxation point of view. A joint statement issued in May 2014 by ten of 
the eleven participating Member States indicated an intention to implement the FTT 
progressively, such that it would initially apply to shares and certain derivatives from 1 
January 2016, although the FTT proposal has not yet been introduced and still remains subject 
to negotiation between those states and the scope of any such tax is uncertain. It may 
therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. 
Additional EU member states may decide to participate. 
Under the Commission’s Proposal (as defined above) the FTT could apply in certain 
circumstances to persons both within and outside of the participating Member States. 
Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the Notes where at least one party is a 
financial institution, and at least one party is established in a participating Member State. A 
financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, “established” in a participating Member 
State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established 
in a participating Member State or (b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the 
dealings is issued in a participating Member State. 
The FTT may give rise to tax liabilities for the Fund with respect to certain transactions 
(including concluding swap transactions and/or purchases or sales of securities (such as 
authorised investments)) if it is adopted based on the Commission’s Proposal. Any such tax 
liabilities may reduce amounts available to the Fund to meet its obligations under the Notes 
and may result in investors receiving less interest or principal than expected.  
It should also be noted that the FTT could be payable in relation to relevant transactions by 
investors in respect of the Notes (including secondary market transactions) if the conditions 
for a charge to arise are satisfied and the FTT is adopted based on the Commission’s 
Proposal. Primary market transactions referred to in article 5(c) of Regulation (EC) No 
1287/2006 are expected to be exempt. 
Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation 
to the FTT. 
4.3. 
No assurance is given that the transaction will be designated as a simple, transparent 
securitisation 
On 30 September 2015, the European Commission published legislative proposals for two 
new regulations related to securitisation. Amongst others, the proposals include provisions 
intended to implement the revised securitisation framework developed by BCBS (the CRR 
Amendment Regulation) and provisions intended to harmonise and replace the risk retention 
and due diligence requirements applicable to certain EU regulated investors (the STS 
Regulation).  
The STS Regulation also aims to create common foundation criteria for identifying “STS 
securitisations”. There are still material differences between the legislative proposals and the 
current requirements (including with respect to application of retention requirements and the 


 
41 
originator entities eligible to retain the required interest). In addition, the compliance position 
under any adopted revised requirements of transactions entered into, and of activities 
undertaken by a party (including an investor), prior to adoption is uncertain. No assurance can 
be given that the transaction will be designated as an “STS securitisation” under the STS 
Regulation at any point in the future. 
Prospective investors should therefore make themselves aware of the changes and 
requirements described above (and any corresponding implementing rules). The matters 
described above and any other changes to the regulation or regulatory treatment of the Notes 
for some or all investors may negatively impact the regulatory position of individual investors 
and, in addition, have a negative impact on the price and liquidity of the Notes in the 
secondary market. 
4.4. 
Potential reform of Euribor determinations 
Financial market reference rates and their calculation and determination procedures have 
come under close public scrutiny in recent years. Starting in 2009, authorities in jurisdictions 
such as the European Union, the United States, Japan and others investigated cases of alleged 
misconduct around the rate-setting of LIBOR, Euribor and other reference rates. A number of 
initiatives to reform reference rate setting have been launched as a consequence by the 
regulatory and supervisory communities as well as the financial markets. These include the 
Final Report of ESMA-EBA on Principles for Benchmark-Setting Processes in the European 
Union published in June 2013 and the Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 of the European 
Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2016 on indices used as benchmarks in financial 
instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds and 
amending Directives 2008/48/EC and 2014/17/EU and Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 (for the 
purposes of this section, the Benchmark Regulation), which entered into force on 30 June 
2016. 
The Benchmark Regulation applies to “contributors”, “administrators” and “users of” 
benchmarks (such as Euribor and Libor) in the EU, and, among other things, (i) requires 
benchmark administrators to be authorised (or, if non-EU-based, to be subject to an 
equivalent regulatory regime) and to comply with extensive requirements in relation to the 
administration of “benchmarks” and (ii) ban the use of benchmarks of unauthorised 
administrators. 
Potential impacts of the Benchmark Regulation and other initiatives on the determination of 
Euribor in the future could be an increase of costs and risks of administering or otherwise 
participating in the setting of a benchmark and complying with any such regulations or 
requirements, changes in the rules or methodologies used in certain benchmarks or the 
disappearance of certain benchmarks. It is, however, not possible to ascertain as at the date of 
this Prospectus how such changes may impact the determination of Euribor for the purposes 
of the Notes and the Hedging Agreements, whether this will result in an increase or decrease 
in Euribor rates or whether such changes will have an adverse impact on the liquidity or the 
market value of the Notes. 


 
42 
4.5. 
Change of law 
The structure of the transaction described in this Base Prospectus and, inter alia, the issue of 
the Notes and the ratings which are to be assigned to the Rated Notes are based on the law 
and administrative practice in effect as at the date of this Base Prospectus as it affects the 
parties to the transaction and the Audited Portfolio and having regard to the expected tax 
treatment of all relevant entities under such law and practice. No assurance can be given as to 
the impact of any possible change to such law (including any change in regulation which may 
occur without a change in primary legislation), administrative practice or tax treatment after 
the date of this Base Prospectus nor can any assurance be given as to whether any such 
change would adversely affect the ability of the Fund to make payments under the Notes. 
In addition, it should be noted that regulatory requirements (including any applicable 
retention, due diligence or disclosure obligations) may be recast or amended and there can be 
no assurance that any such changes will not adversely affect the compliance position of a 
transaction described in this Base Prospectus or of any party under any applicable law or 
regulation. 
4.6. 
CRA3 
The Regulation (EU) No 462/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 May 
2013 amending the CRA Regulation (for the purposes of this section, CRA3) became 
effective on 20 June 2013. CRA3 provides for certain additional disclosure requirements 
which are applicable in relation to structured finance transactions. Such disclosures will need 
to be made via a website to be set up by ESMA.  
The precise scope and manner of such disclosure are subject to regulatory technical standards 
(for the purposes of this section, the CRA3 RTS) prepared by ESMA. On 30 September 
2014, the European Commission adopted three CRA3 RTS to implement provisions of the 
CRA3. The CRA3 RTS specify (i) the information that the issuer, originator and sponsor of a 
structured finance instrument established in the European Union must jointly disclose on the 
ESMA website, (ii) the frequency with which this information is to be updated and (iii) the 
presentation of this information by means of standardised disclosure templates.  
Additionally, CRA3 has introduced a requirement that where an issuer or related third parties 
(which term includes sponsors and originators) intends to solicit a credit rating of a structured 
finance instrument it will appoint at least two credit rating agencies and should consider 
appointing at least one rating agency having not more than a 10 per cent. total market share 
(as measured in accordance with article 8d(3) of the CRA (as amended by CRA3 RTS)) (for 
the purposes of this section, a small CRA), provided that a small CRA is capable of rating the 
relevant issuance or entity. Where the issuer or a related third party does not appoint at least 
one credit rating agency with no more than 10% market share, this must be documented. In 
order to give effect to those provisions of article 8d of CRA3, ESMA is required to annually 
publish a list of registered CRAs, their total market share, and the types of credit rating they 
issue.  


 
43 
Investors should consult their legal advisors as to the applicability of the CRA3 RTS and any 
consequences of non-compliance in respect of their investment in the Notes of any Note 
Series. 
4.7. 
European Market Infrastructure Regulation EU 648/2012 (EMIR) 
EMIR and the regulations made under it impose certain obligations on parties to OTC 
derivative contracts according to whether they are “financial counterparties” or “non-financial 
counterparties”. 
Financial counterparties (as defined in EMIR) will, depending on the identity of their 
counterparty, be subject to a general obligation (the “clearing obligation”) to clear all 
“eligible” OTC derivative contracts through a duly authorised or recognised central 
counterparty. They must also report the details of all derivative contracts to a trade repository 
(the “reporting obligation”) and in general undertake certain risk-mitigation techniques in 
respect of OTC derivative contracts which are not cleared by a central counterparty, including 
complying with requirements related to timely confirmation of terms, portfolio reconciliation, 
dispute resolution, daily valuation and margin posting (together, the “risk mitigation 
obligations”).  
Non-financial counterparties (as defined in EMIR) are not subject to the clearing obligation 
unless the gross notional value of all derivative contracts entered into by the non-financial 
counterparty and other non-financial entities in its “group”, excluding eligible hedging 
transactions, exceed certain thresholds and its counterparty is also subject to the clearing 
obligation. If the Fund is considered to be a member of such a “group” (as defined in EMIR) 
and if the aggregate notional value of OTC derivative contracts entered into by the Fund and 
any non-financial entities within such group exceeds the applicable thresholds, the Fund 
would be subject to the clearing obligation or if the relevant contract is not a type required to 
be cleared, to the risk mitigation obligations, including the margin posting requirement based 
on the principle that counterparties have an obligation to protect themselves against credit 
exposures to derivatives counterparties by collecting margins where those contracts are not 
cleared by a central counterparty. 
Therefore, if the Fund becomes subject to the clearing obligation or the margin requirement, it 
is unlikely that it would be able to comply with such requirements, which would adversely 
affect the Fund's ability to enter into Hedging Agreements or significantly increase the cost 
thereof, negatively affecting the Fund's ability to hedge its interest rate risk. As a result of 
such increased costs, additional regulatory requirements and limitations on ability of the Fund 
to hedge interest rate risk, the amounts payable to Noteholders may be negatively affected.  
The Hedging Agreements may contain early termination events which are based on the 
application of EMIR and which may allow the relevant Hedge Counterparty to terminate a 
Hedging Agreements upon the occurrence of such an event. The termination of a Hedging 
Agreement in these circumstances may result in a termination payment being payable by the 
Fund.

CERTAIN REGULATORY AND INDUSTRY 
DISCLOSURES 
1. 
COMPLIANCE WITH EU RISK RETENTION REQUIREMENTS 
The Seller, as an originator for the purposes of the CRR, the Regulation (EU) No. 231/2013 
of the EU Directive 2011/61/EU on Alternative Investment Fund Managers (the AIFMR) and 
the Solvency II Regulation, will retain, on an ongoing basis, a material net economic interest 
of not less than five per cent. in the securitisation contemplated by the Programme Documents 
in accordance with article 405 of the CRR (Article 405), article 51 of the AIFMR (Article 
51) and article 254 of the Solvency II Regulation (Article 254) (which, in each case, is 
interpreted and applied on the Disbursement Date and does not take into account any 
corresponding national measures) (the Retention).  
The Retention will comprise the Seller holding an interest in the first loss tranche represented 
in this case by Seller Interest Credit Facility, and any Class of Notes retained by the Seller (if 
any and as specified in the relevant Issuing Document), as required by the text of each of 
paragraph (d) of Article 405(1) of the CRR, paragraph (d) of Article 51(1) of the AIFMR and 
paragraph (d) of Article 254(2) of the Solvency II Regulation. Any change to the manner in 
which such interest is held will be notified to Noteholders. Such Retention by the Seller is 
provided by means of the Seller Interest Credit Facility and any Class of Notes retained by the 
Seller (if any). As at the first Notes Issue Disbursement Date, such Retention will be provided 
by means of the Seller Interest Credit Facility and the subscription of the Class C2017-01 
Notes. 
This Retention option and the methodology used to calculate the net economic interest will 
not change, unless such change is required due to exceptional circumstances, in which case 
such change will be appropriately disclosed to Noteholders and published on the following 
website: (www.imtitulizacion.com). In compliance with article 409 of CRR, the Seller must 
ensure that all investors can easily access all necessary data regarding credit quality and the 
evolution of underlying positions and treasury flows backing the securitisation exposures, 
together with any information necessary to carry out detailed and documented stress tests of 
the cash flows backing the underlying exposures.  
As to the information made available to prospective investors by the Fund, reference is made 
to the information set out herein and forming part of this Base Prospectus and to any other 
information provided separately (which information shall not form part of this Base 
Prospectus), including the Seller Interest Credit Facility and, after the first Notes Issue 
Disbursement Date, to the Investor Reports provided to the Noteholders and published on the 
following website: (www.imtitulizacion.com).  
The Seller will undertake to (i) the Arrangers and the relevant global coordinators, lead 
managers (including the Banco Santander and Natixis as joint lead managers in connection 
with the first Note Series issued by the Fund (the Joint Lead Managers)) or underwriters and 
(ii) the Fund, in each case, for so long as any Notes remain outstanding, that it will: 


 
45 
 
on the first Notes Issue Disbursement Date hold, and thereafter it will retain, on an 
(a)
ongoing basis, a material net economic interest of not less than five per cent. in the 
securitisation contemplated by the Programme Documents in accordance with Article 
405(1)(d) of the CRR, Article 51(1)(d) of the AIFMR taking into account Article 56 
of the AIFMR and Article 254(2)(d) of Solvency II Regulation which, in each case, is 
interpreted and applied on the first Notes Issue Disbursement Date and does not take 
into account any corresponding national measures; such retention by the Seller will 
be provided by means of the Seller Interest Credit Facility and/or any Class C Notes 
retained by the Seller (if any); this retention option and the methodology used to 
calculate the net economic interest will not change, unless such change is required 
due to exceptional circumstances and only to the extent permitted and in compliance 
with the requirements set out in CRR, the AIFMR and the Solvency II Regulation; 
 
comply with the disclosure obligations imposed on originator credit institutions under 
(b)
the CRR, the AIFMR and the Solvency II Regulation, including, but not limited to, 
by disclosing when any breach of the Retention commitment occurs or when the 
performance of the securitisation or underlying exposures materially change or 
following a breach of the agreements and documentation related to the Programme 
subject always to any requirement of law provided that the Seller will not be in 
breach of such undertaking if it fails to so comply due to events, actions or 
circumstances beyond the Seller’s control; and 
 
not sell, hedge or otherwise mitigate its credit risk under its material net economic 
(c)
interest in the securitisation as provided by means of the Seller Interest Credit Facility 
and/or any Class of Notes retained by the Seller (if any), except to the extent 
permitted by the CRR, the AIFMR and the Solvency II Regulation. 
Each prospective investor is required to independently assess and determine the sufficiency of 
the information described above and in the Base Prospectus generally for the purposes of 
complying with each of Part Five of the CRR (including Article 405), Section Five of Chapter 
III of the AIFMR (including Article 51) and Chapter VIII of Title I of the Solvency II 
Regulation (including Article 254) and any corresponding national measures which may be 
relevant and none of the Fund, the Management Company, the Seller, any global coordinator, 
lead manager (including the Joint Lead Managers), bookrunner or underwriter, the Arrangers, 
the Eligible Hedging Counterparties or any other party to the transaction makes any 
representation that the information described above or in the Base Prospectus is sufficient in 
all circumstances for such purposes. Investors who are uncertain as to the requirements which 
apply to them in respect of their relevant jurisdiction, should seek guidance from their 
regulator. 
In relation to the retention covenant to be given by the Seller to the Fund in the Seller Interest 
Credit Facility Agreement, the Master Receivables Sale and Purchase Agreement and the 
relevant Notes Subscription Agreements in accordance with the CRR, the AIFMR and the 
Solvency II Regulation regarding the material net economic interest to be retained, on an 
ongoing basis, by the Seller in the securitisation and (in respect of CRR only) certain 
requirements as to providing investor information in connection therewith, the Management 


 
46 
Company, the Arrangers, any global coordinator, lead manager (including the Joint Lead 
Managers), bookrunner or underwriter will not be under any obligation to monitor the 
compliance by the Seller with such covenant and will not be under any obligation to take any 
action in relation to non-compliance with such covenant. 
2. 
U.S. RISK RETENTION REQUIREMENTS 
The final rules implementing the credit risk retention requirements of Section 941 of the 
Dodd-Frank Act, codified by Section 15G of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as in 
effect at any time or as otherwise amended (the U.S. Risk Retention Rules), came into effect 
with respect to all asset classes on 24 December 2016 and require the "sponsor" of a 
"securitization transaction" to retain an economic interest in at least 5 per cent. of the "credit 
risk" of the "securitized assets", as such terms are defined for purposes of that statute, and 
generally prohibit a sponsor from directly or indirectly eliminating or reducing its credit 
exposure by hedging or otherwise transferring the credit risk that the sponsor is required to 
retain.  The U.S. Risk Retention Rules also provide for certain exemptions from the risk 
retention obligation that they generally impose. 
The Seller, as the sponsor under the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, does not intend to retain at 
least 5 per cent. of the credit risk of the Fund for purposes of the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, 
but rather intends to rely on an exemption provided for in Section 20 of the U.S. Risk 
Retention Rules regarding non-U.S. transactions. Such non-U.S. transactions must meet 
certain requirements, including that (1) the transaction is not required to be and is not 
registered under the Securities Act; (2) no more than 10 per cent. of the dollar value (or 
equivalent amount in the currency in which the asset-backed securities are issued) of all 
classes of asset-backed securities issued in the securitization transaction are sold or 
transferred to U.S. persons (as defined in the U.S. Risk Retention Rules and referred to in this 
Base Prospectus as Risk Retention U.S. Persons) or for the account or benefit of Risk 
Retention U.S. Persons; (3) neither the sponsor nor the issuer of the securitization transaction 
is organised under U.S. law or is a branch located in the United States of a non-U.S. entity; 
and (4) no more than 25 per cent. of the underlying collateral was acquired from a majority-
owned affiliate or branch of the sponsor or issuer organised or located in the United States. 
The Notes offered and sold by the Issuer may not be purchased by (or during the Distribution 
Compliance Period, transferred to) Risk Retention U.S. Persons.  Prospective investors should 
note that the definition of U.S. person in the U.S. Risk Retention Rules is substantially similar 
to, but not identical to, the definition of U.S. person under Regulation S, and that persons who 
are not "U.S. persons" under Regulation S may be U.S. persons under the U.S. Risk Retention 
Rules.  The definition of U.S. person in the U.S. Risk Retention Rules is excerpted below.  
Particular attention should be paid to clauses (b) and (h), which are different than comparable 
provisions from Regulation S.  
Under the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, and subject to limited exceptions, “U.S. person” (and 
"Risk Retention U.S. Person" in this Base Prospectus) means any of the following:  
 
Any natural person resident in the United States; 
(a)


 
47 
 
Any partnership, corporation, limited liability company, or other organisation or 
(b)
entity organised or incorporated under the laws of any State or of the United States;1 
 
Any estate of which any executor or administrator is a U.S. person (as defined under 
(c)
any other clause of this definition); 
 
Any trust of which any trustee is a U.S. person (as defined under any other clause of 
(d)
this definition); 
 
Any agency or branch of a foreign entity located in the United States; 
(e)
 
Any non-discretionary account or similar account (other than an estate or trust) held 
(f)
by a dealer or other fiduciary for the benefit or account of a U.S. person (as defined 
under any other clause of this definition); 
 
Any discretionary account or similar account (other than an estate or trust) held by a 
(g)
dealer or other fiduciary organised, incorporated, or (if an individual) resident in the 
United States; and 
 
Any partnership, corporation, limited liability company, or other organisation or 
(h)
entity if: 
(i) 
organised or incorporated under the laws of any foreign jurisdiction; and 
(ii) 
formed by a U.S. person (as defined under any other clause of this definition) 
principally for the purpose of investing in securities not registered under the 
Securities Act;2 
Consequently, (a) on any Issue Date, the Notes offered and sold by the Issuer may not be 
purchased by any person except for persons that are not Risk Retention U.S. Persons and (b) 
during the Distribution Compliance Period, the Notes may not be transferred to any person 
except for persons that are not Risk Retention U.S. Persons. Each holder of a Note or a 
beneficial interest therein acquired on the Issue Date or during the Distribution Compliance 
Period, by its acquisition of a Note or a beneficial interest in a Note, will be deemed, and, in 
certain circumstances will be required, to represent to the Fund, the Management Company, 
the Seller, the Arrangers, any global coordinator, lead manager (including the Joint Lead 
Managers), bookrunner or underwriter that it (1) is not a Risk Retention U.S. Person, (2) is 
acquiring such Note or a beneficial interest therein for its own account and not with a view to 
distribute such Note and (3) is not acquiring such Note or a beneficial interest therein as part 
of a scheme to evade the requirements of the U.S. Risk Retention Rules  
                                                      
1 The comparable provision from Regulation S is “(ii) any partnership or corporation organised or incorporated 
under the laws of the United States.” 
2 The comparable provision from Regulation S “(vii)(B) formed by a U.S. person principally for the purpose of 
investing in securities not registered under the Securities Act, unless it is organised or incorporated, and owned, 
by accredited investors (as defined in 17 CFR 230.501(a)) who are not natural persons, estates or trusts.” 
 


 
48 
There can be no assurance that the exemption provided for in Section 20 of the U.S. Risk 
Retention Rules regarding non-U.S. transactions will be available. No assurance can be given 
as to whether a failure by the Seller, as sponsor, to comply with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules 
(regardless of the reason for such failure to comply) may give rise to regulatory action which 
may adversely affect the Notes or their market value. Furthermore, the impact of the U.S. 
Risk Retention Rules on the securitization market generally is uncertain, and a failure by the 
Seller, as sponsor, to comply with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules could therefore negatively 
affect the market value and secondary market liquidity of the Notes. 
None of the Fund, the Management Company, the Seller, the Arrangers and lead managers 
(including the Joint Lead Managers) or any of their respective affiliates makes any 
representation to any prospective investor or purchaser of the Notes as to whether the 
transactions described in this Prospectus comply as a matter of fact with the U.S. Risk 
Retention Rules on the Closing Date or at any time in the future. Investors should consult 
their own advisers as to the U.S. Risk Retention Rules.  No predictions can be made as to the 
precise effects of such matters on any investor or otherwise

The Fund Legal Maturity Date may be extended following an amendment to the Deed of

Authorised Entity(ies)) shall correspond to the then Outstanding Principal Balances 
as defined in section 2.2 of the Additional Building Block) of the Purchased

The Reference Repurchase Price applicable to the retransfer of the Purchased 
Receivables (together with any Fund Available Cash) shall be sufficient in order to 
enable the Fund to repay in full all amounts of any nature whatsoever, due and 
payable in respect of the outstanding Rated Notes, after the payment by the Fund of 
all liabilities ranking pari passu with or in priority to those amounts in the relevant 
Accelerated Priority of Payments.

The repurchase of the Purchased Receivables remaining among the assets of the Fund 
(b)

proceeds of the Reference Repurchase Price shall be credited on the relevant 
Repurchase Date to the General Account. 
 
The Seller may acquire on its own or designate any entity to repurchase part or all the

such designated entity. 
 
Other than in the events foreseen in paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 4.4.3 above, the 
(d)
Seller shall be entitled to refuse any Offer to Retransfer made by the Management

Authorised Entity shall notify in writing their acceptance or refusal of the Offer to

(e)
Company shall offer the Purchased Receivables to (i) at least three (3) entities among 
those most active in the purchase and sale of similar assets and (ii) the Seller 
(provided no Insolvency Event has occurred in respect thereto), which all of them 
may bid concurrently and without preference amongst themselves.  
The Management Company shall set out the terms and conditions of the bidding 
process (including, without limitation, the information to be provided to the bidders 
and deadline to submit the bids) in the manner it considers best to maximise the value 
of the Purchased Receivables. 
In such case, the Management shall accept the best offer received for the Purchased 
Receivables from any of such third entities or the Seller. The Seller shall not enjoy a 
pre-emption right to match the best offer received by the Management Company. 
If no relevant offer is received from any third parties or the Seller, then the Purchased 
Receivables shall remain as assets to the Fund, without prejudice to the possibility of 
the Management Company to start a new auction process for the sale of the 
Purchased Receivables in the terms set out in this paragraph.  
 
The Management Company may obtain any appraisal reports it deems necessary from 
(f)
third-party entities in order to run the liquidation process, including any valuation 


 
56 
reports from third parties to determine the market value of the outstanding Purchased 
Receivables. 
In case of retransfer of Purchased Receivables under the conditions set out in the 
preceding paragraphs, the retransfer document shall take the form of a private 
retransfer document or, upon request from the relevant purchaser, a public deed 
(escritura or póliza) of retransfer.  
 
The Reference Repurchase Price shall be paid by Seller (or the relevant Authorised 
(g)
Entity) or the third party entity winning the auction process to the Fund in the General 
Account or the Issuer Account so designated by the Management Company. 
 
Once all the Purchased Receivables have been sold in accordance with the above, the 
(h)
Management Company will apply all the amounts that it obtains through the disposal 
of the assets of the Fund, together with the rest of the Fund Available Cash that the 
Fund might have at that time, to the payment of the different items, in the form, 
amount and in accordance with the Accelerated Priority of Payments set out in 
section 3.4.7.2 of the Additional Building Block. 
In any event, the Management Company will not proceed to extinguish the Fund and 
to cancel its registration in the corresponding administrative registries until it has 
completed the sale of the remaining assets of the Fund and the distribution of the 
Fund Available Cash in accordance with the above.   
4.4.5. Fund liquidation surplus 
Once the Fund has been liquidated and all the payments have been made pursuant to the 
Accelerated Priority of Payments set out in section 3.4.7.2 of the Additional Building Block, 
there is any remaining amount, such remaining amount will be paid to the Seller as Variable 
Fee in accordance with section 3.4.7.4 of the Additional Building Block.  
4.4.6. Extinguishment of the Fund 
The Fund will be extinguished, in any event, as a result of the following circumstances: 
 
upon full repayment of all the obligations of the Fund towards its creditors; or

BUSINESS OVERVIEW 
5.1. 
Brief description of the issuer’s main activities 
The Fund will be set up as a securitisation fund (fondo de titulización), pursuing the principal 
activities summarized below and explained in detail throughout this Base Prospectus. 


 
62 
The purpose of the Fund is to: 
 
acquire Eligible Receivables from the Seller; and 
(a)
 
finance in full the acquisition of such Eligible Receivables through the issue of the 
(b)
Note Series, the drawings under the Seller Interest Credit Facility, the Deferred 
Purchase Price and/or by allocating principal collections of Purchased Receivables.  
The proceeds from principal and interest (ordinary and accrued) of the Purchased Receivables 
received by the Fund will be allocated at the frequency set out in each Notes Series, on each 
Monthly Payment Date, to the payment of any amount that the Fund is obliged to pay, in 
accordance with the relevant Priority of Payments established in section 3.4.7.2 of the 
Additional Building Block. 
This Base Prospectus refers to the issue programme (the Programme) of Notes that are 
issued by the Fund backed by Receivables. 
The Programme will be used to arrange successive issues of Notes, arranged in Note 
Series up to the Maximum Outstanding Balance of the Programme from time to time (as 
defined in section 5.1.1 below). 
The Notes Series may be issued during the Programme Revolving Period, provided that the 
conditions established for the issue of Notes Series set out in section 4.13 of the Securities 
Note are met. 
In addition, the Fund, represented by the Management Company, will arrange for the 
provision of services in order to consolidate the financial structure of the Fund, to increase the 
security and regularity of the payment of the Notes, and, in general, to enable the financial 
transformation which takes place in the Fund between the financial characteristics of the 
Receivables and the financial characteristics of the Notes. 
5.1.1. Maximum Outstanding Balance of the Programme 
The maximum aggregate nominal amount of all Note Series from time to time outstanding 
under the Programme will not exceed EUR 2,000,000,000 (the Maximum Outstanding 
Balance of the Programme). 
Any increase of the Maximum Outstanding Balance of the Programme by the Management 
Company and the Seller may require the corresponding amendment to the Deed of 
Incorporation of the Fund with the prior consent of all the Noteholders and the other creditors 
of the Fund (excluding non-financial creditors) and a Prospectus Supplement to the Base 
Prospectus (unless such increase is made simultaneously with an annual renewal of the Base 
Prospectus). In any case, any increase of the Maximum Outstanding Balance of the 
Programme should not result in the downgrade of any outstanding Notes by the Relevant 
Rating Agencies. 


 
63 
5.1.2. Issues of Notes Series 
The Management Company may arrange for Notes Series being issued by the Fund provided 
that the Maximum Outstanding Balance of the Programme is not exceeded. 
The Fund shall be entitled to issue Note Series (i) on the Fund Incorporation Date and 
thereafter (ii) on each Issue Date until the end of the Programme Revolving Period. The Fund 
shall not issue any Note Series during the Programme Amortisation Period and the 
Programme Accelerated Amortisation Period. 
The issue of any Note Series (i) on the Fund Incorporation Date shall be subject to the 
satisfaction of the Initial Note Series Issuance Conditions Precedent as described in section 
4.13.2 of the Securities Note and (ii) on any Issue Date after the Fund Incorporation Date 
shall be subject to the satisfaction of the Further Note Series Issuance Conditions Precedent as 
described in section 4.13.3 of the Securities Note. 
Subscription or holding of Notes of one Notes Series does not imply subscription or holding 
Notes of other Notes Series. In any case, investors who purchase Notes of a given Notes 
Series will not have a right to object to the issue of Notes of additional Notes Series, and 
therefore the consent of the Noteholders of the Notes already issued will not be required. 
5.1.3. Funding Strategy of the Fund 
The funding strategy of the Fund is to issue the Note Series, the net proceeds of such Notes, 
together with the drawings under the Seller Interest Credit Facility, the Deferred Purchase 
Price and allocation of principal collections of Purchased Receivables, will be applied to (i) 
purchase from the Seller during the Programme Revolving Period, the Programme 
Amortisation Period and, if any, the Programme Accelerated Amortisation Period, portfolios 
of Eligible Receivables (as described in section 3.3 of the Additional Building Block) and/or 
(ii) to redeem existing Note Series and/or (iii) to repay the Seller Interest Credit Facility 
and/or the Aggregate Deferred Purchase Price.  
5.1.4. Hedging Strategy of the Fund 
If the Notes of any Note Series are Floating Rate Notes and unless such Floating Rate Notes 
have a Maximum Interest Rate, the Fund will enter into one or several Hedging Agreements 
with one or several Eligible Hedging Counterparty(ies) in order to hedge its exposure with 
respect to any Floating Rate Notes of any Note Series against the fixed interest rate of the 
Purchased Receivables. Additional details on the hedging strategy of the Fund are included in 
section 3.4.8 of the Additional Building Block. 
5.1.5. Cross-collateralisation 
Each Note Series will be collateralised by the whole portfolio of outstanding Purchased 
Receivables (the Securitised Portfolio) which have been purchased by the Fund on each 
Purchase Date pursuant to the terms of the Master Receivables Sale and Purchase Agreement.  


 
64 
Each Note of each Note Series will have recourse and receive payments from the Purchased 
Receivables as a whole (subject to the then applicable Priority of Payments) irrespective of 
their respective Issue Dates, Scheduled Amortisation Starting Dates and Notes Final Legal 
Maturity Dates of the relevant Note Series. 
No compartment will be created in the Fund to back any specific Note Series.

4.2. 
Description of the type and class of the Notes 
4.2.1. Type and class of the Notes 
The Notes are asset-backed notes that represent a debt of the Fund, accrue interest and are 
redeemable on each Payment Date during their applicable Note Series Amortisation Period. 
The Notes legally qualify as marketable fixed income securities with an explicit yield and are 
subject to the provisions of the Legislative Royal Decree 4/2015, dated 23 October, approving 
the consolidated text of the Securities Market Law (Real Decreto Legislativo 4/2015, de 23 de 
octubre, por el que se aprueba el texto refundido de la Ley del Mercado de Valores) (the 
Legislative Royal Decree 4/2015) and its development regulations and are issued pursuant to 
Law 5/2015. 
Notes issued by the Fund under the Programme are issued in Notes Series. A Note Series 
shall be comprised by the following classes of Notes (each a Class): 
 
Class A notes (the Class A Notes); and 
(a)
 
Class C notes (the Class C Notes).  
(b)
Additionally, a Note Series may also include Class B notes (the Class B Notes).  
Upon issue, no Note Series shall be composed by a single Class of Notes or a combination of 
(i) Class B Notes and Class C Notes or (ii) Class A Notes and Class B Notes, exclusively. 
All Notes of a particular Class of Notes of a Notes Series shall have the same interest rate, 
Scheduled Amortisation Starting Date and Notes Final Legal Maturity Date. Interest 
calculation may differ between Classes of Notes. 
However, a Class of Notes of a specific Note Series will not necessarily be subject to identical 
terms in all respects as those of the same Class of Notes of a different Note Series.  
Please see section 7.5 of the Securities Note with respect to the ratings of the Notes of each 
Notes Series.  


 
 
80 
 
4.2.2. Currency 
The Notes of any Note Series will be always denominated in EUR.  
4.2.3. Interest (fixed/floating) 
Each Class of Notes of any Note Series may bear a fixed interest rate or a floating interest (as 
specified in the relevant Issuing Document). 
In the case of each Class of Notes of any Note Series bearing a floating interest rate as 
specified in the relevant Issuing Document for that particular Note Series, and unless such 
floating rate notes have a Maximum Interest Rate (as defined in section 4.8.3 below), a 
separate hedging transaction will be entered into by the Fund to convert the fixed amounts 
received by the Fund as applicable floating amounts for payments in respect of that Note 
Series. 
4.2.4. Issue of Note Series 
So long as:  
 
the Initial Note Series Issuance Conditions Precedent set out in section 4.13.2 of the 
(a)
Securities Note have been satisfied, the Fund may issue, upon decision of the Seller, 
one or several Note Series on the Fund Incorporation Date; and  
 
the Further Note Series Issuance Conditions Precedent set out in section 4.13.3 of the 
(b)
Securities Note have been satisfied, the Fund may issue, upon decision of the Seller, 
additional Note Series on each Issue Date until the end of the Programme Revolving 
Period. The Fund is not required to permit any prior review by or to obtain the 
consent of any Noteholder of any outstanding Note Series to issue any additional 
Note Series. 
4.2.5. Issuing Document 
Each Note Series will be the subject of the corresponding Issuing Document. The terms and 
conditions applicable to any particular Note Series shall be described in the corresponding 
Issuing Document. 
4.2.6. Representation and denomination of the Notes  
The Notes of any Note Series will be issued in book-entry form or registered titles in the 
denomination of EUR 100,000 each.  
The Notes of each Notes Series may be unlisted or listed on AIAF, MARF or any other 
regulated or unregulated market. Consequently,  
 
within a Note Series it is possible that certain Classes of Notes are listed in the above 
(a)
mentioned markets whilst other are not;  


 
 
81 
 
 
within the same Class of Notes (across different Note Series) it is possible to have 
(b)
Notes which may be unlisted or listed in the above mentioned markets; and 
 
Notes of a given Class within a Notes Series must be either listed or unlisted (but not 
(c)
both simultaneously).  
Where applicable, the Management Company, acting for and on behalf of the Fund, will 
request the inclusion of the listed Class of Notes of a Notes Series issued under the 
Programme in IBERCLEAR. 
The information about the ISIN (International Securities Identification Number) of each of 
the Notes of the corresponding Notes Series under this Programme will be set out in the 
Issuing Document of the corresponding Notes Series (if applicable). 
4.2.7. Note Series and Notes 
All Class A Notes, all Class B Notes (if any) and all Class C Notes issued on the same Issue 
Date will constitute a Note Series, which shall be designated by means of: 
 
a four digit number representing the year on which the Note Series was issued, in the 
(a)
following format: Note Series “20xx”; followed by 
 
the number of such Note Series in respect of the relevant year, in the following 
(b)
format: “yy”. 
Consequently, each Note Series will present in the following format: Note Series 20xx-yy. 
All Notes of the same Class and Note Series shall have the exact same characteristics and 
therefore be fungible amongst themselves. 
The Class A Notes, Class B Notes and Class C Notes of any Note Series should present in the 
following format: Class A20xx-yy Notes, Class B20xx-yy Notes and Class C20xx-yy Notes, 
respectively. 
The Class A20xx-yy Notes, the Class B20xx-yy Notes and Class C20xx-yy Notes of a given 
Note Series shall have: 
 
the same Interest Period and the same Payment Date (as defined in section 4.8.2 of 
(a)
this Securities Note).  
 
the same Scheduled Amortisation Starting Date which shall be specified in the 
(b)
applicable Issuing Document. A Note Series 20xx-yy Call Date may be a Scheduled 
Amortisation Starting Date, provided that:  
(i) 
In accordance with section 4.9.5 of the Securities Note, the election by the 
Fund, represented by the Management Company and following a Seller's 
Optional Early Redemption Written Instruction to exercise the (i) optional

redemption of the relevant Note Series on the applicable Note Series 20xx-yy 
Clean-Up Call Date or (ii) the optional redemption of the relevant Note Series 
on the Note Series 20xx-yy Call Date specified in the applicable Issuing 
Document shall constitute an Optional Early Redemption Event. 
(ii) 
If one or several Note Series 20xx-yy Call Date(s) are specified in the 
relevant Issuing Document, the Class A20xx-yy Notes, the Class B20xx-yy 
Notes and Class C20xx-yy Notes in respect of such given Note Series shall 
have the same Note Series 20xx-yy Call Date(s).  
(iii) 
The Management Company, on behalf of the Fund, will (if directed to do so 
by the Seller), on the Payment Date and on any subsequent Payment Date on 
which the Note Series 20xx-yy Clean-Up Call Condition is satisfied (the 
Note Series 20xx-yy Clean-Up Call Date), redeem any outstanding Note 
Series in an amount equal to the applicable Note Series 20xx-yy Clean-Up 
Call Amount.  
 
the same Notes Final Legal Maturity Date, which shall be specified in the applicable

of the Notes in each Notes Series will be designated in the corresponding Issuing Document. 
In addition, a billing and delivery agent (responsible for the delivery of the Notes to the

In particular, Banco Santander and Natixis will act as Global Coordinators and Joint Lead

SFC or any entity designated by SFC shall be entitled to (and may reserve the right to) 
subscribe in full or in part any Notes of a Note Series issued by the Fund.  
The holding or subscription of one of the classes of Notes of a Notes Series does not 
necessarily imply the holding of subscription of the Notes of the other classes of Notes of 
such Notes Series. 
4.4. 
Legislation under which the Notes have been created 
The Fund is incorporated and the Notes will be issued in accordance with the Spanish laws 
applicable to them and, in particular, with (i) the Legislative Royal Decree 4/2015; (ii) Law 
5/2015; (iii) Royal Decree 1310/2015; (iv) Order EHA/3537/2005; (iv) Royal Decree 
116/1992; (v) Royal Decree 878/2015 and (vi) any other legal and regulatory provisions in 
force that apply from time to time. 
In accordance with the Seventh Final Provision of Royal Decree 878/2015, the Royal Decree 
878/2015 entered into force on 3 February 2016, thus replacing Royal Decree 116/1992. 
However, the Second Additional Provision of Royal Decree 878/2015 provides that the 
amendments introduced therein will not be applicable to fixed-income securities admitted to 
trading in regulated markets (mercados secundarios oficiales) (such as the Notes), until such 
date and within the terms to be determined by the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness 
(such date is expected to be around September 2017).

Determination of Interest Rate and calculation of the Class A20xx-yy Notes Interest 
(a)
Amount, the Class B20xx-yy Notes Interest Amount and the Class C20xx-yy Notes 
Interest Amount for the Floating Rate Notes 
On each Interest Determination Date the Management Company shall determine the 
Interest Rate applicable to the Notes of any Note Series for the relevant Interest 
Period. 


 
 
97 
 
 
Interest Rate for Floating Rate Notes 
(b)
The Interest Rate in respect of Floating Rate Notes of any Note Series for each 
Interest Period will be the result of adding the Relevant Margin (or the Step-Up 
Margin) to the Reference Rate and shall be determined in the manner specified in the 
relevant Issuing Document; the provisions below relating to Reference Rate 
determination shall apply.  
For this purpose Reference Rate shall be (i) during the Programme Revolving Period 
and the Programme Amortisation Period either the EURIBOR for one (1) month, or 
the EURIBOR for three (3) months, or the EURIBOR for six (6) months or the 
EURIBOR for twelve (12) months, as specified in the relevant Issuing Document and 
(ii) during the Programme Accelerated Amortisation Period, EURIBOR for one (1) 
month. 
The Reference Rate for each Interest Period will, subject as provided below, be:  
(i) 
the Reference Rate which appears on the Relevant Screen Page as at 11.00 
a.m. (Brussels time) (or, with respect to the first Interest Period, the rate 
which represents the linear interpolation of the relevant EURIBOR rates for 
such period as specified in the relevant Issuing Document) on the Interest 
Determination Date in question as notified by the Paying Agent to the 
Management Company;  
(ii) 
if the Relevant Screen Page is not available as at the time specified above, 
then the rate for any relevant period shall be the arithmetic mean (rounded to 
four decimal places with the mid-point rounded upwards) of the offered 
quotations (expressed as a percentage rate per annum) notified to the Paying 
Agent at its request by each of the principal Euro-zone office of each of the 
Reference Banks as the rate at which euro deposits in respect of the relevant 
period in a representative amount are offered by the Reference Bank to 
leading banks in the euro-zone interbank for the Reference Rate at 
approximately 11.00 a.m. (Brussels time) on the Interest Determination Date 
in question; and 
(iii) 
if, at the time, the Reference Rate is unavailable and only two of the 
Reference Banks provide such quoted rate to the Paying Agent, the relevant 
rate will be determined on the basis of the average quoted rate of such two 
Reference Banks able to provide such quotations; or  
(iv) 
if, at the time, the Reference Rate is unavailable and only one or none of the 
Reference Banks provides the Paying Agent with such quoted rate, the rate in 
effect for the immediately preceding Interest Period will apply or in the 
absence of such, the immediately preceding Business Day where such 
Reference Rate is available. 


 
 
98 
 
The Paying Agent shall communicate to the Management Company by email, before 
13:00 CET of the Interest Determination Date, the Reference Rate including the 
supporting documentation for such calculations. 
 
Relevant Margin and Step-up Margin 
(c)
The Relevant Margin and, as applicable, the Step-up Margin for the Floating Rate 
Notes shall be specified in the applicable Issuing Document. 
 
Rounding 
(d)
For the purposes of any calculations required, (x) all percentages resulting from such 
calculations shall be rounded (if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of 
a percentage point, 0.000005 being rounded upwards), (y) all figures shall be rounded 
to seven significant figures (with halves being rounded up) and (z) all EUR amounts 
that fall due and payable shall be rounded to the nearest lowest amount of EUR that is 
available as legal tender (with halves being rounded up).  
 
Capped or floored Euribor  
(e)
If any Notes of any Note Series are Floating Rate Notes, the applicable EURIBOR 
may be capped or floored at a certain level which shall be specified in the applicable 
Issuing Document.  
 
Floor Interest Rate 
(f)
The Interest Rate accrued by the Notes of any Notes Series during each Interest 
Period will be for any Floating Rate the maximum between zero percent (0%) and the 
result of adding (a) the Reference Rate (rounded in accordance with the provisions 
above); and (b) the Relevant Margin or the relevant Step-up Margin (as the case may 
be).  
 
Calculations 
(g)
The amount of interest payable in respect of any Floating Rate Note of any Note 
Series for any period shall be calculated by multiplying the product of the Interest 
Rate and the Principal Amount Outstanding of such Note by the Day Count Fraction. 
 
Notification of the Notes Interest Amount 
(h)
The Management Company shall notify the Class A20xx-yy Notes Interest Amount, 
the Class B20xx-yy Notes Interest Amount and the Class C20xx-yy Notes Interest 
Amount of any Note Series applicable for the relevant Interest Period to the Paying 
Agent at least one (1) Business Day prior to each Payment Date (or such other date as 
agreed between the Management Company and the Paying Agent from time to time).

(i)
All notifications, certificates, communications, opinions, determinations, calculations, 
quotations and decisions given, expressed, made or obtained for the purpose of the 
provisions of this section whether by the Reference Banks (or any of them) or the 
Management Company shall (in the absence of willful default (dolo), bad faith (mala 
fe) or manifest error (error manifesto)) be binding on the Management Company, the 
Fund, the Reference Banks, the Paying Agent and all Note Series Noteholders. 
 
Reference Banks 
(j)
Reference Banks means the three (3) major banks in the euro-zone inter-bank market 
selected by the Paying Agent from time to time and if any such bank is unable or 
unwilling to continue to act, such other bank as may be selected by the Paying Agent 
on behalf of the Fund to act in its place.  
4.8.7. Step-up Interest Rate and Step-up Margin 
 
Step-up Interest Rate 
(a)
Fixed Rate Notes of any Note Series may bear a step-up interest rate (if and as 
specified in the applicable Issuing Document) if such Fixed Rate Notes are not fully 
redeemed on the applicable Note Series 20xx-yy Call Date (if a Note Series 20xx-yy 
Call Date is specified in the applicable Issuing Document) (the Step-up Interest 
Rate).  
Such Step-up Interest Rate will be applicable after such date and shall replace the 
Interest Rate. 
The Step-up Interest Rate shall be specified in the applicable Issuing Document. 
 
Step-up Margin 
(b)
A step-up margin (if and as specified in the applicable Issuing Document) will apply 
to Floating Rate Notes of any Note Series if such Floating Rate Notes are not fully 
redeemed on the applicable Note Series 20xx-yy Call Date (if such Note Series 20xx-
yy Call Date is specified in the applicable Issuing Document) (the Step-up Margin).  
The Step-up Margin will be applicable after such date and shall replace the Relevant 
Margin. 
The Step-up Margin shall be specified in the applicable Issuing Document.

4.8.8. Payments under the Notes 
4.8.8.1. 
General  
Payments of principal and interest (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any arrears of 
interest, where applicable) in respect of the Notes of any Note Series in accordance with the 
Priority of Payments set out in section 3.4.7.2 of the Additional Building Block will be made:  
 
in case of listed Notes, by transfer to the account of the relevant participants in 
(a)
IBERCLEAR to distribute the corresponding amounts to the relevant Note Series 
Noteholders. The payment will be made through the Paying Agent, using 
IBERCLEAR and its participative entities to distribute the corresponding amounts.  
 
in case of unlisted Notes in book-entry form, by transfer to the account duly notified 
(b)
by the Noteholder to the duly licensed financial institution appointed by the 
Management Company to manage such registry, for such purposes. The payment will 
be made through the Paying Agent. 
 
in case of unlisted Notes in registered form, by transfer to the account duly notified 
(c)
by the Noteholder to the Management Company for such purposes. The payment will 
be made through the Paying Agent.  
The Fund, acting through the Management Company, will not postpone the payment of 
interest (or principal) of the Notes later than the Fund Legal Maturity Date.  
Payments in respect of principal and interest on the Notes will, in all cases, be made subject to 
any tax or other laws and regulations applicable thereto. No fees or expenses shall be charged 
to the Note Series Noteholders in respect of such payments. Payments of principal and 
interest in respect of the Notes shall be made net of any withholding tax (if any) applicable to 
the Notes of any Note Series in the relevant state or jurisdiction, and neither the Fund, the 
Management Company, any Eligible Hedging Counterparties or the Paying Agent shall be 
under any obligation to gross up such amounts as a consequence or otherwise compensate the 
Noteholders for the lesser amounts the Noteholders will receive as a result of such 
withholding or deduction. Any such imposition of withholding taxes will result in the 
Noteholders receiving a lesser amount in respect of the payments on the Notes. The ratings to 
be assigned by the Relevant Rating Agencies to the Rated Notes will not address the 
likelihood of the imposition of withholding taxes.  
Any current or future withholdings, rates and taxes to which the capital, interest or yields of 
the Notes are subject will be exclusively assumed by the Noteholders and, where applicable, 
their corresponding amount will be deducted by the entity obliged to do so in the legally 
established manner. 


 
 
101 
 
4.8.8.2. 
Payment Dates  
Further to section 4.8.2 por encima de, Note Series may have an Annual Payment Date, a 
Semi-Annual Payment Date, a Quarterly Payment Date, or a Monthly Payment Date (as 
specified in the applicable Issuing Document).  
If the Payment Date of any amount of principal or interest in respect of any Note is not a 
Business Day, the Modified Following Business Day Convention shall apply (ie. payment 
shall not be made of the amount due and credit or transfer instructions shall not be given in 
respect thereof until the next following Business Day unless such Business Day falls in the 
next calendar month in which case such Payment Date shall be brought forward to the 
immediately preceding Business Day). If any payment is postponed as a result of the 
foregoing, the Note Series Noteholders shall not be entitled to any interest or other sums in 
respect of such postponed payment.  
4.8.8.3. 
Interest Distribution Ledger and Principal Distribution Ledger 
During the Programme Revolving Period and the Programme Amortisation Period, in order to 
treat equally Note Series which Payment Date occurs annually, semi-annually and quarterly 
(the Relevant Note Series) with Note Series which Payment Date occurs monthly for the 
payment of the interest and principal amounts due to the relevant Note Series Noteholders 
and/or the relevant Hedging Counterparties by the Fund, the Management Company shall 
establish, with respect to such Relevant Note Series, two (2) ledgers (one ledger with respect 
to the Principal Account and one ledger with respect to the Interest Account) on which will be 
recorded on each Monthly Payment Date (which is not a Payment Date for such Relevant 
Note Series) the monthly share of the interest and principal amounts that will be due and 
payable by the Fund to the relevant Note Series Noteholders and the relevant Hedging 
Counterparties on the relevant Payment Date of such Relevant Note Series. 
For the avoidance of doubt, no retention shall be made: 
 
in respect of the Note Series which have a Monthly Payment Date (as specified in the 
(a)
applicable Issuing Document); 
 
in respect of all Relevant Note Series: 
(b)
(i) 
during the Programme Revolving Period and the Programme Amortisation 
Period, on the Monthly Payment Date which is a Payment Date for such 
Relevant Note Series; and 
(ii) 
during the Programme Accelerated Amortisation Period. 
Such amounts to be retained on each applicable Monthly Payment Date shall be calculated by 
the Management Company on a Class by Class basis for each Relevant Note Series and shall 
be recorded on the relevant ledger in accordance with the applicable Interest Priority of 
Payments and Principal Priority of Payments. The aggregate amounts retained under a 


 
 
102 
 
particular Class of Notes of a Relevant Note Series will be then allocated by the Management 
Company on the applicable Payment Date (together with the monthly share due on such 
Payment Date). 
 
Interest Distribution Ledger 
(a)
An interest distribution ledger (the Interest Distribution Ledger) shall be associated 
with the Interest Account and shall be established on the Fund Incorporation Date by 
the Management Company in order to record any amount which is retained on the 
Interest Account on any Monthly Payment Date (which is not a Payment Date for the 
considered Relevant Note Series) in accordance with the applicable Interest Priority 
of Payments. 
On each applicable Monthly Payment Date (which is not a Payment Date for the 
considered Relevant Note Series), the Interest Distribution Ledger will record the 
relevant Monthly Interest Amount and/or the Monthly Hedging Net Amounts which 
are retained in respect of the Relevant Note Series (on a Class by Class basis) on the 
Interest Account on such Monthly Payment Date. 
 
Principal Distribution Ledger 
(b)
A principal distribution ledger (the Principal Distribution Ledger) shall be 
associated with the Principal Account and shall be established on the Fund 
Incorporation Date by the Management Company in order to record any amount 
which is retained on the Principal Account on any Monthly Payment Date (which is 
not a Payment Date for the considered Relevant Note Series) in accordance with the 
applicable Principal Priority of Payments. 
On each applicable Monthly Payment Date (which is not a Payment Date for the 
considered Relevant Note Series), the Principal Distribution Ledger will record the 
relevant Monthly Amortisation Amount which is retained in respect of the Relevant 
Note Series (on a Class by Class basis) on the Principal Account on such Monthly 
Payment Date. 
 
Calculation of amounts to be retained or allocated 
(c)
With respect to each Relevant Note Series, the Management Company shall calculate: 
(i) 
in respect of interest amounts: 
(A) 
on each Monthly Payment Date which is not a Payment Date for the 
considered Relevant Note Series, the relevant Class A20xx-yy Notes 
Monthly Interest Amount, the Class B20xx-yy Notes Monthly 
Interest Amount and the Class C20xx-yy Notes Monthly Interest 
Amount) and/or the Monthly Hedging Net Amounts (including the 
Class A20xx-yy Monthly Hedging Net Amount, the Class B20xx-yy 


 
 
103 
 
Monthly Hedging Net Amount and the Class C20xx-yy Monthly 
Hedging Net Amount) to be retained on the Interest Account during 
the relevant quarterly, semi-annual and annual period, and credited to 
the Interest Distribution Ledger; and 
(B) 
on each Monthly Payment Date which is a Payment Date for the 
considered Relevant Note Series, the relevant Class A20xx-yy Notes 
Monthly Interest Amount, Class B20xx-yy Notes Monthly Interest 
Amount, Class C20xx-yy Notes Monthly Interest Amount, Class 
A20xx-yy Monthly Hedging Net Amount, Class B20xx-yy Monthly 
Hedging Net Amount and Class C20xx-yy Monthly Hedging Net 
Amount to be debited from the Interest Account (taking into account 
for the avoidance of doubt the relevant amounts retained on the 
Interest Distribution Ledger since the last Payment Date in 
accordance with paragraph (A) above and which shall be debited 
from the Interest Distribution Ledger on such Monthly Payment 
Date); 
(ii) 
in respect of principal amount: 
(A) 
on each Monthly Payment Date which is not a Payment Date for the 
considered Relevant Note Series, the relevant Class A20xx-yy Notes 
Monthly Amortisation Amount, Class B20xx-yy Notes Monthly 
Amortisation Amount and Class C20xx-yy Notes Monthly 
Amortisation Amount to be retained on the Principal Account and 
credited to the Principal Distribution Ledger; and

considered Relevant Note Series the relevant Class A20xx-yy Notes 
Monthly Amortisation Amount, Class B20xx-yy Notes Monthly 
Amortisation Amount and Class C20xx-yy Notes Monthly 
Amortisation Amount to be debited from the Principal Account 
(taking into account, for the avoidance of doubt, the relevant amounts 
retained on Principal Distribution Ledger since the last Payment Date 
in accordance with paragraph (A) above and which shall debited 
from the Principal Distribution Ledger). 
For these purposes Calculation Date means the fifth (5th) Business Day 
before each Monthly Payment Date. For clarification purposes, the first 
Calculation Date after the Fund Incorporation Date will be 19 June 2017. 
 
Retention and allocation 
(d)
Any amount credited on the Interest Distribution Ledger and the Principal 
Distribution Ledger, respectively, with respect to the relevant Class of Notes of any 
Relevant Note Series shall be retained on the Interest Account and the Principal 


 
 
104 
 
Account until the applicable Payment Date of such Relevant Note Series for 
allocation by the Management Company to the relevant Note Series Noteholders or to 
the relevant Hedging Counterparty and shall not be allocated for any other Note 
Series. 
If any Accelerated Amortisation Event has occurred, any amounts recorded on the 
Interest Distribution Ledger and the Principal Distribution Ledger, respectively, with 
respect to each relevant Class of Notes of the Relevant Note Series on the preceding 
Monthly Payment Dates since the last Payment Date shall be exclusively allocated on 
the first Monthly Payment Date following the date on which an Accelerated 
Amortisation Event has occurred to the payments to be made in respect of such 
relevant Class of Notes (and to no other Class of Notes and/or Note Series). 
During the Programme Accelerated Amortisation Period, no retention shall be made 
and the Interest Distribution Ledger and the Principal Distribution Ledger shall not be 
maintained. 
 
Instructions from the Management Company 
(e)
Upon calculation of any amounts to be retained on or, as applicable, to be debited 
from, the Interest Account (and, as the case may be, the Interest Distribution Ledger) 
and the Principal Account (and, as the case may be, the Principal Distribution 
Ledger), respectively, the Management Company shall give the necessary instructions 
to the Issuer Accounts Bank taking into account any amount to be retained and any 
amount to be allocated after retention on any applicable Monthly Payment Date. 
 
Insufficient or excess amounts of interest and/or hedging 
(f)
The retention shall be made subject to the funds available on a Monthly Payment 
Date. If, on any applicable Monthly Payment Date (which is not a Payment Date with 
respect to the Class of Note of a Relevant Note Series), the interest and/or hedging 
amounts recorded on the Interest Distribution Ledger and retained until the next 
applicable Payment Dates with respect to the Class of Note of a Relevant Note Series 
are less than amounts calculated by the Management Company with respect to such 
Monthly Payment Date for retention purposes, the Management Company shall 
calculate the relevant interest and/or hedging retention shortfall on a Class by Class 
basis (ie, the Class A20xx-yy Notes Monthly Interest Shortfall, the Class B20xx-yy 
Notes Monthly Interest Shortfall, the Class C20xx-yy Notes Monthly Interest 
Shortfall, the Class A20xx-yy Monthly Hedging Net Shortfall, the Class B20xx-yy 
Monthly Hedging Net Shortfall and the Class C20xx-yy Monthly Hedging Net 
Shortfall). 
Any Class A20xx-yy Note Monthly Interest Shortfall, Class B20xx-yy Note Monthly 
Interest Shortfall, Class C20xx-yy Note Monthly Interest Shortfall, Class A20xx-yy 
Monthly Hedging Net Shortfall, Class B20xx-yy Monthly Hedging Net Shortfall or 
Class C20xx-yy Monthly Hedging Net Shortfall shall be added to the amounts to be 


 
 
105 
 
(i) retained on the Interest Account on the next Monthly Payment Date(s) up to the 
next Payment Date (excluded) or (ii) allocated on the next Monthly Payment Date 
which is a Payment Date for such Note Series. 
For the avoidance of doubt, failure to cure any interest and/or hedging retention 
shortfall on the next Monthly Payment Date(s) (up to the applicable Payment Date 
(excluded)) shall not trigger, as such, any acceleration or event of default under the 
Notes. Any interest and/or hedging retention shortfall which has not been cured on 
the applicable Payment Date shall, on such Payment Date, constitute an arrear and, if 
such arrear affects the Class A Notes of any Note Series or, if the Class A Notes of all 
Note Series have been redeemed in full, the Class B Notes of any Note Series, it shall 
be an Accelerated Amortisation Event pursuant to paragraph (b)(i) of section 3.1.3 of 
the Additional Building Block (subject to any applicable remedy period).  
If, on any Payment Date, the Management Company determines that there is an 
excess of interest and/or hedging amounts recorded to the Interest Distribution Ledger 
in respect of a specific Class of Notes of a Relevant Note Series, the Management 
Company shall debit the Interest Distribution Ledger in the amount of such excess on 
such Payment Date and such excess shall constitute Available Interest Amount that 
can be used by the Fund for payment of interest and/or hedging amounts due under 
other Note Series. 
4.8.8.4. 
Distributions 
On each Monthly Payment Date during the Programme Revolving Period and the Programme 
Amortisation Period, the Available Interest Amount and the Available Principal Amount, 
together with the General Reserve under certain conditions, shall be applied in making the 
payments referred to in the Interest Priority of Payments and Principal Priority of Payments. 
Prior to each Monthly Payment Date, the Management Company shall make the relevant 
calculations and determinations in connection with each Priority of Payments. 
On each Monthly Payment Date during the Programme Accelerated Amortisation Period, the 
Available Distribution Amount shall be applied in making the payments referred to in the 
Accelerated Priority of Payments. 
4.8.9. Calculation Agent 
The calculation agent in respect of the Notes shall be the Management Company. 
4.9. 
Maturity Date and redemption of the securities

Document and subject to the relevant Modified Following Business Day Convention) in 
accordance with the applicable Priority of Payments (the Notes Final Legal Maturity Date).  
Any part of the nominal value of any Class of Notes of any Note Series or of the interest due 
on thereon which may remain unpaid shall be automatically cancelled after the applicable

4.10. 
Indication of the yield  
No assurance can be made of the amount of payments that will be made on the Notes on each 
Payment Date because that amount will depend on the amount of payments received on the 
Receivables during the preceding Collection Period.  
The average life, duration, yield to maturity, term, estimated maturity date, and any other 
metric of the Notes in general cannot be predicted with any certainty, as a number of other 


 
 
123 
 
factors on which they rely are unknown. The most significant unknown factors upon which 
payment of the Notes depend are (i) collections under the Receivables and changes in the 
receivables payment terms, (ii) change of Notes Series Interest Rate (if Floating Interest Rate 
Note Series), (iii) capacity of the Borrowers to prepay, in full or in part, the Receivables, (iv) 
payment rate of the Receivables, (v) availability of Receivables eligible for purchase, (vi) the 
default rates of the Borrowers, (vii) the exercise by the Seller of any early redemption option, 
and (viii) the occurrence of an Early Liquidation Event, a Revolving Termination Event or an 
Accelerated Amortisation Event.  
Notwithstanding the above, estimations of the actual interest and principal payable to a 
subscriber who acquires the Notes of a Notes Series, will be indicated by way of example in 
the corresponding Issuing Document, along with estimations of the average life, yield to 
maturity, duration, and estimated maturity date of such Notes which will be calculated using 
certain information, hypothesis and assumptions, amongst others:  
 
the Disbursement Date of the Note Series 20xx-yy; 
(a)
 
the Scheduled Amortisation Starting Date; 
(b)
 
for the purposes of this section the cut-off date will be specified , as the Fund relevant 
(c)
Cut-Off Date prior to the issuance of such Notes (with explicit indication of such 
date), except for the Notes issued on the Fund Incorporation Date which will be the 
15th March 2017 corresponding to the reference date of the Audited Portfolio; 
 
that on the Disbursement Date of the Note Series 20xx-yy, the Outstanding Principal 
(d)
Balances of the Purchased Receivables is equal to the Minimum Portfolio Amount as 
of such date. New Receivables are purchased (if required) in order to maintain such 
Minimum Portfolio Amount until the Scheduled Amortisation Starting Date of the 
Note Series 20xx-yy; 
 
that the composition and the amortisation profile of the portfolio of the Purchased 
(e)
Receivables (and the new Receivables purchased during the Note Series Revolving 
Period of the outstanding Note Series) is similar to the composition and amortisation 
profile of the performing portfolio as at the cut-off date prior to the issuance of such 
Notes; 
 
no new issuance of further Note Series occurs (however for calculation purposes, 
(f)
previously issued and outstanding Notes Series are considered); 
 
the Seller does not repurchase any Receivables purchased by the Fund; 
(g)
 
the rate of defaults on the Receivables will be specified in the corresponding Issuing 
(h)
Document; 


 
 
124 
 
 
interest payments on the Receivables will be received, if any at the applicable interest 
(i)
rate offered by SFC as the cut-off date. No adjustment of the applicable interest rate 
under the Revolving Credit Agreements is offered by SFC; 
 
the Fund excess margin remains sufficient to cover all defaulted amounts; 
(j)
 
principal payments and prepayments on the Receivables will be received, if any, at 
(k)
the relevant constant monthly principal payment rate (the MPPR) specified in the 
corresponding Issuing Document; 
 
the calculation of the weighted average life (in years) is calculated on 
(l)
an Actual/Actual basis; 
 
the Note Series 20xx-yy Clean-Up Call Conditions will not be considered applicable;  
(m)
 
none of the Fund Liquidation Events are considered applicable; 
(n)
 
payment of principal and interest due and payable under the Notes will be received on 
(o)
the 26th day of each relevant Note Series Payment Date;  
 
zero per cent investment return is earned on the Issuer Accounts; 
(p)
 
no Revolving Termination Event has occurred; 
(q)
 
no Accelerated Amortisation Event has occurred;  
(r)
 
it is not necessary to use the Commingling Reserve or the General Reserve. 
(s)
These estimates will have certain inherent limitations. No representations will be made that 
such estimates are accurate, that all assumptions relating to such estimates have been 
considered or stated or that such estimates will be realised.

5.1. 
Market where the securities will be traded 
The Notes may be unlisted or listed on AIAF, MARF or any other regulated or unregulated 
market. There is no obligation for the Notes of all Notes Series to be listed on any markets. 
Where the Notes are to be listed on AIAF, MARF or any other regulated or unregulated

admission to trading of the Notes of each Notes Series on any such market is carried out not 
later than thirty (30) calendar days after the corresponding Disbursement Date set out in the 
corresponding Issuing Document. The Management Company will also, on behalf of the 
Fund, request the inclusion of the listed Notes of each Notes Series in IBERCLEAR so that 
clearing and settlement may be carried out under the operating rules established or that may 
be approved in the future by IBERCLEAR with regard to the securities admitted to trading on 
the on AIAF, MARF or any other regulated or unregulated market and represented by book 
entries.  
The Management Company shall carry out its best efforts in order that each listed Notes 
Series is included in the registries of IBERCLEAR. 
In the event of a failure to meet the deadline for the admission of the listed Notes of any 
Notes Series to trading, the Management Company undertakes to report a relevant fact (hecho 
relevante) to the CNMV and make the announcement in the corresponding mean foreseen in 
in AIAF, MARF or the corresponding regulated or unregulated market or in any other media 
generally accepted by the market which guarantees adequate dissemination of the 
information, in time and content, concerning the reasons for such breach and the new date for 
admission of the issued securities to trading, without prejudice of the possible liability of the 
Management Company if the breach is due to reasons attributable thereto. 
The Management Company, in the name and on behalf of the Fund, represents that it is aware 
of the requirements and conditions that may be requested for the listing, maintenance and de-
listing of the securities with AIAF, MARF or any other regulated or unregulated market, in 
accordance with the applicable regulation, as well as the requirements by the governing 
bodies of the latter, and the Management Company accepts to comply with them.  
It is not foreseen to enter into any agreement with an entity that will undertake to facilitate the 
liquidity of the Notes during the life of the Fund.  
Where the Notes are not listed in any market, the Management Company shall comply with 
the provisions set out in section 4.5.1 of the Securities Note.  


 
 
142 
 
5.1.1. Special provisions in relation to the admission to listing in MARF

securities in the Alternative Fixed-Income Market (Circular 1/2015, de 30 de septiembre, 
sobre Incorporación y Exclusión de Valores en el Mercado Alternativo De Renta Fija) or any 
regulation amending or substituting it from time to time. 
For such purposes, the Management Company shall file the relevant application and any 
required documentation to ensure that all the requirements for admission to the MARF are 
complied with. In addition, the Management Company will act as registered advisor (asesor 
registrado). 
5.2. 
Paying Agent 
The Management Company, acting for and on behalf of the Fund, appoints Banco Santander 
as Paying Agent in order to carry out certain financial services (paying agency) in relation to 
the Notes of each Note Series issued by the Fund with effects from the Fund Incorporation 
Date. 
5.2.1. Obligations of the Paying Agent 
The Paying Agent obligations are summarised as follows: 
 
On each Notes Issue Disbursement Date, and once instructions from the Management 
(a)
Company are received, effect the necessary payments to meet the disbursement 
process, the subscription of the Notes and, if applicable, payment of the Receivables 
purchased or the calling of a Note Series in the immediately next Monthly payment 
Date. In any event, payment of these amounts may be carried out in net amounts.  
 
On each Payment Date, payment of interest and reimbursement of principal of the 
(b)
Notes, once the total tax withholdings have been made accordingly with current tax 
regulations. 
 
On each Monthly Payment Date (or any other payment date in case of Extraordinary 
(c)
Expenses) of the Fund, carry out any payment required by the Management Company 
in relation to the Fund. 
 
If there are no Available Distribution Amount in the General Account on a Payment 
(d)
Date, the Paying Agent will not be required to make any payments. 
The Paying Agent shall carry out the functions entrusted under this section upon receipt of the 
relevant instructions from the Management Company, together with any information and data 
required by the Paying Agent for the performance of any such functions.  


 
 
143 
 
Any instructions received by the Paying Agent from the Management Company shall be 
deemed valid and effective, without the Paying Agent being obliged to verify the suitability, 
appropriateness or adequacy of such instructions. Consequently, the Paying Agent shall be 
released from any liability arising from their execution and/or processing in good faith (save 
where the Paying Agent has incurred in willful misconduct or negligence (either by act or by 
omission). 
In the event of failure or delay by the Management Company to provide the relevant 
instructions or information (in whole or in part), the Paying Agent shall not perform any 
action until such instructions or information are received. In any event, such failure or delay 
shall not be attributable to the Paying Agent and, therefore, the Management Company shall 
not claim any amount to the Paying Agent in connection thereto and the Fund shall hold the 
Paying Agent harmless against any claims as a result of such failure or delay which may be 
made by the beneficiaries of such payments, collections, performances unrealized or realized 
belatedly, under the terms set out in section 5.2.2 below. 
The Paying Agent shall make the Fund payments, in accordance with the relevant Priority of 
Payments set out in section 3.4.7.2 of the Additional Building Block: 
 
on each Monthly Payment Date; and  
(a)
 
on any other date scheduled for such payment as set out in the Deed of Incorporation 
(b)
or the Base Prospectus,  
by debiting the corresponding Issuer Account, after receiving appropriate instructions of the 
Management Company. 
The instructions of the Management Company to the Paying Agent must be received by the 
Paying Agent at least one (1) Business Day before the relevant Monthly Payment Date (with 
respect to payments of interest or principal under the Notes) or one (1) Business Day before 
the date on which the Paying Agent shall effect the corresponding payment (in all the other 
cases).  
In case that such instructions are not received on time, the Paying Agent shall immediately 
notify the Management Company of such circumstance so that the Management Company 
instructs the Paying Agent accordingly. In the absence of any such instructions, the Paying 
Agent will not make any payment. 
Given that in accordance with the 3.4.5 of the Additional Building Block the Issuer Bank 
Accounts will not be allowed to have a negative balance to the detriment of the Fund, in the 
event that the relevant Issuer Account does not have sufficient funds to make the 
corresponding payment in accordance with instructions received from the Management 
Company, the Paying Agent shall notify the Management Company, and shall refrain from 
making any payment until it receives further instructions from the Management Company. 


 
 
144 
 
The payments of principal and interest (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any arrears of 
interest, where applicable) in respect of the Notes of any Note Series in accordance with the 
Priority of Payments set out in section 3.4.7.2 of the Additional Building Block will be made: 
 
in case of listed Notes, by transfer to the account of the relevant participants in 
(a)
IBERCLEAR (the Participant Entities) at which the Notes of the relevant Note 
Series are registered, according to the procedures of IBERCLEAR applicable from 
time to time;  
 
in case of unlisted Notes in book-entry form, by transfer to the account duly notified 
(b)
by the Noteholder to the duly licensed financial institution appointed by the 
Management Company to manage such registry, for such purposes; and  
 
in case of unlisted Notes in registered form, by transfer to the account duly notified 
(c)
by the Noteholder to the Management Company. 
Upon the occurrence of an unforeseen event which, in the Paying Agent’s sole opinion, would 
make the execution of such instructions risky or harmful, the Paying Agent shall suspend the 
performance of its functions and immediately seek new instructions from the Management 
Company.  
The Management Company shall provide such instructions to the Paying Agent as soon as 
possible in the manner provided in this section. If as a result of the delay by the Management 
Company to provide such new instructions a delay is caused in the payments to be effected by 
the Fund, the Management Company shall not claim any amount to the Paying Agent in 
connection thereto and the Fund shall hold the Paying Agent harmless against any claims as a 
result of such delay raised by the beneficiaries of such payments, under the terms set out in 
section 5.2.2 below. 
The Paying Agent shall communicate to the Management Company by email, before 13:00 
CET of any Interest Determination Date, the Interest Rate applicable to the Floating Rate 
Notes including the supporting documentation for such calculations in accordance with 
section 4.8.6 of the Securities Note of the Base Prospectus. 
5.2.2. Limitation of liability of the Paying Agent  
The Paying Agent will indemnify the Fund and compensate it in respect of any direct damage 
or loss incurred by either of them or the holders of the Notes by reason of willful misconduct 
or negligence (either by act or by omission) on the part of the Paying Agent. 
The Paying Agent will not be liable for losses, damages, costs or expenses as a result of any 
fraudulent act, omission of information, misrepresentation, fraud or negligence or error in 
sending or receiving by the Management Company or refraining from performing any 
instruction in accordance with section 5.2.1 above, or third parties in relation to the 
information used by the Paying Agent for the exercise of its functions. 


 
 
145 
 
In addition, the Paying Agent shall not be under any liability for interest on any money at any 
time received by it, unless such monies are improperly withheld by it or delay in making 
payment of such monies to the relevant recipient is attributable to the negligence or technical 
failure on the part of the Paying Agent. 
5.2.3. Resignation by the Paying Agent  
The Paying Agent may, at any time upon not less than ninety (90) calendar days' written 
notice (or such shorter time as may be agreed between the Paying Agent and the Management 
Company), notify the Management Company in writing that it wishes to cease to be the 
Paying Agent.  
Upon receipt of an early termination notice, the Management Company will appoint a new 
Fund’s paying agent (a New Paying Agent) provided that the following conditions are met

delays, the Management Company, at the expense of the Fund, may advance any such costs 
and expenses and request subsequently their reimbursement by the Paying Agent. 
The resignation by the Paying Agent shall not take any effect until the appointment of the 
New Paying Agent is effective. The termination by the Paying Agent of the performance of

Management Company to the Relevant Rating Agencies and, if applicable, the CNMV.

any material representation or warranty made by the Paying Agent under any 
(a)
Programme Document to which it is a party is or proves to have been incorrect or 
misleading in any material respect when made, and the same is not remedied (if 
capable of remedy) within five (5) Business Days after the Management Company 
has given notice thereof to the Paying Agent or (if sooner) the Paying Agent has 
knowledge of the same, provided that the Management Company, at its discretion, 
certifies that it is material and prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders; 
 
the Paying Agent has failed to comply with any of its material obligations under any 
(b)
Programme Document to which it is a party unless such breach is capable of remedy 
and is remedied within five (5) Business Days after the Management Company has 
given notice thereof to the Paying Agent or (if sooner) the Paying Agent has 


 
 
147 
 
knowledge of the same, provided that the Management Company, at its discretion, 
certifies that it is material and prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders; 
 
an Insolvency Event occurs in respect of the Paying Agent; 
(c)
 
at any time it is or becomes unlawful for the Paying Agent to perform or comply with 
(d)
any or all of its material obligations under any Programme Document to which it is a 
party or any or all of its material obligations under any Programme Document to 
which it is a party are not, or cease to be, legal, valid and binding;  
 
any failure by the Paying Agent to make any payment under any Programme 
(e)
Documents to which it is a party, when due, except if such failure is due to technical 
or administrative reasons and is remedied within five (5) Business Days after such 
failure; or 
(f) 
the Paying Agent ceases to be an Eligible Paying Agent. 
For these purposes, Eligible Paying Agent means a depository institution organised under the 
laws of any state which is a member of the European Union, and is authorised to take deposits 
in Spain. 
All the costs incurred in the replacement of the Paying Agent to another Eligible Paying 
Agent will be paid by the replaced Paying Agent or the Fund if such replaced Paying Agent is 
unable to bear such costs. 
5.2.6. Subcontracting 
The Paying Agent may subcontract or delegate to third parties with acknowledged capacity, 
the paying agency functions, when (i) legally possible, (ii) there is prior written consent from 
the Management Company on behalf of the Fund, and (iii) the subcontractor or delegate has 
waived the right to claim any responsibility from the Fund. The Paying Agent may cancel 
such subcontracts or delegations under the same terms. 
In any event, this subcontracting or delegation shall not imply any extra costs or expenses for 
the Fund or the Management Company. Neither of them will assume any additional liability 
as a result of such subcontracting or delegation. 
Any subcontracting will be subject to the prior approval of the CNMV, if legally necessary. 
5.2.7. Remuneration of the Paying Agent 
As consideration for the services to be provided by the Paying Agent, the Management 
Company, for and on behalf of the Fund, shall pay on each Monthly Payment Date a fee 
agreed between the Paying Agent and the Management Company.

Credit ratings assigned by the Rating Agencies 
7.5.1. Ratings assigned to the Rated Notes 
As described in sections 4.13.2 and 4.13.3 of the Securities Note, the issue of Rated Notes of 
each Notes Series under the Programme on the corresponding Issue Date shall be subject to, 
amongst others: 
 
In case of a Note Series issued on the Fund Incorporation Date, the Class A Notes of 
(a)
the Note Series to be issued are assigned a preliminary rating of “AA(high)(sf)” and 
“AA+(sf)” respectively by DBRS and Fitch. 
 
In case of a Note Series issued on any Issue Date other than the Fund Incorporation 
(b)
Date: 
(i) 
the Class A Notes of the new Note Series to be issued are assigned a 
preliminary rating of “AA(high)(sf)” and “AA+(sf)” (or are preliminarily 
assigned the then current rating of the outstanding Class A Notes) 
respectively by DBRS and Fitch and/or the equivalent ratings from the other 
Relevant Rating Agencies provided (i) always that the Class A Notes shall be 
rated at least by two of the Relevant Rating Agencies and (ii) the issuance of 


 
 
150 
 
the Class A Notes does not result in the downgrade or withdrawal by the 
Relevant Rating Agencies of the then current rating of outstanding Class A 
Notes; 
(ii) 
as applicable, (i) the Class B Notes of the new Note Series to be issued (as 
the case may be) are rated at least by two of the Relevant Rating Agencies 
and (ii) if any Class B Notes are outstanding, (a) the Class B Notes of the 
new Note Series are assigned preliminarily at least the then current rating of 
the outstanding Class B Notes by the Relevant Rating Agencies and (b) the 
issuance of the Class B Notes of the new Note Series does not result in the 
downgrade or withdrawal by the Relevant Rating Agencies of the then 
current rating of the outstanding Class B Notes. 
The Class A Notes and the Class B Notes (if any) of any Note Series shall always be Rated 
Notes.  
It is not obligatory that the Class C Notes are Rated Notes. That said, if the Class C Notes of 
any Note Series are Rated Notes, the Class C Notes of the such Note Series shall be rated at 
least by two of the Relevant Rating Agencies. 
The preliminary ratings assigned to the Rated Notes of each Notes Series shall be specified in 
the applicable Issuing Document and must be confirmed by the Relevant Rating before the 
disbursement of the relevant Notes on the Disbursement Date of each Rated Notes.  
In accordance with section 4.4.7.1 of the Registration Document, failure to obtain 
confirmation from the Relevant Rating Agencies of the preliminary ratings initially assigned 
(or if such ratings are withdrawn) before the disbursement of the Notes on the Disbursement 
Date of such Notes Series shall entail the termination of the issue of the Notes Series in 
question.  
For these purposes:  
Relevant Rating Agencies means the Rating Agencies specified in the applicable Issuing 
Document in respect of any Class of Notes of any Note Series outstanding at such time. 
Rating Agency means any rating agency between DBRS, Fitch, Moody’s and S&P. 
7.5.2. Considerations regarding the rating assigned to the Notes by the Rating 
Agencies 
The meaning of the ratings assigned to the Rated Notes can be consulted in the web pages of 
the Relevant Rating Agencies; this is, as applicable, www.dbrs.com, www.fitchratings.com, 
www.moodys.com or www.standardandpoors.com. 
The ratings assigned by the Rating Agencies do not constitute an evaluation of the likelihood 
of the Borrowers repaying the Receivables early, or of the extent to which such early 


 
 
151 
 
repayments differ from those originally estimated. In no way do the ratings represent a rating 
of the level of actuarial yield. 
The assigned ratings, as well as any revision or suspension thereof: 
 
are formulated by the Rating Agencies on the basis of varied information received, 
(a)
the accuracy and completeness of which is not guaranteed by the Rating Agencies, 
and therefore the Rating Agencies will in no event be held liable for the contents 
thereof; and 
 
do not constitute and, therefore, could not in any way be interpreted as an invitation, 
(b)
recommendation or solicitation for investors to proceed to carry out any type of 
transaction with the Rated Notes and, in particular, to acquire, retain, encumber or 
sell such Rated Notes. The final ratings of a Class of Notes may be revised, 
suspended or withdrawn at any time by the Rating Agencies, depending on any 
information that comes to their knowledge. Such situations will be notified 
immediately both to the CNMV and the Noteholders of the Rated Notes. 
To perform the rating and monitoring process, the Rating Agencies rely on the accuracy and 
completeness of the information that they are given by the Seller, the Management Company, 
the Arrangers, the Auditor and the legal advisors. 
These credit ratings are only an estimate and do not necessarily mean that potential investors 
do not have to conduct their own analysis of the Rated Notes that they intend to buy. 
In accordance with section 4.4.7.1 of the Registration Document, failure to obtain 
confirmation from the Rating Agencies of the preliminary ratings (or if such ratings are 
withdrawn) before the disbursement of the relevant Notes on the Disbursement Date for such 
Notes Series shall entail the termination of the issue of the Notes Series in question.

The Management Company confirms that the cash flows to be generated by Purchased 
Receivables, according to the contractual terms and conditions of the Credit Card Agreements 
under which they derive, shall permit the payment of all the amounts due and payable in 
relation to the Notes in accordance with the relevant Priority of Payments. However, in order 
to cover for possible payment defaults by the Borrowers and thus enhance its financial 
structure and procure the largest possible coverage for the risks inherent to the Notes Series, 
the Management Company, on behalf of the Fund, will put in place a number of enhancement 
transactions as set out in section 3.4.3 of this Additional Building Block. Likewise, some 
Notes Series may have Hedging Agreements according to the provisions of the relevant

(iv) the ratings assigned to the Rated Notes by the Relevant Rating Agencies as described in 
section 7.5 of the Securities Note. 
2.2. 
Assets backing the Notes Series 
Introduction 
The Receivables to be transferred to the Fund on the Fund Incorporation Date and thereafter 
on each Purchase Date during the life of the Fund are credit card receivables arising from 
drawings made by the Borrowers under the revolving credit facilities granted to such 
Borrowers by the Seller under the terms of the Credit Card Agreements. The Client Accounts 
associated with the Credit Cards Agreements from which the Receivables comprising the 
Audited Portfolio arise all have the same contractual conditions. 
The credit facilities made available under the Credit Card Agreements are of a revolving 
nature, meaning that any principal repayment will reconstitute the credit available to the 
Borrower and may be re-drawn by the Borrower. The maximum amount of the credit which 
can be drawn by any Borrower (the Credit Limit) is set out in the relevant Credit Card 
Agreement and may be increased or decreased by the Seller in accordance with and subject to 
the limitations set out in its Credit Policies. 
All Credit Card Agreements from which the Receivables included in the Audited Portfolio 
arise have been granted to Borrowers which are individuals resident in Spain as of the signing 
date of the corresponding Credit Card Agreement. Furthermore, the Borrowers under such 
Receivables had their most recent billing address located in Spain as of the Purchase Date of 
such Receivables.  
For these purposes, Borrower means, in relation to any Credit Card Agreement, the 
individual who has entered into such Credit Card Agreement as principal obligor to the Seller. 
Main cardholder and authorised users 
Credit Card Agreements are signed with a main cardholder, who is the Borrower of the 
revolving credit facility granted under each Client Account associated with each Credit Card 
Agreement. Additional (physical) credit cards may be issued by the Seller to authorised users 
linked to the same Client Account. Credit analysis is performed by the Seller in respect of the 
Borrower only (and not on additional authorised users). 
For these purposes, Client Account means the revolving credit account which is opened in 
the books of the Seller with respect to any Credit Card Agreement. 
Purpose of the Credit Card Agreements 


 
 
154 
 
The purpose of the Credit Card Agreements is to provide consumer credit to the Borrowers. 
 
Drawings under the Credit Card Agreements 
In connection with each Credit Card Agreement, a (physical) credit card is always delivered 
to the Borrower by the Seller (a Credit Card). For information purposes, it is noted that the 
Credit Cards are operated by MasterCard®. Each physical card is valid for a period of 48 
months. Once this period expires, if the associated credit facility continues to meet all the 
criteria for its renewal, a new valid physical card is issued for a further period of 48 months. 
The revolving credit facility made available by the Seller to the Borrower under a Credit Card 
Agreement is used by the Borrower: 
 
by making use of the Credit Card to: 
(a)
(i) 
pay the price for the goods or services acquired,  
(ii) 
withdraw cash in automated teller machines (ATMs) or cash withdrawal 
systems which permit these services; or  
 
to receive transfers of funds in the relevant account of the Borrower by means of 
(b)
phone or internet request or by means of a request at the stores of certain entities of 
the Carrefour group and other third party stores where this possibility is offered.  
Moreover, as further explained below (see section entitled “Interest and fees payable under 
the Credit Card Agreements”), the Seller may charge fees to the Borrower (fees may be 
charged for cash withdrawals, non-payment, wire transfers to the Borrower's account and 
currency exchange). Payment of these fees (other than the late payment fee as further 
explained below) is financed by the Seller under the relevant Client Account. This means that 
such fees are not paid in full by the Borrower but rather payment thereof is financed by the 
Seller with the Credit Card (and therefore, the Outstanding Principal Balance of the relevant 
Client Account is increased in the amount of the relevant fee). By way of exception to the 
foregoing, late payment fees are added to the relevant Monthly Minimum Instalment and 
payment thereof is sought in full and are only financed by the Borrower if they are unpaid. 
Likewise, where the Borrower elects to take out insurance protection (see section entitled 
“Insurance” for further details), the Borrower must pay an insurance premium on a monthly 
basis. Unpaid monthly insurance premiums are also financed by the Seller under the relevant 
Client Account in the fashion as described above. Accordingly, fees charged to the Borrower 
(other than the late payment fee which is only financed if it is unpaid), unpaid late payment 
fees and unpaid insurance premiums amount to Drawings for all purposes and, therefore, they 
increase the Outstanding Principal Balance of the relevant Client Account, accrue interest at 
the interest rate then applicable to the Drawings and are repaid in Monthly Instalments (as 
defined and explained in section below entitled “Monthly Payments”). 


 
 
155 
 
Moreover, as further explained in section below entitled “Type of Repayment Options”, 
Credit Card Agreements allow for two main repayment options, either (i) in a single interest-
free repayment (contado inmediato or contado fin de mes) or (ii) in interest-bearing 
instalments (crédito). Where a single interest-free instalment is unpaid by the Borrower, the 
Seller may finance payment thereof by means of a Drawing under the Client Account, 
provided this is expressly accepted by the Borrower. This feature is referred to by the Seller 
as “basculación”. 
Consequently, any drawdowns made by the Borrower (or any other authorized user) under the 
revolving credit facility granted under each Client Account associated to each Credit Card 
Agreement, and which includes (i) any fees financed by the Seller (other than the late 
payment fee, unless it is unpaid), (ii) any unpaid insurance premium under the optional 
Insurance Policy entered by the Borrower financed by the Seller and (iii) any unpaid single 
interest-free instalment financed by the Seller with the prior consent of the Borrower 
(“basculación”) shall be considered a Drawing.  
Drawings under the Client Account are accounted for in monthly billing periods or payment 
cycles (the Monthly Billing Period) which do not coincide with calendar months. As a 
general rule, each Monthly Billing Period starts on the twenty first (21st) day of each calendar 
month and ends on the twentieth (20th) day of the following calendar month and is referred to 
in the Credit Card Agreements as “billing period” (periodo de liquidación).  
The outstanding principal balance (“Saldo Dispuesto”) of a Client Account is defined as the 
outstanding balance of the credit facility as reflected in the corresponding Client Account 
associated with each Credit Card Agreement at any given time. The Outstanding Principal 
Balance on any specific date (the Outstanding Principal Balance) is:  
 
in respect of any Receivables and on any date, the total amount of principal which is 
(a)
due by the Borrower on such date (taking into account as the case may be, any 
principal amounts remaining unpaid increasing such total amount and any principal 
amounts prepaid decreasing such total amount); or, as the case may be, 
 
on any given date, the result of the sum of: (i) the Outstanding Principal Balance of 
(b)
the Client Account at the close of the immediately prior Monthly Billing Period, plus 
(ii) the sum of the Drawings made since the close of such Monthly Billing Period, 
minus (iii) any principal payments made since the close of such Monthly Billing 
Period.  
Type of repayment options 
Credit Card Agreements allow for two main repayment options, either (i) in a single interest-
free repayment (contado inmediato or contado fin de mes) (Cash Re-payment Option) or (ii) 
in interest-bearing instalments (crédito). The Seller has in place systems that allow the 
allocation of each single transaction to one or the other type of repayment options. 


 
 
156 
 
The Receivables comprising the Audited Portfolio provide only for repayments in interest-
bearing instalments as per (ii) above. No single interest-free repayment (contado inmediato or 
contado fin de mes) receivables will be transferred to the Fund. Where a single interest-free 
instalment is unpaid by the Borrower, the Seller may finance payment thereof by means of a 
Drawing under the Client Account, provided this is expressly accepted by the Borrower. This 
feature is referred to by the Seller as “basculación”. 
The choice of the repayment option is made by the Borrower at the time of entering into the 
Credit Card Agreement but may be changed afterwards. 
However, those Borrowers who have elected the repayment option of interest-bearing 
instalments can still elect, at the time any purchase is made by them within certain entities of 
the Carrefour group and other third party stores where this possibility is offered, that such 
purchase is paid in a single interest-free repayment (contado inmediato or contado fin de mes) 
rather than in interest-bearing instalments (in which case, such payment will not form part of 
the revolving balance of the Credit Card and will therefore not be assigned to the Fund). 
Type of Credit Cards 
As noted above, in connection with each Credit Card Agreement, a (physical) Credit Card is 
always delivered to the Borrower by the Seller. For information purposes, the Seller currently 
issues four (4) types of Credit Cards, which main characteristics are the following:  
 
Classic - PASS credit card:  
(a)
(i) 
offered to all physical Seller’s customers; 
(ii) 
allows for two main repayment options, either (i) in a single interest-free 
repayment (contado inmediato or contado fin de mes) or (ii) in interest-
bearing instalments (crédito); and 
(iii) 
interest rate is set at 20.04% as of the date of this Base Prospectus.  
 
Gold - PASS credit card:   
(b)
(i) 
offered to certain physical Seller’s customers depending on the Seller’s 
commercial interests; 
(ii) 
allows for two main repayment options, either (i) in a single interest-free 
repayment (contado inmediato or contado fin de mes) or (ii) in interest-
bearing instalments (crédito); and 
(iii) 
interest rate is set at 20.04% as of the date of this Base Prospectus. 
 
Employee - PASS credit card:     
(c)
(i) 
offered exclusively to Carrefour group employees; 


 
 
157 
 
(ii) 
allows for two main repayment options, either (i) in a single interest-free 
repayment (contado inmediato or contado fin de mes) or (ii) in interest-
bearing instalments (crédito); and 
(iii) 
interest rate is set at 12.00% as of the date of this Base Prospectus. 
For clarification purposes, no Receivables arising from Employee - PASS credit cards 
will be transferred to the Fund. 
 
Business - PASS credit card:     
(d)
(i) 
offered exclusively to Carrefour group managers (directivos) for 
representation expenses (not for personal use); 
(ii) 
allows for a single interest-free repayment; and 
(iii) 
does not bear interests. 
For clarification purposes, no Receivables arising from Business - PASS credit cards 
will be transferred to the Fund. 
Credit limits 
Every Client Account has a Credit Limit set by the Seller in accordance with its Credit 
Policies. Among the factors considered for setting the initial Credit Limit are the Borrower's 
age, level of income, the number of years employed, his/her marital status, etc. The usual 
Credit Limit varies between EUR 150 and EUR 9,999.  
Credit Limits assigned to each Borrower are reviewed monthly by the Seller on the basis of 
the performance of the Borrower and may be revised (upwards or downwards) accordingly. 
Borrowers can reject a limit increase. New limits (which are duly notified to the Borrowers 
but which do not imply the signing of a new Credit Card Agreement) come into force in the 
Monthly Billing Period following the one in which the Borrower has been notified by the 
Seller of the change. Borrowers can also request a reduction or increase of the limit. The 
increase can be requested at the time of making a Drawing in the stores of Centros 
Comerciales Carrefour, S.A. in an amount not exceeding EUR 600. Any request by the 
Borrower to increase the Credit Limit must be approved by the Seller.  
The positive difference between the Credit Limit on each Client Account and its Outstanding 
Principal Balance at any given time is defined as the Available Balance (Saldo Disponible) 
of the Client Account. 
This notwithstanding, Client Accounts can be occasionally overdrawn (i) in the event of non-
payment of any amounts whether for interest or principal (including non-payment of single 
interest-free instalments under the Cash Re-payment Option in the event of "basculación" as 
explained in the immediately preceding section) and (ii) in an amount not exceeding the 


 
 
158 
 
amount of a Monthly Minimum Instalment. In such circumstances, the relevant overdrawn 
Client Account will not be capable of further Drawings while the overdrawn remains. 
 
Interest and fees payable under the Credit Card Agreements 
The Outstanding Principal Balance under the Client Account accrues interest on a daily basis 
at a fixed rate. The interest period for the purposes of calculation of interest payable is each 
calendar month. Interest payable is calculated at the end of the relevant Monthly Billing 
Period. 
Unpaid Drawings and overdrafts do not accrue default interest but unpaid interest is 
capitalised and accrues further ordinary interest. The interest rate applicable to both overdrafts 
and unpaid interest under a Client Account is the same as that applied to the Outstanding 
Principal Balance of such Client Account. However, the Seller may charge a fee for claiming 
unpaid amounts (which is currently set at EUR 30) provided it undertakes actual collection 
actions aimed at collecting such unpaid amounts.  
The interest rate is contractually agreed between the Seller and the Borrower in the Credit 
Card Agreement. The interest rate can be adjusted by the Seller providing a two (2) month 
prior written notice to the Borrowers. Each Borrower is entitled to refuse such adjustment, in 
which case (i) the interest rate applicable will be the interest rate applicable prior to the 
proposed adjustment, (ii) the Borrower will not be entitled to make any further Drawings 
under the relevant Credit Card Agreement and (iii) the Borrower will continue to repay all 
outstanding Drawings made under the relevant Credit Card Agreement in accordance with the 
conditions of the Credit Card Agreement as in force prior to the proposed adjustment. 
Pursuant to the Credit Card Agreement the Seller may charge fees to the Borrower for cash 
withdrawals, non-payment (as described above), wire transfers to the Borrower's account and 
currency exchange. As indicated above, payment of these fees (other than the late payment 
fee, unless it is unpaid) is financed by the Seller under the Client Account in the same manner 
as with any other Drawings. Accordingly, fees (other than the late payment fee, unless it is 
unpaid) increase the Outstanding Principal Balance of each Client Account and accrue 
interest. Therefore, these financed fees will be included within the principal collections 
transferred by the Servicer to the Fund. 
Monthly Payments 
The minimum amount of each monthly payment due by the Borrower is set in the Credit Card 
Agreement entered into with the Borrower (the Monthly Minimum Instalment) and is the 
lower of (i) the full outstanding debt of Borrower (comprising principal, capitalised interest, 
ordinary interest and any other amount due by the Borrower) or (ii) a fixed pre-agreed amount 
set in the Credit Card Agreement (which shall be at least equal to 3% of the Credit Limit 
(with a minimum of EUR 15)).  


 
 
159 
 
The amount of each Monthly Minimum Instalment comprises ordinary interest accrued on the 
related calendar month, insurance premium (where applicable) and repayment of principal 
and capitalised interest.  
If a Monthly Minimum Instalment is unpaid, its amount is not aggregated with the amount of 
the following Monthly Minimum Instalment but rather separate payment thereof by the 
Borrower (plus interest thereon) is sought by means of requesting the Borrower a subsequent 
direct debit remittance or by other means such as wire transfer to the Seller or cash payment 
at the stores of Centros Comerciales Carrefour, S.A. (amounts so collected being transferred 
by Centros Comerciales Carrefour, S.A. to the Seller within three (3) Business Days).  
Every Credit Card is associated with a bank account (the Charge Accounts) where the Seller 
debits the amounts payable under the Credit Card Agreement on a monthly basis by means of 
direct debit. Charge Accounts are current accounts opened at Spanish financial institutions in 
the Borrower's name (the Charge Account Banks). On a monthly basis (following the end of 
each Monthly Billing Period), the Seller instructs its Collections Accounts Banks (which are 
currently Banco Santander, S.A. and Bankia, S.A.) to collect the relevant Receivables by 
direct debit and, to that end, it remits all relevant Receivables' data to such Collections 
Accounts Banks for them to collect the amounts due thereunder by direct debit.  
Each Collections Accounts Banks credits the amount of each batch of Receivables remitted to 
it for collection by the Seller into the account in the name of the Seller held by such 
Collections Accounts Banks (the Collections Accounts) even prior to collecting those 
Receivables from the Charge Account Banks.  
The Collections Accounts will be used exclusively in connection with the amounts to be 
collected under the Purchased Receivables (including any amounts related to the insurance 
premia). 
In accordance with section 3.7.2.7 of the Additional Building Block, SFC (as Servicer) has 
the obligation to grant an in rem right of pledge over each Collections Account. Please see 
section 3.4.3.9 for additional information on this security granted over the Collections 
Accounts. 
Some of the Receivables included in a monthly remittance may be returned by the relevant 
Charge Account Bank (for instance, due to insufficiency of funds standing to the credit of the 
relevant Charge Account), in which case the relevant Collections Accounts Banks will debit 
the corresponding Collections Accounts in an amount equal to that of the Receivables being 
returned. 
Whilst monthly payments are charged to the Charge Accounts by direct debit, Borrowers can 
also, in exceptional circumstances (such as payment of unpaid amounts), use other methods of 
payment, such as wire transfers and payment in person at the stores of Centros Comerciales 
Carrefour, S.A. (amounts so collected being transferred by Centros Comerciales Carrefour, 
S.A. to the Seller within three (3) Business Days).

Returns of purchases 
Borrowers may return purchases made with the Credit Cards and such returns may result in a 
“reverse drawing” under the Credit Cards, in which case: 
 
if the return takes place before the cut-off date used by the Seller to calculate the 
(a)
Outstanding Principal Balance under the corresponding Client Account and provide 
the monthly statement to the Borrower (which is the last day of each Monthly Billing 
Period), the effect of the return is that the Outstanding Principal Balance is restored as 
if no purchase had taken place and no interest is payable by the Borrower in respect 
of such Drawing; and 
 
if the return takes place after such cut-off date, the Outstanding Principal Balance for 
(b)
the purposes of such monthly statement would include the amount of the purchase as 
if it had not been returned and, provided the Borrower pays the relevant Monthly 
Minimum Instalment, the Seller shall reimburse the Borrower at the end of the next 
Monthly Billing Period the amount of the principal payment corresponding to the 
returned purchase. Where the returned purchase was made within stores of the 
Carrefour group, interest paid will also be reimbursed. Reimbursement of principal 
(and, if applicable, interest) is made either by way of reduction of the Outstanding 
Principal Balance in the following Monthly Billing Period or, if the latter is 
insufficient, the excess is reimbursed by wire transfer to the Borrower. In such latter 
case, amounts so transferred, shall be reimbursed by the Fund to the Seller on the next 
Settlement Date, such payment not being subject to the Priority of Payments. 
Guarantees 
The Receivables do not benefit from any personal guarantee or security securing payment 
thereof. However, the Borrower as main cardholder is jointly and severally liable for the debt 
of any authorised users of Credit Cards provided under the same Credit Card Agreement.  
Insurance 
The Credit Card Agreements offer the Borrower the option of taking out insurance to cover 
the risk of the Borrower's death, temporary or permanent incapacity, unemployment, 
hospitalisation or fraudulent use of the Credit Card (in the latter case, up to an amount of 
EUR 150) (the Insurance Policies). Entering into an Insurance Policy is entirely voluntary, at 
the Borrower's request, and operates by means of the payment of a monthly premium 
calculated as a percentage of the Outstanding Principal Balance of the Client Account for the 
relevant month.  
The Insurance Policies are entered into with Carma, Société Anonyme, Carma Vie, Société 
Anonyme, Cardif Assurance Vie, Sucursal en España and Cardif Assurances Risques Divers, 
Sucursal en España. 


 
 
161 
 
Carma, Société Anonyme and Carma Vie, Société Anonyme are French insurance companies 
belonging to the Carrefour group. They are authorised to provide cross-border services in 
Spain by the relevant insurance authorities (Dirección General de Seguros y Fondos de 
Pensiones) and are registered with numbers L0847 and L0848 respectively. Carma, Société 
Anonyme address is at Rue du Marquis de Raises – 91008 Evry, Cedex. Carma Vie, Société 
Anonyme address is at 1 Jean Mermoz – 91002 Evry, Cedex. 
Cardif Assurance Vie, Sucursal en España and Cardif Assurances Risques Divers, Sucursal en 
España are Spanish branches of French insurance companies belonging to the BNP Paribas 
group. The branches have their address in Madrid at C/ Emilio Vargas nº4, 3º PLT, 28043 and 
have Spanish tax identification numbers W0012421D and W0012420F. They are authorised 
to provide services in Spain by the relevant insurance authorities (Dirección General de 
Seguros y Fondos de Pensiones) and are registered with numbers E0129 and E0130 
respectively.  
However, there is no assurance and no commitment that in the future the Seller will remain 
the beneficiary of the Insurance Indemnifications in respect of those Credit Card Agreements 
or any future Credit Card Agreements. This notwithstanding, where the Seller is designated as 
beneficiary of the Insurance Indemnification, such payments will form part of the rights 
conferred upon the Fund. 
For these purposes: 
Insurance Indemnifications means any amounts payable to the Seller under any Insurance 
Policies entered into by the relevant Borrower in connection with any Credit Card Agreement. 
Insurance Policies means the optional insurance policies entered into by the Borrowers in 
connection with any Credit Card Agreement in respect of which the Seller has been, and 
remains, designated as “beneficiary” (beneficiario). 
Interchange Fees 
Members participating in the MasterCard® associations (including the Seller) receive fees 
called “Interchange Fees” as partial compensation, for amongst other things, taking credit 
risk and absorbing fraud losses. Under the MasterCard® system, Interchange Fees are passed 
from the credit entities clearing the credit card transactions for merchants to the card issuing 
entities. Interchange Fees are calculated as a percentage of the amount of the credit card 
transaction for the purchase of goods or services. This percentage varies from time to time. 
Interchange Fees will not be transferred by the Seller to the Fund. 
Prepayments 
Notwithstanding the scheduled monthly repayments, the Borrower may prepay all or part of 
the Drawings made under a Credit Card Agreement at any time, without any fee or penalty 
being applied by the Seller in relation to such prepayment.

Centros Comerciales Carrefour loyalty programme 
As at the date of this prospectus, the Seller is part of the loyalty programme set up by Centros 
Comerciales Carrefour, S.A. by means of the creation of the “Club Carrefour”. According to 
this loyalty programme, the customers participating can obtain rewards by using the Credit 
Card for the purchase of goods and services in certain establishments. 
The rewards are accumulated on a quarterly basis by the customer in a gift voucher which is 
delivered by Centros Comerciales Carrefour, S.A. and which can be redeemed in one (1) time 
in establishments belonging to the Carrefour group. The gift voucher is issued four (4) times a 
year.  
In particular, the Borrowers participating in the loyalty programme may accumulate in the gift 
voucher 1% of the amount of the purchases made with the Credit Card depending on the type 
of establishment in with the purchase is made.  
The Seller communicates to Centros Comerciales Carrefour, S.A. the individual amounts to 
be included in the gift voucher and pays to Centros Comerciales Carrefour, S.A. the total 
amount in relation thereto which is ultimately payable by the Seller according to the 
agreement between the parties. However, the Seller does not issue the gift voucher nor post it 
as a credit in favour of the Borrowers. There is no agreement between the Borrowers forming 
part of the loyalty programme and the Seller regarding the loyalty programme or the gift 
voucher.  
Consequently, the Seller has no liability vis-à-vis the Borrowers as a result of the rewards 
accumulated in the gift voucher and the amounts paid by Seller to Centros Comerciales 
Carrefour, S.A. in connection with the voucher are not set-off with any amounts arising from 
the Credit Card Agreements but rather paid by the Seller as part of its costs structure.  
Audit Report on the Credit Cards 
The Receivables to be transferred to the Fund on the Fund Incorporation Date were the 
subject of an audit carried out with data as of 15 March 2017 by Mazars, in compliance with 
the provisions of article 22 of Law 5/2015. The Audit Report is dated 30 March 2017.  
The Audit Report was prepared using sampling techniques, which constitute a generally 
accepted method for verifying the records kept by an entity in relation to a series of items (the 
“population”), and which permit a conclusion to be reached regarding such population, by 
analysing a smaller number of items than the whole (a “sample”). The level of confidence 
indicates the likelihood that the actual number of items with deviations in relation to a given 
estimate for a population does not exceed a pre-set limit (“precision”). The sample size and 
level of confidence chosen determine that the inexistence of errors in the sample entails a 
maximum number of errors inferred for the population, which cannot be zero (0). 


 
 
163 
 
The Receivables selected in the sample audited and regarding which errors have been 
detected in some of the attributes analysed in the Audit Report will not be assigned to the 
Fund. 
The Management Company declares that all Receivables to be assigned to the Fund on the 
Fund Incorporation Date will derive from Credit Card Agreements included in the Audited 
Portfolio. 
The outcome of the audit is set out in the Audit Report prepared by the Auditor, which is one 
of the documents for consultation, as per section 10 of the Registry Document. The Auditor's 
identification details are indicated in section 5.2 of the Registration Document. 
The attributes audited in the Audit Report are as follows: 
 
Ownership of the Receivables 
 
Identification of the Borrower 
 
Borrower nature  
 
Transfer of the Receivables 
 
Formalization of the Credit Card Agreement

Additional audits carried out by the Auditor (or any other auditor or third party expert 
appointed from time to time by the Management Company) will be carried out on an annual 
basis (or with the periodicity required from time to time by the CNMV and the relevant laws 
and/or regulations in place). Such additional audits shall be made over the new Receivables 
(outstanding as of the audit cut-off date) transferred in the context of Initial Transfers since 
the previous annual audit, will audit the same attributes as the initial Audit Report and will be 
submitted to the CNMV together with the annual audited accounts of the Fund.  
2.2.1. Legal jurisdiction by which the pool of assets is governed 
The assets to be securitised will be governed by Spanish law. 
2.2.2. General characteristics of the Receivables, as well as global statistical data 
referred to the securitised assets 
On the Fund Incorporation Date, the Fund will purchase Eligible Receivables deriving from 
Client Accounts arising from Credit Card Agreements included initially in the Audited 
Portfolio.  
The Receivables to be transferred by the Seller to the Fund on the Fund Incorporation Date 
shall consist of a random selection by the Seller of Eligible Receivables of the Audited 
Portfolio.  
The characteristics of the Purchased Receivables on the Fund Incorporation Date may differ 
from the Audited Portfolio due to inter alia prepayments, delinquencies, and defaults and 
from the fact the amount of Eligible Receivables that the Fund will purchase will be less than 
the amount of Eligible Receivables of the the Audited Portfolio. 
As of 15 March 2017, the main characteristics of the Eligible Receivables of the Audited 
Portfolio are summarized in the next table:

Distribution by utilisation rate 
 
For these purposes, the utilisation rate is the ratio of the outstanding debt of the Client 
Account divided by the Credit Limit of the Client Account. 
A utilisation rate above 100% can be the consequence of: 
(i) 
a reduction of the Credit Limit; or 
(ii) 
a mismatch in SFC’s system between (x) the Aggregate Outstanding Debt 
and (y) an additional Drawing.

(l) 
Distribution by insurance type 
 
In all Credit Card Agreements that form part of the Audited Portfolio and which have 
insurance, the Seller has been designated as beneficiary of the insurance payment and 
therefore the Insurance Indemnifications would form part of the rights conferred upon the 
Fund. However, there is no assurance and no commitment that in the future the Seller will 
remain the beneficiary of the Insurance Indemnifications in respect of those Credit Card 
Agreements or any future Credit Card Agreements. 
(m) 
Contractual Payment Rate % of the Credit Limit 
 
Contractual Payment Rate as % means the ratio of the Monthly Payment divided by 
the Credit Limit of the Client Account. 
After the Fund Incorporation Date, the composition of the portfolio of Purchased Receivables 
will be naturally modified as a result inter alia of the purchase of Receivables (in the context 
of Initial Transfers and/or Additional Transfers) by the Fund, the repayment of the Purchased 
Receivables, any prepayments, delinquencies, defaults, any losses related to the Purchased 
Receivables, any retransfer of Purchased Receivables or renegotiations entered into by the 
Servicer in accordance with its Servicing Policies. 
The Investor Reports (with a description of the Purchased Receivables) are published by the 
Management Company on its website (www.imtitulizacion.com). 
2.2.3. Legal nature of the assets 
The Credit Card Agreements and the Receivables deriving from them are subject to Spanish 
law. The main legislation applicable to the Credit Card Agreements is as follows: 
 
Law 16/2009, of 13 November, on Payment Services, which implements Directive 
(a)
2007/64/EC on payment services (Ley 16/2009, de 13 de noviembre, de Servicios de 
Pago); 


 
 
171 
 
 
Order EHA/1608/2010, of 14 June, on transparency of the information conditions and 
(b)
requirements applicable to payment services (Orden EHA/1608/2010, de 14 de junio, 
sobre transparencia de las condiciones y requisitos de información aplicables a los 
servicios de pago);  
 
Law 16/2011, of 24 June, on consumer credit agreements, which implements 
(c)
Directive 2008/48/EC on consumer credit agreements (Ley 16/2011, de 24 de junio, 
de contratos de crédito al consumo) (Law 16/2011); 
 
Order EHA/2899/2011, of 28 October, on transparency and the protection of banking 
(d)
service customers (Orden EHA/2899/2011, de 28 de octubre, de transparencia y 
protección del cliente de servicios bancarios); and 
 
Circular 5/2012, of 27 June, of the Bank of Spain, to credit entities and providers of 
(e)
payment services, on transparency of banking service and liability when granting 
loans (Circular 5/2012, de 27 de junio, del Banco de España, a entidades de crédito y 
proveedores de servicios de pago, sobre transparencia de los servicios bancarios y 
responsabilidad en la concesión de préstamos). 
2.2.4. Expiry or maturity date of the assets 
The Credit Card Agreements are entered into for an indefinite period of time, notwithstanding 
that the Credit Card Agreement may be cancelled in the terms described therein, which are 
summarised below. 
A Borrower may terminate the Credit Card Agreement at any time, subject to giving one (1) 
month's prior notice and repaying the outstanding debt. The Seller may terminate the Credit 
Card Agreement at any time, subject to giving two (2) months' prior notice. In either case, the 
Borrower cannot make new Drawings under the Client Account and the Borrower will 
continue to repay all outstanding Drawings made under the relevant Credit Card Agreement 
in accordance with the conditions of the Credit Card Agreement in force upon at the time of 
such termination. 
The Seller may also terminate the Credit Card Agreement and accelerate the outstanding debt 
reflected in the corresponding Client Account without the need of giving two (2) month prior 
notice, in the event of (i) a deterioration of the Borrower's solvency, (ii) a material breach by 
the Borrower of its obligations under the Credit Card Agreement, (iii) a failure to provide any 
required data or the provision of inaccurate or false data, (iv) an abusive or fraudulent use of 
the Credit Card, (v) the death of the Borrower or (vi) lack of use of the Card for a period 
exceeding two (2) years. In these cases, the relevant Borrower must immediately repay in full 
the outstanding debt (including accrued interests) under the Client Account. 
Despite the indefinite duration of the Credit Card Agreement, each Credit Card has a set 
expiry date, printed thereon and cannot be used after the indicated date. Prior to the Credit 
Card's expiry, the Seller issues a replacement Credit Card. 


 
 
172 
 
2.2.5. Amount of the assets 
The aggregate amount of the Outstanding Principal Balance of the Receivables transferred to 
the Fund on the Fund Incorporation Date will be a figure equal, or (failing that) as close as 
possible, to EUR 638,000,000. 
At any given time, the Outstanding Principal Balance of the Receivables transferred to the 
Fund during the life of the Fund shall not exceed EUR 3,000,000,000 (the Maximum 
Portfolio Amount).  
The Management Company and the Seller may elect to modify such Maximum Portfolio 
Amount pursuant to an amendment to the Deed of Incorporation in the terms set out in article 
24 of Law 5/2015 and through the issue of the relevant Prospectus Supplement (unless such 
modification coincides with a renewal of the Base Prospectus). 
2.2.6. Loan to value ratio or level of collateralization 
Not applicable.  
2.2.7. Asset creation method 
The Seller has applied origination criteria since its creation, which are regularly updated. On 
December 2012, the Board of Directors of the Seller approved general origination policies 
stressing the importance of responsible lending in line with applicable regulations. Subject to 
those general policies, the Risk Committee of the Seller, of which the General Director is a 
member, approves the specific origination criteria, which are regularly reviewed and updated 
by the Risk Committee. The origination criteria described below are the ones currently 
applied. Credit Cards included in the securitisation transaction may have been originated 
following different criteria. It is important to note that the Risk Committee monitors the full 
origination and authorisation process, being fully responsible thereof. 
Credit risk governance 
The criteria for the issue of Credit Cards and the definition of risk appetite form part of the 
Seller's business processes, having established a credit risk governance system based on four 
(4) fundamental pillars: 
 
Board of Directors, which is the Seller's main decision-making body. The Board of 
(a)
Directors of the Seller participates actively in the management of the credit risk 
policy and remains permanently up-to-date regarding development thereof. It issues 
the Seller's Credit Policies and determines the risk appetite.  
 
Risk Committee, whose credit risk management-related duties are summarised below: 
(b)
(i) 
the specification and formalisation, from a credit risk viewpoint, of the 
procedures, processes and criteria for the acceptance of customers and for the 


 
 
173 
 
concession, monitoring, amendment, renewal, recovery and refinancing of 
operations, in compliance with the Credit Policies approved by the Board; 
(ii) 
global monitoring of recoveries and credit risk and proposing corrective 
action plans where necessary; 
(iii) 
quantifying as an aggregate the Seller's risks and comparing capital needs 
with regulatory capital requirements and the Seller's actual equity; and 
(iv) 
participating actively in the development, testing and monitoring of customer 
classification models. 
 
Risk Area, reporting to the Seller's Financial Director (Director Financiero), is 
(c)
entrusted with the daily management of credit risks.  
 
Recoveries Department, reporting to the Seller's Operations Department (Dirección 
(d)
de Operaciones), this is the area entrusted with the daily management of debt 
recovery.  
Monitoring credit risk 
In addition to the four (4) pillars indicated above, on which the credit risk system is based, the 
Seller has developed a monitoring system independent from the foregoing, in order to ensure 
the coherence and sustainability of the Credit Policies for the management of credit risk. This 
system requires the involvement of the following departments within the Seller:  
 
Internal Audit, whose function is to independently verify the implementation of the 
(a)
Credit Policies as well as their stability and sustainability. 
 
Permanent Control, which manages the second level permanent controls necessary to 
(b)
verify independently that cards are issued and managed in line with the established 
policies, procedures and processes. 
 
Compliance, whose function is to provide advice to the areas entrusted with the 
(c)
management of credit risk on regulatory obligations and best market practices.  
Issue of Credit Cards 
 
Application channels 
(a)
In the majority of cases, individuals holding a Credit Card are customers of the 
Carrefour group establishments (hypermarkets, supermarkets, etc.) as it is normally in 
these establishments where the first contact between the customer and the Seller is 
made, during which the Seller collects the information it requires for checking 
purposes and to issue the Credit Card, where applicable.  


 
 
174 
 
Notwithstanding this, the Seller may also try to attract potential customers in 
environments other than the Carrefour group establishments, provided it has the 
relevant authorisations for such purposes. 
The Credit Card may be applied for or offered to customers through any legally valid 
channels in which the Seller is authorised to operate. In all these cases, the Seller is 
responsible for applying its own general origination policies. By way of example, the 
use of the following channels is currently permitted: 
(i) 
Financial and Insurance Services Stand. This is an area set up in the majority 
of Carrefour group hypermarkets with specialised personnel exclusively 
dedicated to financial and insurance services available to Carrefour group 
customers.  
The collection of data and documentation is carried out on a personalised 
basis and the data provided by the potential customer is included directly in 
the Seller's systems. 
(ii) 
Leaflets. Normally provided as “take one” leaflets available to potential 
customers in the Carrefour group shopping centres, but which are also used 
for promotional campaigns at certain events, offering customers an easy way 
to apply for a Credit Card from the Seller, by completing the leaflet and 
providing the necessary documentation in each case. 
In the majority of cases new customers are attracted in person by specialised 
personnel, although in certain circumstances it is the customer himself/herself 
who completes the application and delivers it directly to the Seller. 
(iii) 
Mobile devices. A digital channel launched by the Seller at the end of 2014. 
The customer completes the application using a mobile device signature. 
New customers are attracted by specialised personnel and both the Credit 
Card Agreements and the documentation is stored in digital format (subject to 
the necessary security controls and measures).  
(iv) 
Website. New customers may apply using a specific form available at the 
Seller’s website to be completed and sent to the Seller together with the 
relevant documentation to be provided by the customer (such as its identity 
card).  
However, the evolution of technology implies that entering into contracts by 
electronic means is an ever-changing process where the market trend is to offer 
customers the option to carry out the entire application process digitally; accordingly, 
one of the Seller's envisaged strategies is to develop its systems and processes so that 
the Credit Card Agreements can also be entered into in line with evolution of 
technology.  


 
 
175 
 
 
Concession stages 
(b)
The concession of a credit facility to be drawn by means of the Credit Card and 
monitoring thereof are carried out in various stages, directly or indirectly involving 
the Risk, Operation Analysis, Fraud Prevention and Recoveries Areas entrusted with: 
(i) 
Attracting customers and managing contractual documentation. 
(ii) 
Verifying the customer's solvency and deciding thereupon. 
(iii) 
Financing the credit applied for. 
(iv) 
Monitoring the operation of the Credit Card. 
Attracting customers and managing contractual documentation 
Depending on the channel in question, attracting customers requires different 
procedures and processes usually proposed by the Risks Area in conjunction with 
other areas of the Seller directly involved in such procedures and processes and which 
are approved by the Risk Committee.  
As a general rule, the information to be provided by the customer when applying for a 
Credit Card is always the same, but a distinction is made between the cases where (i) 
the customer contacts the Seller directly to apply for the Credit Card (passive process) 
and (ii) where personnel hired by the Seller make contact with the customer (active 
process).  
Normally, in the passive process, the documentation to be provided by the Credit 
Card applicant is as follows:  
(i) 
Proof of ID: valid and undamaged National Identity Card (Documento 
Nacional de Identidad) for Spanish nationals, and foreign identity card (NIF), 
passport or residence permit or certain other similar documents for foreign 
nationals.  
(ii) 
Proof of bank account: savings passbook, bill paid by direct debit (dated 
within the two (2) months prior to the date of presentation thereof to the 
Seller), nominative cheque or any other document proving ownership of the 
bank account. The bank account documentation must correspond to bank 
accounts which accept direct debits. The Credit Card applicant must be either 
the owner or authorised user of the bank account on which the direct debits 
will be made; any application where the bank account corresponds to a third 
party who is not the Credit Card applicant is automatically rejected. 
(iii) 
Proof of income: it is generally necessary to provide the following 
documentation on a case by case basis:  


 
 
176 
 
(A) 
In case of employees (trabajador por cuenta ajena): A copy of the 
most recent payslip.  
(B) 
Self-employed worker (trabajador autónomo): A copy of the 
personal income tax return (model 130-131; D100-D101) or payment 
instalments (pagos fraccionados a Hacienda).  
(C) 
Pensioners (pensionistas): pension revaluation or amount set out for 
the current year as set out in the oficial document issued by the 
Spanish Social Security (Seguridad Social).  
Apart from the above, the Risk Committee may set out from time to time different 
documentation criteria depending on the type of customer and associated risks as well 
as the channel chosen to enter into the Credit Card Agreement.  
In the active processes carried out by personnel hired by the Seller, other than in 
those cases where the customer is able to provide documentation proving his/her 
income from the outset, acceptance of the customer is based on information provided 
by the customer, which is verified through other procedures set by the Seller for the 
identification of customers; such procedures offer certainty with respect to the data 
obtained. The identification of the customer is necessary in all cases and a copy of the 
ID document (valid and undamaged National Identity Card or foreign identity card 
(NIF), passport or residence permit or certain other similar documents for foreign 
nationals) must be kept.  
The Credit Card Agreement will comply with the regulatory requirements in force at 
any given time and must be properly signed by the customer. Depending on the how 
the customer was sourced (i.e. the origination channel), the process for managing 
contractual documentation may be different.  
The customer selection criteria established by the Seller encompass the following 
basic requirements: 
(i) 
Over 18 years old with permanent residence in Spain. 
(ii) 
In gainful employment, including self-employment, or beneficiary of a 
pension. 
(iii) 
No record of payment incidents with the Seller in the past. 
(iv) 
Not included on the Asociación Nacional de Establecimientos Financieros de 
Crédito (Asnef) list. 
(v) 
In compliance with the admission criteria established in the Manual of 
Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (Manual de 


 
 
177 
 
Prevención del Blanqueo de Capitales y Financiación del Terrorismo) 
approved by the Seller. 
Assessment of the customer's solvency and adoption of a decision  
(i) 
Assessment of the customer's solvency 
All applications received, both from new customers and customers who have 
already contracted another product with the Seller, are subjected to certain 
criteria approved by the Risk Committee and that are designed to measure the 
customer's credit rating.  
Below is a summary of the variables used in the process for the approval of 
applications and establishment of Credit Limits by the Seller: 
(A) 
Admission score, measures the unknown customer's risk based on 
information provided by him/her. The score assigns a rating based on 
certain criteria that have been defined taking into account the 
information gathered: 
I. 
Periodic income. 
II. 
Other information used as a basis for verification prior to 
issuing a Credit Card (age, marital status, length of service at 
work, the time the current bank account has been held, 
homeownership, etc). 
The above criteria serve to provide an initial grid that can be used to 
score the customer on the basis of his/her theoretic risk. This grid sets 
maximum limits for the cash (contado) and credit (crédito) lines for 
the Credit Card with a view to respecting homogeneous debt ratios 
that also make it possible to reasonably cover the customer's current 
expenses. 
Depending on the rating the system provides, the score can be: A, B 
or C (with the application being rejected in the latter case). 
Depending on the final score, A or B, the system assigns a limit to 
the customer for the credit line associated with the Credit Card (pago 
a crédito), with the minimum limit at the time of execution of the 
Credit Card Agreement being EUR 150 and the maximum EUR 
9,999  
Both the variables and the criteria used as a basis to establish the 
score of the grid and the minimum and maximum limits are reviewed 
periodically and approved by the Risk Committee. However, the 


 
 
178 
 
maximum limit for the credit line associated with the Credit Card 
(pago a crédito) cannot exceed EUR 9,999. 
(B) 
Behaviour score. This is a rating similar to the admission score and 
is used to evaluate the behaviour of known customers, that is, those 
who already have contracted a product with the Seller and evaluates 
the evolution of the customer's creditworthiness. 
This behaviour score determines the possibility of extending lines of 
credit and cash and the possibility of offering new products. The 
variables used to determine the behaviour score are, among others: 
I. 
Fundability of the Credit Card. 
II. 
Payment history. 
III. 
Inclusion in solvency lists. 
IV. 
Age. 
V. 
Grant history. 
Depending on the behaviour score, the Credit Limits of the Credit 
Card may be increased to up to EUR 9,999. Both the variables and 
the criteria that serve as a basis for managing the behaviour score and 
the card use limits are reviewed periodically and approved by the 
Risk Committee. 
(C) 
Verification Rules. These are rules established as part of the Expert 
System (a computerised system that assists decision-making) that 
complement the admission and behaviour scores and are designed to 
improve the quality ratios when issuing Credit Cards. These rules are 
used to evaluate customer profiles, using variables such as age, how 
long they have been a customer, recoveries, etc. The verification 
rules analysis can give the following outcomes: 
I. 
Rejection - Automatic rejection of the Credit Card 
application. 
II. 
Approval - Temporary approval of the Credit Card 
application with the Credit Limits proposed by the admission 
or behaviour score prior to consulting the solvency lists. 
(D) 
Consulting solvency lists. Complementing the above rules, in order 
to verify and adopt a decision on issuing a Credit Card or extending a 
line of credit or cash (crédito or contado), and with the authorisation 
of the customer, certain solvency files are consulted. 


 
 
179 
 
Unless the Risk Committee expressly approves otherwise on an 
exceptional basis, inclusion on solvency lists implies rejection of the 
Credit Card application.  
(ii) 
Decision-making 
In the decision-making process, and in addition to the solvency evaluation, 
the information on the customer is analysed together with the inherent risk in 
terms of money laundering and terrorist financing (AML and TF) (in 
accordance with the criteria established in the regulations in force and the 
Manual on Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing 
approved by the Seller's Board of Directors). 
As part of the AML and TF review processes, the General Treasury of the 
Social Security (Tesorería General de la Seguridad Social or TGSS) is 
consulted to ascertain whether the declaration made or the documents 
presented by the customer regarding his/her usual source of income contain 
any inconsistency. With this consultation, apart from detecting alerts linked 
to money laundering and terrorist financing, certainty is obtained regarding 
the information and documentation gathered from the customer. 
Any inconsistency in the information and/or documentation supplied by the 
customer discovered as a result of the consultation with the TGSS will entail 
rejection of the Credit Card application regardless of the outcome of the 
safeguards established by the Seller in terms of the prevention of money 
laundering and terrorist financing. 
The adoption of the decision is based on Expert System which takes into 
consideration the evaluation of the solvency described in the foregoing point. 
The Expert System makes it possible to monitor risk and provide statistical 
validation of the appropriateness of the decision risks, gaining productivity, 
which makes it possible: 
(A) 
To inform of alerts due to the breach of rules. 
(B) 
Advocate a decision. 
(C) 
Improve and provide feedback on concession criteria. 
The Expert System contains both the concession rules and the admission and 
behaviour scores; it also includes alerts related to fraud and money 
laundering based on the knowledge of the different channels and case 
histories assessed by the Seller in past operations, providing periodic 
feedback to the Expert System and enabling the Seller to anticipate risk 
situations linked to the customer. 


 
 
180 
 
Financing of the credit applied for  
Once the decision to issue the Credit Card has been made, the Expert System 
proposes a Credit Limit for the customer to be set out in the corresponding Credit 
Card Agreement; Credit Cards are currently issued with the following Credit Limits: 
(i) 
Initial Credit Limit (upon issue of the Credit Card): From EUR 150 to EUR 
9,999.  
(ii) 
Subsequent increases in the Credit Limit: up to a maximum of EUR 25,000. 
The above Credit Limits are reviewed periodically by the Risk Committee. 
The Credit Card is sent to the customer's address by mail together with a welcome 
letter and basic explanatory documentation on its functioning. The customer receives 
the PIN number in a separate mailing, which enables him/her to use the Credit Card. 
Monitoring the operation of the Credit Card 
With a view to monitoring its exposure to credit risk, the Seller has established 
different indicators and statistics in the departments involved in the Credit Card issue 
process as explained section 3.7.2.13 of the Additional Building Block. The analysis 
and monitoring of the indicators and statistics related to credit risk are the 
responsibility of the Risk Area and Risk Committee. The objective is to ensure 
correct implementation and effectiveness of the defined risk criteria. 
 
Amendments to the Credit Policies 
(c)
The Seller may change its Credit Policies if such change is made applicable to the 
comparable segment of revolving credit accounts owned and serviced by the Seller. 
2.2.8. Indication of representations and warranties given to the Fund relating to the

2.2.9. Default of Conformity of the Receivables - Breach of Representations and

2.2.9.1. 
Breach of Eligibility Criteria and remedies 
 
General Provisions 
(a)
When consenting to acquire the Eligible Receivables on each Purchase Date, the 
Management Company, acting for and on behalf of the Fund, will take into 
consideration, as an essential and determining condition for its consent, the Seller's 
representations and warranties. 
The Management Company will verify the compliance of certain or all of the 
Receivables with part or all of the Eligibility Criteria at the latest on the Confirmation 
Date immediately following the Selection Date with respect to Initial Transfers in an 
appropriate manner to ensure such compliance. No verification shall be made by the 
Management Company in relation to Receivables transferred in the context of 
Additional Transfers. In any event, the responsibility for the non-compliance of the 
Receivables transferred by the Seller to the Fund with the Eligibility Criteria as at the 
applicable Purchase Date, will at all-time remain with the Seller only (and the 
Management Company shall under no circumstance be liable therefor) and the 
Management Company will therefore rely only on the representations made, and on 
the warranties given, by the Seller regarding those Purchased Receivables. 
 
Remedies in case of non-compliance 
(b)
If the Management Company or the Seller becomes aware for any reason whatsoever 
that either (i) any of the representations or warranties given or made by the Seller in 
relation to the Purchased Receivables (both in the context of Initial Transfers or 
Additional Transfers) were false or incorrect on the relevant Purchase Date or (ii) one 
or several Eligibility Criteria were not met on the relevant Purchase Date, the 
Management Company or the Seller, as applicable, will promptly inform the other 
party of such non-compliance by providing a letter containing an electronic list with 
the Non-Compliant Receivables.  
The Seller undertakes to remedy such non-compliance by repurchasing such Non-
Compliant Receivables, together with, if applicable, any other outstanding Purchased 
Receivables arisen from the same Client Account so that the total balance under the 
relevant Client Account is repurchased, under the following conditions: 
(i) 
the repurchase shall be made on any Repurchase Date prior to the second 
Cut-Off Date following the date on which the non-compliance of that Non-
Compliant Receivable was notified by a party to the other party (with 


 
 
190 
 
economic effects between the Seller and the Fund from the relevant Effective 
Repurchase Date, from which the Seller shall be entitled to any amounts of 
principal, interest, fees (other than Interchange Fees), default interest (if 
applicable), penalties, Insurance Indemnifications and any other related 
payments received from the corresponding Repurchased Receivables as of 
the relevant Repurchase Date). 
(ii) 
The amount payable by the Seller (Non-Compliant Repurchase Amount) 
will be equal to: 
(A) 
the then aggregate Outstanding Principal Balance of each Non-
Compliant Receivable and any other outstanding Purchased 
Receivables arisen from the same Client Account; plus  
(B) 
any accrued and unpaid outstanding interest thereon until (but 
excluding) the Effective Repurchase Date, 
as of such Effective Repurchase Date. Payment will be effected on the 
immediately following Calculation Date.  
In order to achieve certainty of the date of the retransfer of the Non-Compliant 
Receivables for the purposes of article 1,526 of the Civil Code, on a monthly basis (if 
applicable) the Management Company will electronically forward to the CNMV the 
data file regarding the repurchased Receivables using the CIFRADOC/CNMV 
service. 
Notwithstanding the above, at any time and for any reason, the Management 
Company is unable to use the CIFRADOC/CNMV service, the Seller and the 
Management Company will appear before the Spanish Notary designated by the 
Seller for the purposes of raising to the status of a Spanish Public Document any 
repurchase of Receivables made hereunder (provided that all cost and expenses 
arising from any such notarisations shall be borne by the Seller). 
If the Seller is unable to repurchase according to the above, the Fund will keep 
ownership of the relevant Non-Compliant Receivables and any other Purchased 
Receivables arising from such Non-Compliant Client Accounts, and the Seller shall 
indemnify the Fund in an amount equal to the Non-Compliant Repurchase Amount 
on the applicable Calculation Date. 
Any Non-Compliant Repurchase Amount paid to the Fund in accordance with the 
above will be exclusively allocated to the Fund and be credited to the General 
Account and form part of the Available Collections. 
In addition, and in any case, the Seller shall indemnify in full and hold harmless the 
Fund from and against any and all damages and claims (whether or not successful, 
compromised or settled), actions, demands, proceedings or judgments which may be 


 
 
191 
 
instituted, made, threatened, alleged, asserted or established from time to time in any 
jurisdiction initiated by the Borrowers or any successors therefrom in connection with 
the Non-Compliant Receivables and from all damages which the Fund may suffer or 
incur from time to time (including all costs and expenses reasonably incurred in the 
defence of the interest of the Fund, and any direct and indirect tax implications that 
such indemnity payment may trigger for the Fund including, but not limited to, any 
corporate income tax that shall be levied on the Fund as a consequence of collecting 
such amounts). 
For these purposes, Non-Compliant Receivable means any Purchased Receivable 
which does not comply with the Eligibility Criteria on the relevant Purchase Date. 
 
Limits of the remedies in case of non-conformity 
(c)
The remedies set out in this section 2.2.9 are the sole remedies available to the Fund 
in respect of the non-compliance of any Purchased Receivable with the Eligibility 
Criteria. Under no circumstance may the Management Company request an additional 
indemnity from the Seller relating to a breach of any such representations or 
warranties.  
To the extent that any loss arises as a result of a matter which is not covered by those 
representations and warranties, the loss will remain with the Fund. In particular, but 
without limitation, the Seller has given and will give no warranty as to the ongoing 
solvency of the Borrowers of the Purchased Receivables. 
Furthermore, the representations and warranties given or made by the Seller in 
relation to the compliance of the Receivables with the Eligibility Criteria shall not 
entitle the Noteholders to assert any claim directly against the Seller, the Management 
Company having the exclusive competence under Law 5/2015 to represent the Fund, 
and more generally, the Fund as against third parties and in any legal proceedings. 
2.2.10. Insurance policies in relation to the Receivables  
The Seller has not entered into any insurance policy in relation to the Receivables 
(without prejudice to its potential designation as beneficiary under the Insurance 
Policies entered into by the Borrowers as described in section 2.2 above under the 
heading “Insurance”).  
2.2.11. Information on the debtors where the securitized assets include obligations of 
five or fewer debtors which are legal persons, or if a single debtor accounts for 
more than 20% of the assets, or where a single debtor accounts for a material 
portion of the assets

are not fully satisfied (provided that the Management Company shall make its best 
efforts to notify the Seller as soon as possible in advance should it become aware that 
such suspension may occur) on the applicable Purchase Date, the purchase of Eligible 
Receivables by the Fund shall be suspended.  
The Seller shall sell such Eligible Receivables in the context of Additional Transfers 
on the first Business Day on which such transfer is possible, provided that the

Purchase Dates. 
 
Transfer of Receivables on the Fund Incorporation Date 
(h)
Notwithstanding the above, the transfer of Eligible Receivables to be made on the 
Fund Incorporation Date (for such purposes, a Purchase Date and an Effective 
Purchase Date) will be effected in the Deed of Incorporation of the Fund. To this 
effect, the Deed of Incorporation of the Fund shall include the necessary provisions to 
carry out such transfer (including the relevant Seller’s declaration of the fulfillment of 


 
 
212 
 
all the representations and warranties and the Conditions Precedent to the Purchase of 
Receivables have been satisfied). 
3.3.1.3. 
Effects of the purchase of the Receivables and Seller's guarantees 
On each Purchase Date, the Receivables shall be sold and transferred by the Seller to the 
Management Company, for and on behalf of the Fund, with (i) the statutory guarantee of the 
existence and legitimacy (legitimidad) of such Receivables as per articles 1,529 of the Civil 
Code and 348 of the Commercial Code, (ii) the warranty as to their conformity on the 
applicable Purchase date with the Eligibility Criteria and (iii) the undertakings in the Master 
Receivables Sale and Purchase Agreement. 
This notwithstanding, the transfer of the Eligible Receivables shall have economic effects 
between the Seller and the Fund from the Effective Purchase Date.  
The Seller and the Management Company, acting for and on behalf of the Fund, expressly 
agree that any Receivable that does not comply with the Eligibility Criteria on the applicable 
Purchase Date shall be deemed to be a non-compliant Receivable (each, a Non-Compliant 
Receivable). 
The Seller undertakes not to sell and transfer to the Management Company, acting in the 
name and on behalf of the Fund, any Non-Compliant Receivable. To this end, the Seller 
undertakes to carry out such necessary acts in order not to include any Non-Compliant 
Receivable in any Sale Offer. 
3.3.1.4. 
Purchase Price, Effective Purchase Price and Deferred Purchase Price of the 
Eligible Receivables 
The Fund shall pay to the Seller, on any Monthly Payment Date, the Purchase Price of the 
Eligible Receivables transferred to the Fund in the context of Initial Transfers and Additional 
Transfers on each Purchase Dates during the Purchase Period preceding such Monthly 
Payment Date. 
The Effective Purchase Price and the Deferred Purchase Price shall be determined on each 
Calculation Date prior to the corresponding Monthly Payment Date by the Management 
Company on an aggregate basis for all Eligible Receivables purchased by the Fund during the 
preceding Purchase Period, and will not be individually allocated to any particular Purchased 
Receivables, provided that the sum of the Effective Purchase Price and the Deferred Purchase 
Price for all Eligible Receivables purchased on any given Purchase Period will be equal to 
100% of the aggregate Outstanding Principal Balance of such Eligible Receivables as of the 
applicable Effective Purchase Dates. 
The Purchase Price will be paid as follows: 


 
 
213 
 
 
the Effective Purchase Price of the Eligible Receivables purchased during a Purchase 
(a)
Period shall be paid on the immediately following Monthly Payment Date subject to 
the applicable Priority of Payments; and/or  
 
the Deferred Purchase Price shall be paid on each Monthly Payment Date following 
(b)
the Monthly Payment Date on which the Effective Purchase Price of such Eligible 
Receivables has been or should have been paid subject to the applicable Priority of 
Payments. 
The Deferred Purchase Price is the portion of the Purchase Price which is not paid by the 
Fund to the Seller for the transfer of certain Eligible Receivables on the Monthly Payment 
Dates following the applicable Purchase Period.  
During the Programme Revolving Period (if the Residual Principal Deficiency Ledger is in 
debit at the preceding Calculation Date), the Programme Amortisation Period and the 
Programme Accelerated Amortisation Period, the purchase of new Eligible Receivables will 
be funded through the Deferred Purchase Price (and/or with the Available Distribution 
Amount, if any, in accordance with the relevant Priority of Payments). 
For clarification purposes, the Deferred Purchase Price is not limited and could be used to 
fund the total amount of the Purchase Price of the Eligible Receivables purchased by the Fund 
during the Programme Revolving Period (if the Residual Principal Deficiency Ledger is in 
debit at the preceding Calculation Date), the Programme Amortisation Period and the 
Programme Accelerated Amortisation Period. 
If a Deferred Purchase Price is recorded by the Management Company on a Monthly Payment 
Date, the Management Company and the Seller hereby acknowledge and agree that such 
Deferred Purchase Price is only a term for the payment of this portion of the Purchase Price 
by the Fund to the Seller and shall not constitute a ground to rescind (resolver or rescindir) 
the transfer of the corresponding Eligible Receivable. Such Deferred Purchase Price shall be 
added to the existing Deferred Purchase Prices which remain unpaid as of such Monthly 
Payment Date (if any) and therefore increase the outstanding amount of Aggregate Deferred 
Purchase Price. 
The Fund shall pay to the Seller interest (the DPP Interest) on the outstanding Aggregate 
Deferred Purchase Price in accordance with the following provisions: 
 
DPP Interest will be calculated by the Management Company on each Calculation 
(a)
Date. 
 
The amount of DPP Interest payable to the Seller (the Aggregate DPP Interest 
(b)
Amount) will be equal to the product of: 
(i) 
the relevant Seller Share Interest Rate;  


 
 
214 
 
(ii) 
the Aggregate Deferred Purchase Price as of the preceding Monthly Payment 
Date; and  
(iii) 
the day count fraction corresponding to the ratio between (i) the actual 
effective days in each Interest Accrual Period and (ii) a 360-day year,  
and rounding the resultant figure to the nearest cent.  
For these purposes, the term while there is a Deferred Purchase Price shall be divided 
into consecutive interest accrual periods (each of them, an Interest Accrual Period) 
comprising the days effectively elapsed between each Monthly Payment Date, 
including in each Interest Accrual Period the initial Monthly Payment Date and 
excluding the final Monthly Payment Date. The first Interest Accrual Period shall 
commence on the date on which there is a Deferred Purchase Price amount and end 
on the immediately following Monthly Payment Date.  
 
The Aggregate DPP Interest Amount will be paid in accordance with and subject to 
(c)
the Priority of Payments.  
 
Any Aggregate DPP Interest Amounts which have not been paid to the Seller due to 
(d)
shortage of Available Distribution Amounts will be paid on the following Monthly 
Payment Date on which the Available Distribution Amounts permit said payment 
according to the applicable Priority of Payments. Such amounts will be paid in 
preference to the Aggregate DPP Interest Amounts payable on said Monthly Payment 
Date. The Aggregate DPP Interest Amounts owed to the Seller that remain unpaid 
according to the provisions of the prior paragraphs will not accrue default interest in 
favour of the Seller. 
 
Any Aggregate DPP Interest Amounts not paid on the Fund Liquidation Date shall be 
(e)
cancelled and deemed as a final loss for the Seller.

219 
 
under such Client Account which are not Purchased Receivables (the Non Purchased 
Receivables and together with the Purchased Receivables arising from the same Client 
Account, the Common Receivables), the Seller and the Fund will have a joint ownership 
right on any payments made by the relevant Borrower with respect to such Client Account.  
In such circumstance, the Seller's rights on any payments of principal, interest and any other 
amounts paid by the Borrower under the Non Purchased Receivables will be subordinated to 
the rights of the Fund to receive such payments and such amounts under the Purchased 
Receivables arising from the same Client Account (unless instructed by the relevant Borrower 
to allocate any payment to any portion of the abovementioned Receivables at the time of 
making the relevant payment; for instance, in a store of the Carrefour group).

(including any arrears and penalties thereon) received by the Servicer from the 
relevant Borrower and such amounts shall constitute Available Collections;

Available Collections; and 
 
the Seller hereby waives any rights to retain or be retransferred by the Servicer any 
(c)
such amounts paid by a Borrower in connection with the Common Receivables and 
undertakes to transfer any and all amounts received by it to the Fund. 
The priority allocation rule sets out herein will apply: 
 
to any Client Account for which a Purchased Receivable has been transferred by the 
(a)
Seller to the Fund; 
 
during the Programme Revolving Period, the Programme Amortisation Period and the 
(b)
Programme Accelerated Amortisation Period, as from the Purchase Date of such 
Purchased Receivable in the context of an Initial Transfer and until the earlier of (i) 
the date on which all Purchased Receivables held by the Fund in respect of such 
Client Account is fully repaid or (ii) the last Settlement Date preceding the Fund 
Liquidation Date. 
3.3.1.7. 
Contractual Documents and Files

Documents relating to the Purchased Receivables, (ii) establish appropriate custody 
procedures and an independent internal ongoing control of such procedures, and (iii) make 
available promptly to the Servicer (or the Replacement Servicer, as the case may be) all such 
Contractual Documents that the Servicer (or the Replacement Servicer, as the case may be) 
may require in the exercise of its duties, including, without limitation, for the purposes of 
enforcing the rights of the Fund under the Eligible Receivables.

Indemnifications payable to the Seller under any Insurance Policies entered into by the 
relevant Borrower in connection with any Credit Card Agreement.  
The Seller shall: 
 
notify the Fund as soon as it becomes aware of the existence of any Insurance 
(a)
Indemnifications payable under the Insurance Policies; and  
 
transfer such Insurance Indemnifications: 
(b)
(i) 
firstly, to the Collections Accounts promptly and in any case within two (2) 
Business Days after receipt in the relevant Seller’s accounts (provided that 
such amounts are received within banking hours on the Business Day they 
are received by the Seller, otherwise the following Business Day), and  
(ii) 
then, once received into the Collections Account, to the General Account 
promptly and in any case within one (1) Business Day following receipt of 
the amounts into the Collections Accounts (provided that such amounts are 
received within banking hours on the Business Day they are received into the 
Collections Accounts, otherwise the following Business Day),

contractual amendments between the Seller and the Borrowers, to the extent 
permitted by: 
(i) 
the applicable laws and regulations; and/or 
(ii) 
the provisions below. 
 
Permitted Amendments 
(b)
(i) 
The Seller shall be entitled to agree to any amendments to the Credit Card 
Agreements or the Standard Forms if such amendment (A) is the mandatory 
result of a final court’s resolution, (B) is imposed by any competent 
administrative or regulatory authority, (C) affects the interest rate or the fees, 
the instalment due date, the instalment amount, the maximum authorised 
credit amount and/or implies the application of grace periods for payment of 
interest, to the extent permitted by the terms of such Credit Card Agreement, 
the usual Credit Policies and the Servicing Policies or (D) is required by 
applicable laws or regulations. 
(ii) 
Furthermore, the Seller shall be entitled to agree amendments to a Credit 
Card Agreement as a result of the renegotiations and compromises reached 
with the Borrowers in accordance with section 3.7.2.12 of the Additional 
Building Block.  
(iii) 
Other than in those cases foreseen in (i) and (ii) above, the Seller may amend 
the terms and conditions of any Credit Card Agreement and the Standard 
Forms from which the outstanding Purchased Receivables or non-transferred 
Eligible Receivables arise after having delivered a prior written notice for 
information purposes to the Management Company and the Relevant Rating 
Agencies (including the terms which may be subject to contractual 
amendments described above), provided that: 
(A) 
such amendment is also applied to any comparable segment of credit 
card agreements owned and/or serviced by the Seller and which have 
the same characteristics as, or substantially similar to, the Credit Card 
Agreements from which the Eligible Receivables derive; and 
(B) 
such amendment would not challenge the perfection of the transfer to 
the Fund of any outstanding Purchased Receivables nor the potential 
transfer of any Eligible Receivables (to be transferred to the Fund) in 
the context of an Additional Transfer.  


 
 
222 
 
The failure by the Seller to deliver a prior written notice for information 
purposes to the Management Company and the Relevant Rating Agencies

complies with provisions above. 
 
Breach of Undertakings and Remedies 
(c)
In the event that the Seller (i) amends the Credit Card Agreement or (ii) amends, 
waives or renegotiates the terms of any Purchased Receivables in breach of the

3.7.2.12 of the Additional Building Block), the Seller will repurchase such 
Receivables, under the following conditions: 
(i) 
The repurchase shall be made on any Repurchase Date prior to the second 
Cut-Off Date following the date on which the waiver or the new terms of that 
Receivable are applicable (with economic effects between the Seller and the 
Fund from the relevant Effective Repurchase Date, from which the Seller 
shall be entitled to any amounts of principal, interest, fees (other than 
Interchange Fees), default interest (if applicable), penalties, Insurance 
Indemnifications and any other related payments received from the 
corresponding Repurchased Receivables as of the relevant Repurchase Date).  
(ii) 
The amount payable as a consequence of such repurchase will be equal to: 
(A) 
the then aggregate Outstanding Principal Balance of each relevant 
Receivable (before such amendment, waiver or renegotiation) and 
any other outstanding Purchased Receivables arisen from the same 
Client Account; plus  
(B) 
any accrued and unpaid outstanding interest thereon until (but 
excluding) the Effective Repurchase Date, 
as of such Effective Repurchase Date. Payment will be effected on the 
immediately following Calculation Date.  
If the Seller is unable to repurchase the relevant Receivables in accordance with the 
above, the Fund will keep the ownership of the relevant Receivables and the Seller 
shall indemnify the Fund in an amount equal to the amount payable under paragraph 
(ii) above on the applicable Repurchase Date.  
Any amount paid to the Fund under these provisions will be exclusively allocated to 
the Fund and be credited to the General Account and form part of the Available 
Collections.

Purchased Receivables (including the case where such renegotiation is made by SFC 
acting as the Servicer) equal to the forgiveness of whole or part of any Outstanding 
Principal Balances of such Purchased Receivables. Such amount shall be paid by the 
Seller to the Fund on or prior the Calculation Date.  
Dilutions means, on each Determination Date, in respect of the Collection Period 
immediately preceding such Determination Date, the Outstanding Principal Balance 
of any given outstanding Purchased Receivables cancelled by the Seller (in part or in 
full) for the benefit of the Borrowers, as the result of any return, rebate, deduction, 
retention, undue restitution, legal set-off (compensación legal), contractual set-off 
(compensation convencional), judicial set-off (compensation judicial), fraudulent or 
counterfeit transactions, or in respect of merchandise which was refused or returned 
by a Borrower.  
 
Limits of the remedies 
(e)
The repurchase procedure set out in the preceding paragraphs and the payment to the 
Fund of the Seller Dilutions shall be the only remedies available to the Management 
Company in the event of (i) a waiver or a renegotiation of the terms of any 
Receivables which would result in the breach by the Seller, in its capacity as Servicer, 
of its undertakings or (i) the amendment by the Seller of the Credit Card Agreements

during the Programme Revolving Period and during the Programme Amortisation 
(d)
Period, any outstanding Purchased Receivables deriving from Performing Client 
Accounts if the Outstanding Principal Balance of all outstanding Purchased 
Receivables deriving from Performing Client Accounts held by the Fund as of the 
relevant prior Cut-Off Date (taking into account for that purpose, the contemplated 
Receivables purchased by the Fund in the context of Initial Transfers and such 
contemplated repurchased by the Seller to be made on or before such Repurchase 
Date) were higher than the Minimum Portfolio Amount.  
3.3.1.12. 
Repurchase Procedure  
Provided that an Optional Repurchase Event referred to in paragraphs (a) to (c) of section 
3.3.1.11 has occurred: 
 
The Seller may inform the Management Company of the occurrence of such Optional 
(a)
Repurchase Event by delivering a written request to the Management Company on 
the Determination Date. 
 
On the Selection Date, the Seller shall then select the Receivables to be retransferred 
(b)
on the contemplated Repurchase Date, which will include, if applicable, any other 
outstanding Purchased Receivables arising from the same Client Accounts so the total 
balance under the relevant Client Account(s) is repurchased. 
 
On such Selection Date, the Seller shall send to the Management Company the list of 
(c)
the corresponding Client Accounts from which the Receivables to be repurchased 
derive (the Repurchase File). 
 
As of the close of business on the Confirmation Date, the Seller will proceed to mark 
(d)
the selected receivables as Repurchased Receivables on its IT system with effect as 
from the start of business of the next calendar day (the Effective Repurchase Date).  
 
On the Repurchase Date the Seller will deliver to the Management Company a 
(e)
written repurchase request (each, a Repurchase Request) and a file with the list of 
repurchased Receivables, which would serve for the calculation by the Management 
Company of the Aggregate Repurchase Price of the Repurchased Receivables.  


 
 
225 
 
Provided that the Optional Repurchase Event referred to in paragraph (d) of section 3.3.1.11 
has occurred: 
 
The Seller may inform the Management Company of the occurrence of such Optional 
(a)
Repurchase Event by delivering a written request to the Management Company on 
the Determination Date immediately preceding the contemplated Repurchase Date. 
 
The Seller shall notify the Management Company before 12h00 (CET) on the 
(b)
Determination Date its intention to exercise any repurchase option and a target 
repurchase amount (together with any required information, if necessary) (the Target 
Amount) of Purchased Receivables to be retransferred by the Fund (the 
Contemplated Repurchased Receivables) on the Repurchase Date as contemplated 
in the relevant Repurchase Request (corresponding to the immediately following 
Purchase Date in respect of Initial Transfers). 
 
On the Selection Date, the Seller shall select randomly the Receivables to be 
(c)
retransferred on the contemplated Repurchase Date, which will include, if applicable, 
any other outstanding Purchased Receivables arisen from the same Credit Card 
Agreements, provided that:  
(i) 
the aggregate amount of the Repurchase Price of such Receivables shall not 
be greater than the Target Amount as notified by the Seller; and  
(ii) 
the excess (if any) of: 
(A) 
the Target Amount as notified by the Seller; over 
(B) 
the expected Aggregate Repurchase Price of the Receivables selected 
randomly by the Seller  
shall not be greater than EUR 50,000.00. 
 
On such Selection Date, the Seller shall send to the Management Company the 
(d)
Repurchase File. 
 
The Management Company shall confirm on the Confirmation Date that it agrees 
(e)
with the selection and designation of the Purchased Receivables to be repurchased 
made by the Seller.  
 
As of the close of business on the Confirmation Date, the Seller will proceed to mark 
(f)
the selected receivables on its IT system with effect as from the start of business of 
the Effective Repurchase Date.  
 
On the Repurchase Date the Seller will deliver to the Management Company a 
(g)
Repurchase Request together with a file with the list of repurchased Receivables, 
which would serve for the calculation by the Management Company of the Aggregate 


 
 
226 
 
Repurchase Price of the Repurchased Receivables which must be paid by the Seller 
by transfer to the Fund’s General Account on such Repurchase Date.  
Common terms applicable to the repurchase procedures 
Each Repurchase Request shall be irrevocable and binding on the Seller when delivered to the 
Management Company. 
The Management Company shall refuse the exercise of the option by the Seller if the 
Repurchase Conditions Precedent set out in the next section are not met.  
If the Repurchase Conditions Precedent are met, then the Management Company shall 
countersign the Repurchase Request in proof of its acceptance and deliver it to the Seller no 
later than on the Repurchase Date.  
If a Repurchase Request is not accepted by the Management Company on the relevant 
Repurchase Date in accordance with the above, such Repurchase Request shall automatically 
lapse with no additional formalities. Notwithstanding any de-marking of the selected 
outstanding Purchased Receivables and the related Client Accounts made by the Seller in its 
IT system prior to the cancellation of the repurchased procedure, the Seller shall be obliged to 
proceed with the necessary manual adjustments and shall calculate and pay, under the 
supervision of the Management Company, to the Fund any amounts of Available Collections 
and Insurance Premia which would have been paid by it to the Fund if the repurchase 
procedure would not have been cancelled. 
After the acceptance of the Repurchase Request by the Management Company: 
 
the Seller shall repurchase all outstanding Receivables deriving from the relevant 
(a)
Client Account(s) specified in the related Repurchase File (being specified that for 
the avoidance of doubt any drawing which has not been transferred in the context of 
an Additional Transfer by the Seller to the Fund will not be subject to any 
repurchase);  
 
the Seller will not be entitled to transfer new Receivable(s) in the context of 
(b)
Additional Transfers deriving from such Client Accounts which are the subject to the 
repurchase by the Seller as from the Effective Repurchase Date (unless the Seller 
transfers, on any further Purchase Date, new Receivables deriving from such Client 
Account in the context of an Initial Transfer); and 
 
the retransfer shall have economic effects between the Seller and the Fund from the 
(c)
Effective Repurchase Date; therefore the Seller shall be entitled from the Effective 
Repurchase Date to any amounts of principal, interest, fees (other than Interchange 
Fees), default interest (if applicable), penalties, Insurance Indemnifications and any 
other related payments received from the corresponding Repurchased Receivables as 
of the relevant Repurchase Date. Any collection received by the Fund (if any) on or 


 
 
227 
 
after the Effective Repurchase Date in relation with such Repurchased Receivables 
will be repaid by the Fund to the Seller. 
The retransfer procedure described herein may be updated or amended from time to time 
between the Seller and the Management Company in order to take into account any upgrade 
or update of the Seller’s information systems, provided that (i) such update or amendment 
will have no adverse effect on the Fund or the rights of the noteholders or the funders of the 
Fund, (ii) prior written notification will be delivered by the Management Company and the 
Seller to the Relevant Rating Agencies. No amendment to the Deed of Incorporation of the 
Fund shall be required unless the amendment proposed by the Seller and the Management 
Company has a negative effect on the Fund or the rights of the noteholders or the funders of 
the Fund.  
In order to achieve certainty of the date of the retransfer of the Repurchased Receivables for 
the purposes of article 1,526 of the Civil Code, on a monthly basis (if applicable) the 
Management Company will electronically forward to the CNMV the Repurchase Request 
signed by both the Seller and the Management together with a data file regarding the 
Repurchased Receivables using the CIFRADOC/CNMV service. 
Notwithstanding the above, at any time and for any reason, the Management Company is 
unable to use the CIFRADOC/CNMV service, the Seller and the Management Company will 
appear before the Spanish Notary designated by the Seller for the purposes of raising to the 
status of a Spanish Public Document any repurchase of Receivables made hereunder 
(provided that all cost and expenses arising from any such notarisations shall be borne by the 
Seller). 
For these purposes: 
Aggregate Repurchase Price means, in relation to all the Repurchased Receivables to be 
repurchased on a Repurchase Date: 
 
the aggregate of the Repurchase Prices of such Repurchased Receivables; plus 
(a)
 
all additional, specific, direct and indirect, costs and expenses incurred by the Fund in 
(b)
respect of the repurchase of such Repurchased Receivables and previously approved 
by the Seller excluding, for the avoidance of any double counting, any item already 
included in the Repurchase Price. 
3.3.1.13. 
Repurchase Conditions Precedent 
The repurchase of the Contemplated Repurchase Receivables shall only occur on the 
Repurchase Date if the following repurchase conditions precedent (the Repurchase 
Conditions Precedent) are met: 
 


 
 
228 
 
 
General conditions for all Optional Repurchase Events:  
(a)
(i) 
satisfaction of the Minimum Portfolio Amount Condition as of the 
Calculation Date;  
(ii) 
no Fund Liquidation Event has occurred; and 
(iii) 
the Management Company is not aware that a Seller Event of Default has 
occurred and is continuing.  
 
Specific conditions for the Optional Repurchase Event referred to in paragraph (d) of 
(b)
section 3.3.1.11:  
(i) 
such repurchase of the Contemplated Repurchased Receivables does not 
result in the occurrence of a Revolving Termination Event (if the Repurchase 
Date occurs during the Programme Revolving Period) or an Accelerated 
Amortisation Event (if the Repurchase Date occurs during the Programme 
Revolving Period or the Programme Amortisation Period); and 
(ii) 
on the relevant Calculation Date, the Management Company has determined 
that the Residual Principal Deficiency Ledger will not be in debit on the next 
Monthly Payment Date after the application of the Interest Priority of 
Payments. 
3.3.1.14. 
Aggregate Repurchase Price 
The Aggregate Repurchase Price of the Repurchased Receivables shall be calculated by the 
Management Company on each Calculation Date and shall be paid by the Seller to the Fund 
at the latest on the Repurchase Date. 
3.3.2. Optional Re-Transfer of all Purchased Receivables upon the Liquidation of the 
Fund  
The Seller shall have the right (but not the obligation) to repurchase from the Fund all the 
outstanding Purchased Receivables remaining among the assets of the Fund in the context of 
the liquidation of the Fund following the occurrence of a Fund Liquidation Event in 
accordance with the terms set out in section 4.4.4 of the Registration Document. 
3.3.3. Description of the rights conferred upon the Fund for the acquisition of the 
Receivables 
The Fund, as legal holder of the Purchased Receivables will hold the rights generally 
recognized by applicable law and in the Purchased Receivables.  
Specifically, and without limitation, the transfer of the Receivables will include all accessory 
rights in accordance with the provisions of article 1,528 of the Civil Code; thus, it will give 
the Fund the following rights as regards the Purchased Receivables:  


 
 
229 
 
 
all amounts due for the repayment of the principal of the Purchased Receivables; 
(a)
 
all amounts due for the ordinary interest on the Purchased Receivables; 
(b)
 
all amounts due for the default interest (if applicable) on the Purchased Receivables; 
(c)
 
all fees due under the Credit Card Agreement (other than Interchange Fees);  
(d)
 
all amounts received from the repurchase of Purchased Receivables by the Seller, in 
(e)
accordance with the provisions of section 3.3.1.11 of this Additional Building Block; 
and 
 
all potential rights or indemnities in favour of the Seller including, without limitation, 
(f)
any Insurance Indemnifications. 
All the above mentioned rights will accrue in favour of the Fund as from the Effective 
Purchase Date.  
Subject to that set out in section 2.2 of the Additional Building Block with respect to fees 
charged to the Borrower and unpaid insurance premiums amounting to Drawings, any 
amounts corresponding to the insurance premium payable by the Borrower in connection with 
the Insurance Policies shall not be transferred to the Fund as the Seller does only collect them 
in the name and on behalf of the relevant insurance company. 
For the avoidance of doubt, pursuant to section 2.2 of the Additional Building Block in case 
of returned purchases, any amounts to be reimbursed (including, if applicable, interest) by the 
Seller to the relevant Borrowers will need to be reimbursed by the Fund to the Seller on the 
next Settlement Date, such payment not being subject to the Priority of Payments. 
3.3.4. Notification to the Borrowers and Insurance Companies 
The Borrowers and the Insurance Companies shall be notified of the transfer of the Purchased 
Receivables as soon as practicable: 
 
upon the occurrence of the Servicer Termination Event;  
(a)
 
in any other circumstances where the Servicer, with the prior consent of the 
(b)
Management Company, considers such notification necessary or desirable for the 
maximisation of the recoveries under the Receivables or the Insurance 
Indemnifications.  
In any of the scenarios described above, the Management Company shall be entitled to 
request the Data Protection Agent to provide the Decoding Key of the Encrypted Data File in 
order to be able to access to the data included therein. 
The Management Company shall be entitled to notify (or cause to be notified) the Borrowers 
and the Insurance Companies to make all payments in relation to the Purchased Receivables 


 
 
230 
 
or the Insurance Indemnifications, as applicable, directly on the General Account or on any 
other Fund's substitute bank account held and operated by any authorised credit institution 
having the Account Bank Required Ratings in the event of the substitution and replacement of 
the Issuer Accounts Bank pursuant to the terms set out in section 3.4.5 of the Additional 
Building Block. 
Any costs and expenses arising from the notification of the transfer of the Purchased 
Receivables upon the occurrence of a Servicer Termination Event shall be borne by the 
retiring Servicer. Notwithstanding this, in order to avoid any delays, the Management 
Company, at the expense of the Fund, may advance any such costs and expenses and request 
subsequently their reimbursement by the retiring Servicer.  
Regarding such costs and expenses arising from the notification of the transfer of the 
Purchased Receivables according to paragraph (b) above, they shall be borne by the Fund. 
In addition, if and when the Servicer is requested to confirm or state the capacity in which it is 
administering and servicing the Purchased Receivables and related matters by any Borrower 
or any third party (including a Spanish court) and to whom the Servicer is obliged by law to 
disclose such information, the Servicer shall confirm or state that it is acting in its capacity as 
servicer of the Purchased Receivables and related matters as agent for and on behalf of the 
Fund and not on its own behalf.  
Pursuant to articles 1,527 and 1,198 of the Civil Code, until the moment of notification to the 
Borrowers and/or the Insurance Companies, as applicable, (i) they will be discharged of their 
payment obligations by paying the Seller, and (ii) the Borrowers and/or the Insurance 
Companies, as applicable, will have the right to set off against the Seller their payment 
obligations existing before the transfer and those which came into existence after the transfer 
until the date they were notified. If notice of the transfer is served on the Borrower and/or the 
Insurance Company and any of them opposes to the transfer, then the Borrower and/or the 
Insurance Company, as applicable, will only keep the right to set off payment obligations 
existing before the notice but not those which are posterior. 
3.4. 
Explanation of the Flow of Funds 
3.4.1. How the cash flow from the assets will meet the Fund’s obligations to its 
creditors 
In accordance with this section, the Fund will attend all payment obligations derived from the 
Notes of each Notes Series and its remaining liabilities by applying the cash flows generated 
by the Receivables and any other applicable rights of the Fund.  
The Fund will enjoy additional protection and enhancement mechanisms that are described in 
this section. These mechanisms will be applied in accordance with the rules of this Base 
Prospectus and their purpose is to ensure that the cash flows of the Fund are sufficient to 
attend its payment obligations in accordance with the relevant Priority of Payments set out in 
section 3.4.7.2 of the Additional Building Block.  


 
 
231 
 
All payments of principal and interest (and arrears, if any) on the Notes of any Note Series 
shall be made in accordance with the rules of this Base Prospectus and the relevant Priority of 
Payments set out in section 3.4.7.2 of the Additional Building Block. 
3.4.2. Ledgers 
3.4.2.1. 
Principal Deficiency Ledger 
During the Programme Revolving Period and the Programme Amortisation Period and with 
respect to any Collection Period, a principal deficiency ledger (the Principal Deficiency 
Ledger) comprising three sub-ledgers, namely the Class A Principal Deficiency Ledger, the 
Class B Principal Deficiency Ledger and the Residual Principal Deficiency Ledger 
respectively, shall be established by the Management Company, acting for and on behalf of 
the Fund in order to keep record of any shortfall or deficiency between Outstanding Principal 
Balances of the Performing Client Accounts, and the Principal Amount Outstanding of the 
Notes and the SICF Principal Amount Outstanding, subject to the allocation rule described 
below. During the Programme Revolving Period and the Programme Amortisation Period and 
with respect to any Collection Period, the Management Company shall record on any 
Calculation Date as debit entries in the Principal Deficiency Ledger any new Default Amount 
on the Purchased Receivables in respect to the previous Collection Period and the reallocation 
of principal receipts to payment of interest made in accordance with item (1) of the Principal 
Priority of Payments in the following order of priority:  
 
firstly, to the Residual Principal Deficiency Ledger as a debit entry up to the 
(a)
aggregate of the sum of (i) the outstanding amount under the Seller Interest Credit 
Facility and (ii) the Principal Amount Outstanding of the Class C Notes on the 
immediately preceding Monthly Payment Date; 
 
secondly, to the Class B Principal Deficiency Ledger up to the Principal Amount 
(b)
Outstanding of the Class B Notes of all Note Series on the immediately preceding 
Monthly Payment Date; and 
 
thirdly, to the Class A Principal Deficiency Ledger up to the Principal Amount 
(c)
Outstanding of the Class A Notes of all Note Series on the immediately preceding 
Monthly Payment Date; 
During the Programme Revolving Period and the Programme Amortisation Period, and with 
respect to any Collection Period, the Management Company shall record as credit entries any 
PDL Cure Amounts in the principal deficiency sub-ledgers in the following order of priority:  
 
firstly, to the Class A Principal Deficiency Ledger until the debit balance thereof is 
(a)
reduced to zero (0); 
 
secondly, to the Class B Principal Deficiency Ledger until the debit balance thereof is 
(b)
reduced to zero (0); and 


 
 
232 
 
 
thirdly, to the Residual Principal Deficiency Ledger until the debit balance thereof is 
(c)
reduced to zero (0). 
The Management Company shall give the relevant instructions to the Issuer Accounts Bank 
on any Monthly Payment Date during the Programme Revolving Period and the Programme 
Amortisation Period in order to, subject to the Interest Priority of Payments, ensure that the 
Principal Account is credited with an amount equal to the debit balance of the Principal 
Deficiency Ledger as of the previous Calculation Date (taking into account the debit of the 
above amounts) by debiting the Interest Account. Such amount then credited to the Principal 
Account shall be credited to the Principal Deficiency Ledger on the same date. 
For these purposes: 
Class A PDL Cure Amount means any amounts retained at item (5) of the Interest Priority 
of Payments to cure any debit balance in respect of the Class A Principal Deficiency Ledger.  
Class B PDL Cure Amount means any amounts retained at item (9) of the Interest Priority 
of Payments to cure any debit balance in respect of the Class B Principal Deficiency Ledger.  
Default Amount means, on any Calculation Date and with respect to the Client Account 
which has become a Defaulted Client Account during the immediately preceding Collection 
Period, the Outstanding Principal Balances of the Purchased Receivables of such Client 
Account on the Cut-Off Date preceding such Calculation Date.  
PDL Cure Amounts means the sum of (i) the Class A PDL Cure Amount, (ii) the Class B 
PDL Cure Amount and (iii) the Residual PDL Cure Amount.  
Residual PDL Cure Amount means any amounts retained at item (12) of the Interest 
Priority of Payment. 
3.4.2.2. 
General Reserve Ledger  
During the Programme Revolving Period and the Programme Amortisation Period, a general 
reserve ledger (the General Reserve Ledger) comprising two sub-ledgers defined as the 
Class A General Reserve Ledger and the Class B General Reserve Ledger, respectively, 
shall be established by the Management Company on the Fund Incorporation Date, in order to 
record on any Calculation Date the amount up to which the General Reserve Account may be 
drawn on the following Monthly Payment Date to make up for any shortfall to satisfy the 
payment of certain items of the Interest Priority of Payments. 
3.4.3. Information on any credit enhancements 
In order to strengthen the financial structure of the Fund, to increase the security or the 
regularity of the payment of the Notes, or generally to transform the financial characteristics 
of the Notes and to complement the management of the Fund, the Management Company on 


 
 
233 
 
behalf of the Fund, will enter into the transactions described below in the Base Prospectus and 
in the Deed of Incorporation, in accordance with applicable legal provisions. 
3.4.3.1. 
Fund Excess Margin 
Irrespective of any credit enhancement mechanisms described in this section and, if 
applicable, any Hedging Agreements specified in any Issuing Document, the main protection 
of the Note Series Noteholders derives, at any date, from the existence of an excess margin.  
The excess margin is equal to the difference between (i) the interest and recoveries received 
under the Purchased Receivables (less the Issuer Operating Expenses and, as the case may be, 
the Hedging Net Amounts due to any Eligible Hedging Counterparties) and (ii) the interest 
amounts payable under the Notes of any Note Series (less, as the case may be, the Hedging 
Net Amounts due by any Eligible Hedging Counterparties). 
3.4.3.2. 
Credit Enhancement of the Notes of any Note Series 
In addition to the Fund’s excess margin and the protection offered by the General Reserve:

B Notes and the Class C Notes of all Notes Series during the Programme Accelerated 
Amortisation Period; 
 
credit enhancement for the Class B Notes of each Notes Series will be provided by 
(b)
the subordination of payments on the Class C Notes of the corresponding Notes 
Series during the Programme Revolving Period and the Programme Amortisation 
Period, and, by the subordination of payments on the Class C Notes of all Notes

(c)
(i) 
by the full subordination of all payments on the Seller Interest Credit Facility 
during the Programme Amortisation Period and the Programme Accelerated 
Amortisation Period, 
(ii) 
by the overcollateralization in the form of additional aggregate outstanding 
principal balance from the Purchased Receivables transferred to the Fund and 
funded through a Deferred Purchase Price mechanism during the Programme 
Revolving Period, the Programme Amortisation Period and the Programme 
Accelerated Amortisation Period. 


 
 
234 
 
3.4.3.3. 
Subordination of Class B Notes 
Pursuant to the Deed of the Incorporation the rights of the holders of Class B Notes to receive

Furthermore, during the Programme Revolving Period and the Programme Amortisation 
Period the right of the Seller to receive payments of the Aggregate Deferred Purchase Price 
remaining unpaid on the preceding Monthly Payment Date is subordinated to the payment of 
interest of the Notes of any Note Series and, in certain circumstances, the payment of 
principal of the Notes of any Note Series. 
In addition, during the Programme Accelerated Amortisation Period the rights of the Seller to 
receive payments (i) of the Aggregate Deferred Purchase Price are subject to the full

General Reserve  
 
Introduction 
(a)
On the Fund Incorporation Date, the Seller as General Reserve Subordinated Facility 
Provider shall provide to the Fund a subordinated facility (the General Reserve 
Subordinated Facility) to fund the general reserve (the General Reserve) which 


 
 
236 
 
shall operate as a credit enhancement mechanism for the purpose of supporting the 
Notes.  
The General Reserve will comprise two sub-ledgers: the Class A General Reserve 
Ledger and the Class B General Reserve Ledger. The credit balance of these ledgers 
may be applied towards payment of interest of the Class A Notes and Class B Notes, 
among other possible uses according to the relevant Priority of Payments. 
The main terms and conditions of the General Reserve Subordinated Facility are 
described in section 3.4.4.2 of the Additional Building Block. 
 
Establishment of the General Reserve  
(b)
On the Fund Incorporation Date, the Fund shall request an initial drawdown under the 
General Reserve Subordinated Facility for an amount equal to the General Reserve 
Required Amount as calculated by the Management Company on the first 
Disbursement Date.  
The General Reserve Subordinated Facility Provider shall make the initial drawdown 
available to the Fund on the first Notes Series Issue Date, for same day-value, by 
crediting the amount of the initial drawdown into the General Reserve Account.  
The amount of the General Reserve will be adjusted in the amount required for its 
balance to match the General Reserve Required Amount in each Monthly Payment 
Date in order to take into account any new issuance or redemption of Notes Series.  
 
Purpose and allocation of the General Reserve  
(c)
The General Reserve will be used in accordance with and subject to the relevant 
Priority of Payments by the Management Company, acting for and on behalf of the 
Fund, to satisfy the obligations of the Fund. 
On each Monthly Payment Date during the Programme Revolving Period and the 
Programme Amortisation Period, the General Reserve Account shall be debited in 
accordance with and subject to the Interest Shortfall Priority of Payments.  
On each Monthly Payment Date during the Programme Accelerated Amortisation

Required Amount on the corresponding Monthly Payment Date, the Management 
Company shall calculate the General Reserve Decrease Amount and shall give the 
relevant instructions to the Issuer Accounts Bank to debit on the Monthly Payment

3.4.4. Details of any subordinated debt financing 
The Subordinated Facilities Providers will grant the Fund the Subordinated Facilities, the 
main terms and conditions whereof are described below.  
For these purposes, Subordinated Facilities Providers means (i) the Commingling Reserve 
Subordinated Facility Provider, (ii) the Expenses Subordinated Facility Provider, (iii) the 
General Reserve Subordinated Facility Provider and (iv) the Seller Interest Credit Facility 
Provider. 
3.4.4.1. 
Expenses Subordinated Facility 
The Expenses Subordinated Facility Provider will grant a subordinated facility (the Expenses 
Subordinated Facility) to the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Expenses 
Subordinated Facility Agreement (the Expenses Subordinated Facility Agreement) that the 
Management Company will use to fund the Initial Expenses and the Note Series Issue 
Expenses (the Fund Non-Operative Expenses). 


 
 
254 
 
The Expenses Subordinated Facility is of a subordinated nature, such that the interest and 
principal amounts owed to the Expenses Subordinated Facility Provider will be subject, as the 
case may be, to the applicable Priority of Payments set out in section 3.4.7.2 of this 
Additional Building Block. 
The aggregate maximum amount of the Expenses Subordinated Facility is up to EUR 
750,000, corresponding to the Initial Expenses and the Note Series Issue Expenses in 
connection with the first Notes Series issued by the Fund (the Maximum Expenses 
Subordinated Facility Amount). 
Notwithstanding the above, further to any drawdown request, the Expenses Subordinated 
Facility Provider undertakes to, and the Management Company, acting in the name and on 
behalf of the Fund, agrees to, increase the Maximum Expenses Subordinated Facility Amount 
to make available any amounts required to fund the Note Series Issue Expenses in connection 
with the issue of further Note Series by the Fund during the Programme Revolving Period, 
being specified that: 
 
the issue of further Note Series by the Fund during the Programme Revolving Period 
(a)
and the amount of the related Note Series Issue Expenses shall be subject to prior 
approval by the Seller; 
 
such increase shall be made without the need to obtain the prior consent from the 
(b)
Noteholders or other funders of the Fund; and 
 
the failure to fund an amount equal to the Note Series Issue Expenses on or prior the 
(c)
relevant Issue Date of such Note Series is an early termination event of the issue of a 
Note Series pursuant to section 4.4.7.1 of the Registration Document.  
The amount of the Expenses Subordinated Facility will be drawn through as many 
drawdowns as may be required during the Availability Period. The Availability Period shall 
commence on the Fund Incorporation Date and shall end on the last day of the Programme 
Revolving Period (for these purposes, the Availability Period).  
On the Fund Incorporation Date, the Management Company shall request an initial drawdown 
under the Expenses Subordinated Facility to fund the Initial Expenses and the Note Series 
Issue Expenses of the first Notes Series. The Expenses Subordinated Facility Provider shall 
make such initial drawdown available to the Fund on the first Note Series Disbursement Date, 
for same day-value, by crediting its amount into the General Account.  
Additionally, and during the Availability Period (to the extent that a new Note Series will be 
issued by the Fund on the following Issue Dates), the Management Company shall request an 
additional drawdown under the Expenses Subordinated Facility in an amount equal to the 
Notes Series Issue Expenses in connection with the forthcoming Note Series as calculated by 
the Management Company and agreed by the Seller. The drawdown request shall need to be 
delivered on or prior to the Calculation date before the Issue Date of the new Notes Series. 


 
 
255 
 
The drawdown amount will be credited in the General Account no later than the relevant 
Issue Date. 
The Fund shall repay the amounts made available to it under the Expenses Subordinated 
Facility on each Monthly Payment Date by an amount equal to the Available Distribution 
Amount after deducting the amounts ranking ahead of it in the relevant Priority of Payments 
(the Expenses Facility Principal Amount). Moreover, the Fund shall repay principal under 
the Expenses Subordinated Facility on the first Monthly Payment Date following the date of 
each drawdown in an amount (if any) equal to the excess of the amount of the relevant 
drawdown over the amount of the relevant Fund Non-Operative Expenses actually incurred or 
committed by the Fund in relation to the relevant Note Series. Such payment shall be made to 
the Expenses Subordinated Facility Provider directly, without application of any Priority of 
Payments.  
Principal amounts repaid will be available for subsequent drawdowns up to the Maximum 
Expenses Subordinated Facility Amount in connection with the issue of further Notes Series 
exclusively. 
Any Expenses Facility Principal Amounts due under the Expenses Subordinated Facility 
which have not been paid to the Expenses Subordinated Facility Provider due to shortage of 
Available Distribution Amounts will be paid on the following Monthly Payment Date on 
which the Available Distribution Amounts permit said payment according to the applicable 
Priority of Payments. Such deferred Expenses Facility Principal Amounts will be paid at the 
same rank but in preference to the Expenses Facility Principal Amounts payable in relation to 
the Expenses Subordinated Facility on said Monthly Payment Date. The Expenses Facility 
Principal Amounts owed to the Expenses Subordinated Facility Provider that remains unpaid 
according to the provisions of the prior paragraphs will not accrue default interest in favour of 
the Expenses Subordinated Facility Provider. 
The amounts outstanding under the Expenses Subordinated Facility shall accrue interest. Such 
interest will be calculated on the basis of an annual interest rate, which will be EONIA + 
0,02% (provided that the interest rate cannot be lower than 0%.) (the Expenses Facility 
Interest Amount).  
For these purposes, EONIA means , in respect of each Interest Accrual Period (as defined 
below), the rate equal to the overnight rate as calculated by the ECB and appearing on the 
Relevant Screen Page two (2) TARGET2 Business Days before the date on which such 
Interest Accrual Period begins. 
The term of the Expenses Subordinated Facility shall be divided into consecutive interest 
accrual periods (each of them, an Interest Accrual Period) comprising the days effectively 
elapsed between each Monthly Payment Date, including in each Interest Accrual Period the 
initial Monthly Payment Date and excluding the final Monthly Payment Date. The first 
Interest Accrual Period shall commence on the Fund Incorporation Date and end on the 
immediately following Monthly Payment Date.  


 
 
256 
 
The Expenses Facility Interest Amount will be settled on each Monthly Payment Date, and 
will be calculated on the following basis: (i) the actual effective days in each Interest Accrual 
Period and (ii) a 360 day year. The Expenses Facility Interest Amount will be paid on each 
Monthly Payment Date in accordance with and subject to the Priority of Payments. 
Any Expenses Facility Interest Amount due under the Expenses Subordinated Facility which 
have not been paid to the Expenses Subordinated Facility Provider due to shortage of 
Available Distribution Amounts will be paid on the following Monthly Payment Date on 
which the Available Distribution Amounts permit said payment according to the applicable 
Priority of Payments. Such deferred Expenses Facility Interest Amount will be paid at the 
same rank but in preference to the Expenses Facility Interest Amount payable in relation to 
the Expenses Subordinated Facility on said Monthly Payment Date. The Expenses Facility 
Interest Amount owed to the Expenses Subordinated Facility Provider that remains unpaid 
according to the provisions of the prior paragraphs will not accrue default interest in favour of 
the Expenses Subordinated Facility Provider. 
The Expenses Subordinated Facility shall be repaid by the Fund in full on the Fund 
Liquidation Date and subject to the full payment of any amounts ranking in higher priority 
pursuant to applicable Priority of Payments. Any amount under the Expenses Subordinated 
Facility not paid on the Fund Liquidation Date shall be cancelled and deemed as a final loss 
for the Expenses Subordinated Facility Provider. 
The Expenses Subordinated Facility Agreement shall end on the earlier of: 
 
the Fund Liquidation Date; or 
(a)
 
as the case may be, the Monthly Payment Date on which all the amounts due (either 
(b)
as principal or interest) under the Expenses Subordinated Facility are satisfied and no 
further drawdowns are permitted thereunder. 
3.4.4.2. 
General Reserve Subordinated Facility  
The General Reserve Subordinated Facility Provider will grant a General Reserve 
Subordinated Facility to the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the General Reserve 
Subordinated Facility Agreement (the General Reserve Subordinated Facility Agreement) 
that the Management Company will use to fund the General Reserve. 
The General Reserve Subordinated Facility is of a subordinated nature, such that the interest 
amounts owed to the General Reserve Subordinated Facility Provider may be subject to the 
relevant Priority of Payments set out in section 3.4.7.2 of this Additional Building Block. 
The maximum amount of the General Reserve Subordinated Facility is up to EUR 5,640,000, 
corresponding to the General Reserve Required Amount as of the first Notes Issue 
Disbursement Date as calculated by the Management Company (the Maximum General 
Reserve Subordinated Facility Amount).  


 
 
257 
 
Notwithstanding the above, further to any drawdown request, the General Reserve 
Subordinated Facility Provider undertakes to, and the Management Company, acting in the 
name and on behalf of the Fund, agrees to, increase the Maximum General Reserve 
Subordinated Facility Amount to the extent required in order to make available any amounts 
required to fund any General Reserve Increase Amount in the context of the issue of further 
Note Series approved by the Seller during the Programme Revolving Period, being specified 
that: 
 
such increase shall be made without the need to obtain the prior consent from the 
(a)
Noteholders or any other funders of the Fund; and 
 
the failure to fund the General Reserve up to the General Reserve Required Amount 
(b)
on the Issue Date of the relevant Note Series is an early termination event of the issue 
of a Note Series pursuant to section 4.4.7.1 of the Registration Document.  
In addition, the General Reserve Subordinated Facility Provider and the Management 
Company, acting in the name and on behalf of the Fund, may agree to voluntarily increase the 
Maximum General Reserve Subordinated Facility Amount from time to time in order to make 
available additional drawdowns under the General Reserve Subordinated Facility to avoid any 
downgrade or withdrawal of the rating of the then outstanding Rated Notes by any Relevant 
Rating Agency. 
The General Reserve Subordinated Facility Provider and the Management Company, acting 
in the name and on behalf of the Fund, may agree to decrease the maximum General Reserve 
Subordinated Facility Amount from time to time during the Programme Revolving Period 
without the need to obtain the prior consent from the Noteholders or any other funders of the 
Fund, subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions: 
 
such decrease shall not cause a repayment or a prepayment of any drawdown 
(a)
previously made under the General Reserve Subordinated Facility; 
 
prior notice is given by the Management Company to each Relevant Rating Agencies 
(b)
no later than thirty (30) calendar days prior to the effective date of such decrease;  
 
any decrease will not result in the downgrade or withdrawal of the then current rating 
(c)
of any of the then outstanding Rated Notes by any of the Relevant Rating Agencies; 
and 
 
the decrease will not cause the occurrence of a Revolving Termination Event or an 
(d)
Accelerated Amortisation Event. 
The amount of the General Reserve Subordinated Facility will be drawn through as many 
drawdowns as may be required during the Availability Period in connection with the issue of 
further Note Series only. The Availability Period shall commence on the Fund Incorporation 
Date and shall end on the last day of the Programme Revolving Period (for these purposes, 
the Availability Period).  


 
 
258 
 
On the Fund Incorporation Date, the Management Company shall request an initial drawdown 
under the General Reserve Subordinated Facility for an amount of EUR 5,640,000. The 
amount of the initial drawdown will be equal to the General Reserve Required Amount as of 
the first Notes Issue Disbursement Date, as calculated by the Management Company. The 
General Reserve Subordinated Facility Provider shall make the initial drawdown available to 
the Fund on the first Notes Issue Disbursement Date, for same day-value, by crediting the 
amount of the initial drawdown into the General Reserve Account.  
Additionally, and during the Availability Period, if the Management Company determines on 
any Calculation Date that the balance of the General Reserve Account will be below the 
General Reserve Required Amount on the next Issue Date on which a Note Series is issued by 
the Fund, the Management Company shall request an additional drawdown under the General 
Reserve Subordinated Facility in respect of the amount of the General Reserve Increase 
Amount. The drawdown request shall need to be delivered on or prior to the Calculation Date 
preceding such Issue Date. The General Reserve Increase Amount will be credited in the 
General Reserve Account. 
The Fund shall repay the amounts made available to it under the General Reserve 
Subordinated Facility on each Monthly Payment Date during the Programme Revolving 
Period or the Programme Amortisation Period by an amount equal to the applicable General 
Reserve Decrease Amount (as determined by the Management Company on the relevant 
Calculation Date) on the relevant Monthly Payment Date, such repayment being not subject 
to the applicable Priority of Payments.  
For the avoidance of doubt, no General Reserve Decrease Amount shall be repaid during the 
Programme Accelerated Amortisation Period.  
Any General Reserve Shortfall Amount due under the General Reserve Subordinated Facility 
will be paid on each Monthly Payment Date in accordance with the relevant Priority of 
Payments. The General Reserve Shortfall Amount will not accrue interest or default interest 
in favor of the General Reserve Subordinated Facility Provider.  
Principal under the General Reserve Subordinated Facility shall be repaid by the Fund on the 
Fund Liquidation Date in an amount equal to the part of the General Reserve Amount. Any 
principal amount under the General Reserve Subordinated Facility not paid on the Fund 
Liquidation Date pursuant to the preceding paragraphs shall be cancelled and deemed as a 
final loss for the General Reserve Subordinated Facility Provider. 
Principal amounts repaid will be available for subsequent drawdown up to the Maximum 
General Reserve Subordinated Facility Available Amount in connection with the issue of 
further Note Series or to avoid any downgrade or withdrawal of the rating of the then 
outstanding Rated Notes by any Relevant Rating Agency. 
The amounts outstanding under the General Reserve Subordinated Facility shall accrue 
interest. Such interest will be calculated on the basis of an annual interest rate, which will be 


 
 
259 
 
EONIA + 0,02% (provided that the interest rate cannot be lower than 0%.) (the General 
Reserve Interest Amount).  
The term of the General Reserve Subordinated Facility shall be divided into consecutive 
interest accrual periods (each of them, an Interest Accrual Period) comprising the days 
effectively elapsed between each Monthly Payment Date, including in each Interest Accrual 
Period the initial Monthly Payment Date and excluding the final Monthly Payment Date. The 
first Interest Accrual Period shall commence on the Fund Incorporation Date and end on the 
immediately following Monthly Payment Date.  
The General Reserve Interest Amount will be settled on each Monthly Payment Date, and will 
be calculated on the following basis: (i) the actual effective days in each Interest Accrual 
Period and (ii) a 360 day year. The General Reserve Interest Amount will be paid on each 
Monthly Payment Date in accordance with the relevant Priority of Payments. 
Any General Reserve Interest Amounts due under the General Reserve Subordinated Facility 
which have not been paid to the General Reserve Subordinated Facility Provider due to 
shortage of Available Distribution Amounts will be paid on the following Monthly Payment 
Date on which the Available Distribution Amounts permit said payment according to the 
applicable Priority of Payments. Such deferred amounts will be paid on the same rank but in 
preference to the General Reserve Interest Amounts payable in relation to the General 
Reserve Subordinated Facility on said Monthly Payment Date. The General Reserve Interest 
Amounts owed to the General Reserve Subordinated Facility Provider that remains unpaid 
according to the provisions of the prior paragraphs will not accrue default interest in favour of 
the General Reserve Subordinated Facility Provider. 
Any General Reserve Interest Amount under the General Reserve Subordinated Facility not 
paid on the Fund Liquidation Date shall be cancelled and deemed as a final loss for the 
General Reserve Subordinated Facility Provider.  
The General Reserve Subordinated Facility Agreement shall end on the earlier of: 
 
the Fund Liquidation Date; or

as the case may be, the Monthly Payment Date on which all the amounts due (either 
(b)
as principal or interest) under the General Reserve Subordinated Facility are satisfied 
and no further drawdowns are permitted thereunder.

Building Block. 
The total amount of the Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility will be EUR 
€30,000,000.00 (the Maximum Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility Amount).  
Notwithstanding the above, further to any drawdown request, the Commingling Reserve 
Subordinated Facility Provider undertakes to, and the Management Company, acting in the 
name and on behalf of the Fund agrees to, increase the Maximum Commingling Reserve 
Subordinated Facility Amount to the extent required in order to make available any amounts 
required to fund any Commingling Reserve Increase Amount during the Availability Period, 
being specified that: 
 
no prior consent from the Noteholders or any other funders of the Fund will be 
(a)
required; and 
 
the failure to fund the Commingling Reserve up to the Commingling Reserve 
(b)
Required Amount on the Issue Date of the relevant Note Series is an early 
termination event of the issue of a Note Series pursuant to section 4.4.7.1 of the 
Registration Document.  
In addition, the Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility Provider and the Management 
Company, acting in the name and on behalf of the Fund, may agree to decrease the Maximum 
Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility Amount from time to time without the need to 
obtain the prior consent from the Noteholders or any other funders of the Fund, subject to the 
satisfaction of the following conditions:

any decrease will not result in the downgrade or withdrawal of the then current rating 
(c)
of any of the then outstanding Rated Notes by any of the Relevant Rating Agencies; 
and 
 
the decrease will not cause the occurrence of a Revolving Termination Event or an 
(d)
Accelerated Amortisation Event. 
The amount of the Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility will be drawn through as 
many drawdowns as may be required during the Availability Period. The Availability Period 
shall commence on the Fund Incorporation Date and shall end on the Fund Liquidation Date 
(for these purposes, the Availability Period).  


 
 
261 
 
On the Fund Incorporation Date, the Management Company shall request an initial drawdown 
under the Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility for an amount of EUR 9,100,000. The 
amount of the initial drawdown will be equal to the Commingling Reserve Required Amount, 
as of the first Notes Issue Disbursement Date as calculated by the Management Company. 
The Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility Provider shall make the initial drawdown 
available to the Fund on the first Notes Issue Disbursement Date for same day-value, by 
crediting the amount of the initial drawdown into the Commingling Reserve Account 
Additionally, and during the Availability Period, if the Management Company determines on 
any Calculation Date on the basis of the information provided to it by the Servicer that the 
balance of the Commingling Reserve Account will be below the applicable Commingling 
Reserve Required Amount on the relevant Settlement Date or Issue Date when a new Note 
Series is issued, as the case may be, the Management Company shall request on such 
Calculation Date an additional drawdown under the Commingling Reserve Subordinated 
Facility in an amount equal to Commingling Reserve Increase Amount to be credited in the 
Commingling Reserve Account on the next Settlement Date (and/or, if applicable, on the 
Issue Date when a new Note Series is issued).  
If the Management Company determines on a Calculation Date that the estimated balance of 
the Commingling Reserve Account will be exceeding the applicable Commingling Reserve 
Required Amount on the next Monthly Payment Date, the Management Company shall 
calculate: 
 
the Commingling Reserve Decrease Amount and shall give the relevant instructions 
(a)
to the Issuer Accounts Bank to debit the Commingling Reserve Account in such 
amount which will be used to repay any principal outstanding under the 
Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility on such Monthly Payment Date, such 
repayment not being subject to the relevant Priority of Payments; and 
 
the Commingling Reserve Shortfall Amount and shall give the relevant instructions to 
(b)
the Issuer Accounts Bank to debit the Interest Account (or, during the Programme 
Accelerated Amortisation Period, the General Account) in such amount which will be 
used to repay any principal outstanding under the Commingling Reserve 
Subordinated Facility on such Monthly Payment Date, subject to the relevant Priority 
of Payments. 
Notwithstanding the above, if the Management Company does not receive any Monthly 
Servicer Report, it shall be entitled to retain any amount that should be used to repay the 
Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility in the Commingling Reserve Account until the 
date on which Management Company shall receive from the Servicer (or any replacement 
servicer) the Monthly Servicer Report or other documentary evidence which demonstrates to 
the satisfaction of the Management Company that there are no remaining amounts which 
should be transferred by the Servicer to the Fund in respect of all Available Collections it 
received during all Collection Periods for which no Monthly Servicer Report had been 
prepared by the Servicer and/or sent to the Fund by the Servicer. 


 
 
262 
 
If the Management Company has ultimately received the Monthly Servicer Report(s) and/or 
the abovementioned satisfactory documentary evidence, the Management Company shall 
make the necessary reconciliations and determine the amount to be, as the case may be: 
 
debited from the Commingling Reserve Account and credited to the Principal 
(a)
Account and the Interest Account (as applicable) for the purpose to be applied as 
Available Collections; or  
 
(x) in respect of the Commingling Reserve Decrease Amount, debited from the 
(b)
Commingling Reserve Account and repaid directly to the Seller (being specified that 
such repayment not being subject to the relevant Priority of Payments) or (y) in 
respect of the Commingling Reserve Shortfall Amount, debited from the Interest 
Account or, during the Programme Accelerated Amortisation Period, the General 
Account, unless (and only for so long as the Servicer is the Seller): 
(i) 
a Servicer Termination Event has occurred and is continuing and no 
replacement servicer has been appointed by the Management Company in 
accordance with section 3.7.2.15 of the Additional Building Block; or  
(ii) 
the Borrowers have not been notified of the transfer of the Purchased 
Receivables in accordance with section 3.7.2.15 of the Additional Building 
Block, 
provided that, in any case, the Management Company shall retain from that 
repayment any amount due by the Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility 
Provider on such day to maintain the Commingling Reserve at an amount equal to the 
Commingling Reserve Required Amount applicable on such day.  
 
debited from the General Account and credited to the Commingling Reserve Account 
(c)
in order to compensate any amount the Fund previously failed to receive and for 
which an use of the Commingling Reserve had been made by debit from the 
Commingling Reserve Account. 
The Fund may re-borrow any part of the Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility which 
is repaid up to the Maximum Commingling Reserve Facility Available Amount.  
Principal under the Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility shall be repaid by the Fund 
on the Fund Liquidation Date subject to the repayment in full of the Notes of any Notes 
Series. Any amount under the Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility not paid pursuant 
to the preceding paragraphs shall be cancelled and deemed as a final loss for the 
Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility Provider. 
The amounts outstanding under the Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility shall accrue 
interest. Such interest will be calculated on the basis of an annual interest rate, which will be

Company will use to:  
 
with regards to the purchase of the initial portfolio of Eligible Receivables on the 
(a)
Fund Incorporation Date: 
(i) 
to finance in part (together with any Notes Series issued on the Fund 
Incorporation Date) the purchase of the initial portfolio of Eligible 
Receivables (in the context of the first Initial Transfer) from the Seller; or 


 
 
264 
 
(ii) 
if the Note Series to be issued on the Fund Incorporation Date are early

(b)
Programme Revolving Period:  
(i) 
to finance in full or in part the purchase of Receivables (either in the context 
in Initial Transfers or Additional Transfers) from the Seller on any Purchase 
Date; and/or  
(ii) 
to redeem existing Note Series. 
On each Calculation Date, the Management Company will determine the SICF Drawing 
Amount and the amount to be, as the case may be, drawn under the Seller Interest Credit 
Facility or repaid to the Seller Interest Credit Facility Provider. 
The Seller Interest Credit Facility is of a subordinated nature during the Programme 
Amortisation Period and the Programme Accelerated Amortisation Period, such that the 
principal and interest amounts owed to the Seller Interest Credit Facility Provider will be 
subject to the relevant Priority of Payments set out in section 3.4.7.2 of this Additional 
Building Block. 
The total amount of the Seller Interest Credit Facility will be EUR two billion 
(€2,000,000,000) (the Maximum Seller Interest Credit Facility Amount).  
Notwithstanding the above, further to any drawdown request, the Seller Interest Credit 
Facility Provider undertakes to, and the Management Company, acting in the name and on 
behalf of the Fund, agrees to, increase the Maximum Seller Interest Credit Facility Amount to

Credit Facility to fund any SICF Drawing Amount during the Programme Revolving Period, 
being specified that: 
 
such increase shall be made without the need to obtain the prior consent from the 
(a)
Noteholders or any other funders of the Fund; and 
 
a failure by the Seller Interest Credit Facility Provider to make available the Seller 
(b)
Interest Credit Facility for an amount equal to the SICF Drawing Amount on any 
Settlement Date after the Fund Incorporation Date shall constitute a Revolving 
Termination Event. 
In addition, the Seller Interest Credit Facility Provider and the Management Company, acting 
in the name and on behalf of the Fund may decrease the Maximum Seller Interest Credit 
Facility Amount from time to time without the need to obtain the prior consent from the 


 
 
265 
 
Noteholders or any other funders of the Fund, subject to the satisfaction of the following 
conditions: 
 
such decrease shall not cause a repayment or a prepayment of any drawdown 
(a)
previously made under the Seller Interest Credit Facility; 
 
the Maximum Seller Interest Credit Facility Amount will be at least equal to EUR 
(b)
1,000,000,000; 
 
prior notice is given by the Management Company to each Relevant Rating Agencies 
(c)
no later than thirty (30) calendar days prior to the effective date of such decrease;  
 
any decrease will not result in the downgrade or withdrawal of the then current rating 
(d)
of any of the then outstanding Rated Notes by any of the Relevant Rating Agencies; 
and 
 
the decrease will not cause the occurrence of a Revolving Termination Event or an 
(e)
Accelerated Amortisation Event. 
The amount of the Seller Interest Facility will be drawn through as many drawdowns as may 
be required during the Availability Period. The Availability Period shall commence on the 
Fund Incorporation Date and shall end on the last day of the Programme Revolving Period 
(the Availability Period). 
The Fund may request a drawdown under the Seller Interest Credit Facility on the

Each Drawdown request (other than the one to be made on the Disbursement Date of the first 
Note Series issued by the Fund) shall need to be delivered no later than on the Calculation 
Date preceding the relevant Settlement Date 
The Seller Interest Credit Facility Provider shall make the drawdowns available to the Fund

purchase of Receivables or (ii) on each Settlement Date, for same day-value by crediting the 
amount of the Drawdowns into the Principal Account if the drawdown is used to redeem 
existing Note Series.

Calculation Date immediately preceding such Monthly Payment Date.

Monthly Payment Date. The SICF Interest Amounts owed to the Seller Interest Credit Facility 
Provider that remain unpaid according to the provisions of the prior paragraphs will not 
accrue default interest in favour of the Seller Interest Credit Facility Provider. Any SICF 
Interest Amounts under the Seller Interest Credit Facility not paid on the Fund Liquidation 
Date shall be cancelled and deemed as a final loss for the Seller Interest Credit Facility 
Provider. 
The Seller Interest Credit Facility Agreement shall end on the earlier of 
 
the Fund Liquidation Date; or

If on any relevant Monthly Payment Date, the Available Distribution Amount is not sufficient

and to the lender under the Subordinated Facilities are dependent 
3.4.8.1. 
Hedging Agreements  
General  
The Receivables to be purchased by the Fund bear an adjustable fixed interest rate while the 
Class A Notes and/or the Class B Notes and/or the Class C Notes of any Note Series may bear 
a floating rate of interest as specified in the relevant the Issuing Document. 
Consequently, the Fund may be exposed to interest rate risk which may be hedged through 
the setting of a Maximum Interest Rate to the relevant Notes or with any Class A Hedging 
Agreement on the issue of any Class A Floating Rate Notes, any Class B Hedging Agreement 
on the issue of any Class B Floating Rate Notes and any Class C Hedging Agreement on the 
issue of any Class C Floating Rate Notes entered into between the Fund, represented by the 
Management Company, and any Eligible Hedging Counterparties. 
If the interest rate exposure of the Fund in relation to any Class of Notes of any Note Series is 
to be hedged by the entering into a Hedging Agreement in respect of the relevant Class of 
Notes of a Note Series (the Hedged Notes), the Management Company, on behalf of the 
Fund, will enter into one or more Hedging Agreements with Eligible Hedging Counterparties, 
as specified in the relevant Issuing Document in respect of the Hedged Notes. It is expected 
that the Hedging Agreements will be interest rate swaps, but other financial derivatives 
agreements (eg. interest rate collar, interest rate cap) may be entering into for hedging 
purposes by the Management Company, on behalf of the Fund, depending on the conditions 
of the financial markets at the time the Hedged Notes are issued. 


 
 
306 
 
The Hedging Agreements will each be documented by means of (i) a master netting 
agreement in the form of the 2002 ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border), as 
published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc., (an ISDA Master 
Agreement) the schedule and the credit support annex thereto (an ISDA Credit Support 
Annex), together with the confirmation setting out the terms of each hedging transaction, (ii) 
a Contrato Marco de Operaciones Financieras (a CMOF Master Agreement) in its 2013 
version (or any other version as selected by the Management Company), as prepared by the 
Spanish Bankers Association (Asociación Española de Banca) and the Spanish Savings 
Banks Association (Confederación Española de Cajas de Ahorros), together with its Annex I, 
the credit support annex thereto (Anexo III – Acuerdo de Realización de Cesiones en 
Garantía) (the CMOF Credit Support Annex, and together with the ISDA Credit Support 
Annex, the Credit Support Annex) and the confirmation setting out the terms of each 
Hedging Agreement, or (iii) any other financial transactions master netting documentation 
which the Management Company deems suitable for the relevant Hedging Agreement. 
The Management Company may, on behalf of the Fund, (i) enter into master netting 
agreements (together with the applicable Credit Support Annexes or any other equivalent 
credit support agreements) to hedge one or more Notes Series, in which case a master netting 
agreement may cover more than one hedging transaction and therefore hedge various series of 
Hedged Notes; (ii) enter into specific individual master netting agreements in respect of each 
series of Hedged Notes, in which case the Fund may enter into multiple Hedging Agreements 
in order to hedge individual (or specific groups of) series of Hedged Notes, or (iii) enter into a 
combination of the foregoing, as decided by the Management Company, on behalf of the 
Fund, on a case by case basis.  
Payments under the Hedging Agreements 
If the relevant hedging transactions entered into under the Hedging Agreements are interest 
rate swap transactions (IRSs), the basic structure of the hedging transactions to be entered 
into by the Fund is expected to be as follows: 
 
The Eligible Hedging Counterparties will pay to the Fund on the payment dates 
(a)
specified in the relevant transaction confirmations, an amount calculated by reference 
to the Reference Rate payable on the Hedged Notes. 
 
The Eligible Hedging Counterparties will receive from the Fund on, on the payment 
(b)
dates specified in the relevant transactions confirmations, , an amount calculated with 
reference to a fixed rate.  
 
Netting between the foregoing fixed and floating payments will apply, in accordance 
(c)
with the terms specified below and pursuant to the Hedging Agreements. 
 
The applicable notional amount for the relevant IRSs will be the aggregate Principal 
(d)
Amount Outstanding of the Hedged Notes on each Payment Date or, otherwise, as set 
out in the relevant transaction confirmations.  


 
 
307 
 
 
The Calculation Agent (as defined in the Hedging Agreement) under the Hedging 
(e)
Agreements shall be set out in the relevant Hedging Agreements. 
 
The fixed rate payable by the Fund under each IRS shall be as agreed between the 
(f)
Management Company, on behalf of the Fund, and the applicable Eligible Hedging 
Counterparties and shall be set out in the relevant transaction confirmation. 
 
Where any Hedging Net Amount is due to be paid by the relevant Eligible Hedging 
(g)
Counterparty, the Eligible Hedging Counterparty will make the relevant payment to 
the Fund on the payment date set out in the relevant transaction confirmation.  
 
Where the Hedging Net Amount is due to be paid by the Fund, the Fund will make 
(h)
the relevant payment to the relevant Eligible Hedging Counterparty on the payment 
date set out in the relevant transaction confirmation but subject to and in accordance 
with the Interest Priority of Payments. 
Early Termination 
The occurrence of certain termination events and events of default shall be set out in each 
Hedging Agreement which may cause the termination of such Hedging Agreement prior to its 
stated termination date, and which may include, among others, the following Additional 
Termination Events (as such term shall be defined in the relevant Hedging Agreements): 
 
Amendments to the provisions of Section 17 of the Deed of Incorporation of the Fund 
(a)
(and as described in Section 3.4.7 of the Additional Building Block) without the prior 
written consent of the Eligible Hedging Counterparty, such that the Funds’ 
obligations to the Eligible Hedging Counterparty under the Hedging Agreement are 
further contractually subordinated to Fund’s obligations to any other party.  
 
If any of the Programme Documents is amended without the Hedging Counterparty's 
(b)
prior written consent, where the Eligible Hedging Counterparty reasonably 
determines that such amendment would have a material adverse effect on its interests 
as a result of materially adversely affecting the timing, amount, enforceability or 
priority in respect of any payment, delivery or any other contractual rights of the 
Eligible Hedging Counterparty under the Hedging Agreement or any other relevant 
Programme Document. 
 
The occurrence in respect of the Fund of an Accelerated Amortisation Event.  
(c)
 
The notice by the Management Company that it will proceed to liquidate or 
(d)
extinguish the Fund pursuant to the provisions set out in Section 4.4.3 of the 
Registration Document. 
In addition, a Hedging Agreement may be terminated by either of the Management Company, 
on behalf of the Fund, or the relevant Eligible Hedging Counterparty in circumstances 
affecting the other party which may include circumstances where: 


 
 
308 
 
 
the other party is in default by reason of failure to make payments; 
(a)
 
the other party breaches certain other obligations under the Hedging Agreement 
(b)
(other than payment obligations); or 
 
the other party is insolvent or falls under any of the events classified as bankruptcy or 
(c)
insolvency events under the relevant Hedging Agreement, subject to certain 
exceptions applicable in respect of the Fund. 
Moreover, a Hedging Agreement may also be terminated by either of the Management 
Company, on behalf of the Fund, or the relevant Eligible Hedging Counterparty, in the event 
that: 
 
it becomes unlawful under any applicable law (including without limitation the laws 
(a)
of any country in which payment, delivery or compliance is required by either party) 
for a party to the relevant Hedging Agreement to make or receive payments or 
deliveries or to comply with any other material obligation under the relevant Hedging 
Agreement; 
 
by reason of force majeure or act of state (so long as the force majeure or act of state 
(b)
is beyond the control of such party) occurring after a transaction is entered into, a 
party to the relevant Hedging Agreement is prevented from performing its payment 
obligations, from receiving any payments or deliveries or otherwise performing any 
material obligations under the relevant Hedging Agreement; or 
 
a party to the relevant Hedging Agreement is obliged to gross up payments following 
(c)
any withholding or deduction for or on account of any taxes or it receives a payment 
in respect of which an amount is required to be deducted or withheld for or on 
account of any taxes. 
Rating Events 
The Hedging Agreements may provide that if a Rating Event (as described in the Hedging 
Agreements and in the relevant Issuing Document) (a Rating Event) occurs in relation to an 
Eligible Hedging Counterparty, the affected Eligible Hedging Counterparty shall carry out, 
within the time frame specified in the relevant Hedging Agreement, one or more remedial 
measures at the cost of the Eligible Hedging Counterparty which will include the following: 
 
transfer or novate all of its rights and obligations under the relevant Hedging 
(a)
Agreement to another suitably rated Eligible Hedging Counterparty; 
 
arrange for another suitably rated entity to become co-obligor or guarantor in respect 
(b)
of the obligations of the Eligible Hedging Counterparty; 
 
post collateral to support its obligations under the Hedging Agreement; and/or 
(c)


 
 
309 
 
 
take such other action as will result in the rating of the Hedged Notes then 
(d)
outstanding following the taking of such action (or following such non-action) being 
rated no lower than the rating of the Hedged Notes immediately prior to the relevant 
downgrade of the relevant Eligible Hedging Counterparty. 
If, following a Rating Event with respect to the relevant Eligible Hedging Counterparty, the 
relevant Eligible Hedging Counterparty fails to take any one of the required measures set out 
in the Hedging Agreement within the relevant time period specified therein then, subject to 
any terms specified under the Hedging Agreement, such failure may constitute a Termination 
Event with the Fund being entitled to terminate the relevant Hedging Agreement if certain 
conditions are met. 
Collateral 
Following the occurrence of a Rating Event in respect of an Eligible Hedging Counterparty, 
as described above, the relevant Eligible Hedging Counterparty may be required to transfer 
additional collateral in accordance with the relevant Credit Support Annex. 
Any collateral in the form of cash will be deposited to the credit of the Hedging Collateral 
Cash Account and any collateral in the form of securities will be deposited to the credit of the 
Hedging Collateral Securities Account which may be opened at such time. The Hedging 
Collateral Cash Account has been opened with the Issuer Accounts Bank.  
The parties to the Programme Documents who receive and hold monies or provide support to 
the transaction pursuant to the terms of such documents (such as the Issuer Accounts Bank) 
are required to satisfy certain criteria to continue to be counterparty to the Fund. These 
criteria include requirements in relation to the short-term and long-term unguaranteed and 
unsecured ratings ascribed to such party by the Relevant Rating Agencies (ie. the Account 
Bank Required Ratings). If the Issuer Accounts Bank ceases to satisfy the applicable criteria, 
then the role of Issuer Accounts Bank will be transferred to another entity which does satisfy 
the applicable Account Bank Required Ratings. 
Amounts standing to the credit of each Hedging Collateral Account will not be available for 
the Fund to make payments to the Noteholders or any other creditor of the Fund, but will be 
applied only as set out in the Hedging Collateral Account Priority of Payments. The Fund's 
obligation to return, from time to time, any collateral standing to the Hedging Collateral 
Accounts to an Eligible Hedging Counterparty will be met, from time to time, by utilising 
monies and/or securities standing to the credit of the Hedging Collateral Accounts, in the 
manner and subject to the provisions of the Hedging Collateral Account Priority of Payments, 
and not in accordance with the Interest Priority of Payments or the Principal Priority of 
Payments or other distribution rules applicable to other creditors of the Fund, without 
prejudice to any early termination amounts due to the Hedging Counterparty.

3.5.1. Historic Performance information for Credit Cards originated by the Seller 
 
General 
(a)
The graphs of this section have been prepared on the basis of the internal records of

Receivables arising from its portfolio of Credit Card Agreements with the following 
criteria:  
(i) 
the Credit Card Agreements are executed in Spain;  
(ii) 
the Borrowers are at least 18 years old at the time of execution of the Credit 
Card Agreements; 


 
 
314 
 
(iii) 
the Borrowers are domiciled in Spain at the time of execution of the Credit

Classic - PASS credit card; 
(B) 
Gold - PASS credit card; 
(C) 
Business - PASS credit card; or

The historical performance data has been extracted starting from January 2012 and 
ending on January 2017 (included). 
In addition, for the purposes of the information contained in this section, only 
interest-bearing instalments (crédito) have been considered.  
Actual performance may be influenced by a variety of economic, social, geographic 
and other factors beyond the control of SFC. It may also be influenced by changes in 
SFC’s Credit and Servicing Policies. 
There can be no assurance that the future experience and performance of the

the 
Purchased 
Receivables 
 
Introduction 
(a)
The Servicer may amend the terms of any of the Purchased Receivables subject to 
and in accordance with this section 3.7.2.12.

(b)
The Seller has undertaken to pay to the Fund all Seller Dilutions with respect to any

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the effect of any such amendment, variation, 
termination or waiver results in a write-off or the forgiveness of whole or part of any 
Outstanding Principal Balance of a Purchased Receivable relating to a Performing 
Client Account, the Servicer cannot agree to any such amendment, variation,

3.7.2.13. 
Servicing Policies 
 
Mitigation of risk via recovery of bad debts 
(a)


 
 
343 
 
The policies and servicing procedures outlined in this section apply to all credit cards 
managed by the Seller (including both securitised and non-securitised credit cards). 
These policies and servicing procedures are reviewed annually and are updated 
accordingly if they need change (subject to the internal prior approvals that are 
required). The Seller carries out specific control and management of all cases of non-
payment. The actual debt recovery actions are outsourced to a number of specialised 
service providers. This notwithstanding, the Seller has an in-house team dedicated to 
recovery-related matters (the Recovery Department) entrusted with the allocation of 
transactions to the various debt recovery third party specialists and with the on-going 
monitoring of their performance. The Seller also decides when it is appropriate to 
start litigation proceedings. The debt recovery process is carried out in three (3) key 
stages explained below; in all cases the Credit Card is automatically blocked (so that 
no further drawdowns are possible) in order to avoid an increase in the Borrower's 
credit risk: 
(1) 
Anticipation. At this stage, action is taken regarding Borrowers who fail to 
pay their first Instalment, attempting to remedy the situation. Actions taken 
are aimed at obtaining a full or partial payment and include the re-
presentation of the Receivables for payment by direct debit, refinancing 
proposals and eventually partial write-offs.  
(2) 
Recovery. At this stage, action is taken regarding Borrowers who have 
missed two (2) or more than two (2) monthly Instalments (which do not need 
to be consecutive). The recovery action taken differs depending on the type 
of Borrower and his/her payment record ("historial de pagos") with the 
Seller, establishing a segmentation of Borrowers which helps optimising 
recovery efforts. Actions taken are aimed at obtaining a full or partial 
payment and include the re-presentation of the Receivables for payment by 
direct debit, refinancing proposals (such as the adjustment of the monthly 
instalment in an amount at least equal to the minimum contractual instalment) 
and eventually partial write-offs of interest and fees (but not of principal).  
(3) 
Contentious. At this stage, action is taken regarding Borrowers who have 
missed six (6) monthly Instalments (which do not need to be consecutive), at 
which point in time (as a general rule) all debt is accelerated and legal action 
(including the possibility of initiating legal proceedings before the courts) is 
taken. 
The Seller's recovery policy takes into account both cost optimisation and the 
outcome of the recovery as well as the risks inherent to the same, particularly from a 
reputational perspective; in this regard, the Seller establishes the safeguards necessary 
to make it possible to mitigate this risk via thorough quality and customer service 
tests.   


 
 
344 
 
During each of the phases of the recovery process, management thereof is assisted by 
a decision-assistance system (so-called "systema experto"). This system for instance 
assists in the allocation of transactions among the different recovery phases outlined 
below or in the automatic delivery of direct debit remittances. 
The debt recovery process followed in each phases is described below, concentrating 
the greatest efforts in the first phases, in which the efficiency of the debt recovery 
actions is greater: 
(1) 
Anticipation: After the first instalment is unpaid, customers are assigned a 
score of first default according to certain variables that determines the type of 
actions to be taken and the company in charge of managing the recovery 
process:  
 
External management with Cetelem. Telephone calls, sending letters 
and negotiation. 
 
External management by other debt collection companies. Telephone 
calls, sending letters and negotiation. The files are assigned to 
external companies based on the score assigned to the client. 
 
Informative management: Only sending letters and automatic text 
messages (SMS). 
In addition to the foregoing, in case a receivable presented for payment by 
direct debit is returned, it is re-sent for payment by direct debit. 
In all cases, upon breach of payment, the credit card is blocked for use in 
order to prevent a subsequent use thereof. The blocking takes place upon the 
first instalment being unpaid. 
(2) 
Recovery: If after the initial efforts made in the Anticipation phase it is not 
possible to find an amicable repayment solution with the client, the case goes 
to the Recovery phase, in which the clients are separated in different 
portfolios that are sent to external companies and Cetelem. The files are 
assigned to external companies based on the score assigned to the client. 
These files are managed by the external companies during three months, 
being the function of the Recovery Department the control and monitoring of 
the management performed by them:  
 
Daily analysis of the main indicators. 
 
Daily checks on the quality of the recovery. 
 
Review and answer of incidents and customer complaints. 


 
 
345 
 
In addition, periodic committees are formalized in which the management is 
evaluated and the objectives are established. 
After three months without being able to recover the client's debt, the 
Recovery Department makes a portfolio allocation to different companies 
(based on the client scoring) in order to improve the recovery efficiency.  
If finally it is not possible to solve the default situation during the following 
two months, the client is passed to the next phase. 
(3) 
Contentious: Once six (6) monthly Instalments are missed (as a general rule) 
and once the previous phases of friendly recovery of debt have been finalised, 
all debt is accelerated. The files are assigned to external companies based on 
the score assigned to the client for periods of 8 months, after which, if the 
debt has not been recovered, the file is reassigned to another company. 
Actions taken during this phase can include the initiation of legal proceedings 
before the courts. The recovery phases and strategies, as well as the outcome 
of the same, are reviewed periodically by the Risk Committee in order to 
optimise both the associated costs and the outcomes and inherent risks. 
 
Payment protection insurance 
(b)
While not a debt recovery tool as such, in the event the Borrower has taken out an 
Insurance Policy in connection with the Credit Card, he/she can present the necessary 
documentation to justify the claim via the insurance broker (depending on the 
Insurance Policy in question, the cover may include death, permanent disability, 
complete incapacity, unemployment, etc.). Once the documentation supplied has been 
reviewed and the insurance cover has been confirmed, the insurance company pays 
the amounts stipulated according to the Insurance Policy and the type of claim to (i) 
the Seller directly in order to offset the Borrower's outstanding debt, where the Seller 
is named as the beneficiary thereunder or (ii) to the Borrower, where the Borrower is 
named as the beneficiary thereunder.  
In any event, the Seller does not enforce or actively seek payment by the insurance 
companies of the Insurance Indemnification irrespective of whether it is named as the 
beneficiary thereunder or not. 
 
Refinancing and write-off 
(c)
As part of the bad debt recovery process, and once the customer has been assessed, in 
certain cases the Seller uses debt refinancing and write-offs (which in the Contentious 
phase can include write-offs of principal) as part of its Servicing Policies. Debt 
refinancing and write-offs can take place within any of the debt recovery phases 
outlined above (and on an exceptional basis, debt refinancing can take place in 
relation to Performing Client Accounts where the customer is undergoing financial 
difficulties, as a precautionary measure). The Servicing Policies, following regulatory 


 
 
346 
 
guidelines, are approved by the Board of Directors of the Seller and carried out in 
accordance with the procedures validated by the Risk Committee that are reviewed 
periodically in order to ensure that they are valid and up-to-date.  
 
Amendments to the Servicing Policies 
(d)
The Seller may change its Servicing Policies if such change is made applicable to the 
comparable segment of revolving credit accounts owned and serviced by the Seller. 
 
Management of fraud 
(e)
The Fraud Prevention Department of the Seller manages all fraud-related issues 
regarding both the origination process and the use of the credit cards. 
Fraud management is also assisted by the decision-assistance system ("systema 
experto"), which categorises unusual customer behaviours or transactions or which do 
not correspond to the normal use of the credit card by the customer, including the use 
of the credit card in stores or merchants considered as high-risk or in which there is 
an increase in the number of fraud cases. This categorisation allows the Seller to 
verify with the relevant customer those transactions in respect of which there are 
signs of potential fraud, by means of the delivery of alert notices. 
 Any fraudulent or unauthorised transaction notified by a customer is managed 
through the relevant payment system. 
In addition to the foregoing and in accordance with applicable laws, the Seller offers 
a telephone number available 24 hours any day to allow customers to request the 
cancellation of the credit card in case of loss, theft or any other circumstance which 
the customer believes may pose a risk. 
3.7.2.14.

is suitable and competent and able to perform the servicing functions in a diligent, 
efficient manner:  
(i) 
it has experience administering receivables reasonably similar to the

it is willing to enter into an agreement with the parties to the Servicing 
Agreement (other than SFC in its capacity as the Servicer) which provides for 
the Replacement Servicer to be remunerated at such a rate as is agreed by the

Upon effectiveness of the termination of the appointment of the Servicer by the 
Management Company, the Servicer shall be entitled to receive the part of the 
Servicer Fee accrued up to such date but it shall not be entitled to any other or further 
reimbursement or compensation. The sums so owed to the Servicer shall be paid by 
the Fund on the dates on which they would otherwise have been payable should no 
termination had occurred. 
The costs and expenses related to the process of appointment of the Replacement 
Servicer (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not the remuneration of the Replacement 
Servicer) shall be borne by the retiring Servicer, which shall not be entitled to set-off 
such amount with any amounts due by the Fund to the Servicer. Notwithstanding this,

correspondence and documents in its possession or under its control relating 
to the relevant Purchased Receivables and any sums and other assets, if any, 
then held by the Servicer on behalf of the Management Company; 
The Servicer shall execute such documents and take such actions as the 
Management Company may reasonably require for the purpose of enabling 
the Replacement Servicer to comply with its obligations; 
(iii) 
as soon as reasonably practicable, take such further action as the Management

preservation of the rights of the Fund on the Available Collections to be 
credited on the General Account; and

event of the substitution and replacement of the Issuer Accounts Bank pursuant to the 
terms set out in section 3.4.5 of the Additional Building Block. 
 
Any costs and expenses arising from the notification of the transfer of the Purchased 
(d)
Receivables upon the occurrence of a Servicer Termination Event shall be borne by 
the retiring Servicer. Notwithstanding this, in order to avoid any delays, the 
Management Company, at the expense of the Fund, may advance any such costs and 
expenses and request subsequently their reimbursement by the retiring Servicer.  
Regarding such costs and expenses arising from the notification of the transfer of the 
Purchased Receivables according to paragraph (b) above, they shall be borne by the

In addition, if and when the Servicer is requested to confirm or state the capacity in

The “Weighted Average Life” (WAL) of the Class [A/B/C]20xx-yy Notes refers to the average 
amount of time that will elapse from the date of issuance of the Class [A/B/C]20xx-yy Notes to the 
date of distribution to the investor of each Euro distributed in reduction of the principal of such 
security. The Weighted Average Life of the Class [A/B/C]20xx-yy Notes shall be affected by the 
available funds allocated to redeem the Class [A/B/C]20xx-yy Notes. 
The “Internal Rate of Return” (IRR) of the Class [A/B/C]20xx-yy Notes refers to the rate of return 
that makes the net present value of all cash flows (both positive and negative) from the investment in 


 
 
468 
 
the Class [A/B/C]20xx-yy Notes equal to zero. The Internal Rate of Return of the Class [A/B/C]20xx-
yy Notes shall be affected by the available funds allocated to pay interests due on the 
Class [A/B/C]20xx-yy Notes. 
The model used for the purpose of calculating estimates presented in this document employs an 
assumed constant per MPPR (as defined below). The MPPR is an assumed monthly constant rate of 
payment of principal, when applied monthly, results in the expected portfolio of the Purchased 
Receivables balance and allows to calculate the monthly principal payment. 
The information included in the tables below assume, among other things:  
 
the Disbursement Date of the Note Series 20xx-yy is []; 
(a)
 
the Scheduled Amortisation Starting Date is []; 
(b)
 
the cut-off date is [[] which is the Fund relevant Cut-Off Date prior to the issuance of such 
(c)
Notes for which an Investor Report is available /15th March 2017 corresponding to the 
reference date of the Audited Portfolio in the case of initial Note Series issued on the Fund 
Incorporation Date; 
 
that on the Disbursement Date of the Note Series 20xx-yy, the Outstanding Principal 
(d)
Balances of the Purchased Receivables is equal to the Minimum Portfolio Amount which 
amounts to [] as of such date. New Receivables are purchased (if required) in order to 
maintain such Minimum Portfolio Amount until the Scheduled Amortisation Starting Date of 
the Note Series 20xx-yy; 
 
that the composition and the amortisation profile of the portfolio of the Purchased 
(e)
Receivables (and the new Receivables purchased during the Note Series Revolving Period of 
the outstanding Note Series) is similar to the composition and amortisation profile of the 
performing portfolio as at the cut-off date; 
 
no new issuance of further Note Series occurs (however for calculation purposes, previously 
(f)
issued and outstanding Notes Series are considered); 
 
the Seller does not repurchase any Receivables purchased by the Fund; 
(g)
 
the rate of defaults on the Receivables is assumed constant at []%, which is consistent with 
(h)
the one [provided by the Management Company in the latest available Investor Report  based 
on the observed performance of the Purchased Receivables as of [] which is the Fund 
relevant Cut-Off Date prior to the issuance of such Notes for which an Investor Report is 
available / observed by the Seller in January 2017 as described in section 3.5 of the Base 
Prospectus (in the case of initial Note Series issued on the Fund Incorporation Date)]; 
 
interest payments on the Receivables will be received, if any at the applicable interest rate 
(i)
offered by SFC which as of the cut-off date stand at []%. No adjustment of the applicable 
interest rate under the Credit Card Agreements is offered by SFC; 


 
 
469 
 
 
the Fund excess margin is constant and sufficient to cover the assumed rate of defaults on the 
(j)
Receivables; 
 
a constant monthly principal payment rate (MPPR). In respect of Class [A/B/C] Notes, the 
(k)
assumed MPPR is: (i) []% in respect of scenario 1; (ii) []% in respect of scenario 2; and 
(iii) []% in respect of scenario 3, according to the following tables. These scenarios have 
been defined based on the observed performance of the Purchased Receivables as of [] 
which is the Fund relevant Cut-Off Date prior to the issuance of such Notes / historic 
information provided by the Seller in January 2017 as described in section 3.5 of the Base 
Prospectus (in the case of initial Note Series issued on the Fund Incorporation Date)];  
 
the calculation of the weighted average life (in years) is calculated on an Actual/Actual basis; 
(l)
 
the Note Series 20xx-yy Clean-Up Call Conditions will not be considered applicable;  
(m)
 
none of the Fund Liquidation Events are considered applicable; 
(n)
 
payment of principal and interest due and payable under the Notes will be received on 
(o)
the 26th day of each corresponding Payment Date;  
 
zero per cent investment return is earned on the Issuer Accounts; 
(p)
 
no Revolving Termination Event has occurred; 
(q)
 
no Accelerated Amortisation Event has occurred; and  
(r)
 
it is not necessary to use the Commingling Reserve or the General Reserve. 
(s)
The actual characteristics and performance of the Purchased Receivables will differ from the 
assumptions used in constructing the tables set forth below, which are hypothetical in nature and 
provided only to give a general sense of how the principal cash flows might behave under varying 
monthly rate of principal payment scenarios. For example, it is unlikely that the receivables will pay 
at a constant monthly rate of principal payment until maturity. Any difference between such 
assumptions and the actual characteristics and performance of the Purchased Receivables, or actual 
monthly rate of principal payment of loss experiences, will affect the percentage of principal amount 
outstanding as well as interest payment over time and the Weighted Average Life and Internal Rate of 
Return of the Class [A/B/C]20xx-yy Notes. 
Subject to the foregoing discussion and assumptions, the following tables indicate the Weighted 
Average Life, Duration and the Internal Rate of Return of the Class [A/B/C]20xx-yy Notes under the 
constant MPPR shown and depending on the exercise of the optional redemption of the Note 
Series 20xx-yy on the Note Series 20xx-yy Call Date.
