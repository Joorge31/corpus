Structure of assets of the Fund: credit rights held by the Assignors on loans by the Assignors granted to provide private 
individuals with the funds to acquire, build or renovate residential properties directly, or else for private individuals to 
subrogate to funding granted to property developers for building or renovating residential properties for sale or to let 
and in Spain (the "Mortgage Loans”). 
 
The credit rights shall be instrumented as an issue by the Assignors and a subscription by the Fund, when the Fund is 
set up, of (i) mortgage securities (the "Mortgage Securities") in accordance with the terms of the Mortgage Market 
Rules Act, Law 2/1981, dated 25 March, and its enacting regulations and (ii) mortgage transfer certificates (the 
"Mortgage Transfer Certificates" and, jointly with the Mortgage Securities, "the Mortgage Securities and 
Certificates" or the "Assets") in accordance with the terms of Additional Provision Five of Law 3/1994 as worded in 
Section 18 of the Measures to Reform the Financial System Act, Law 44/2002, dated 22 November ("Law 44/2002”). 
 
Each Security and Certificate shall refer to a 100% holding in the principal outstanding on each of the Mortgage Loans 
which are instrumented thereby, and shall earn interest at a rate equal to the nominal rate accruing at the time on the 
corresponding Mortgage Loan. 
 
Structure of the portfolio of loans from which the Mor gage Securities and the Mortgage Transfer Certificates are to be
issued (the Portfolio of Securitisable Mortgage Loans”): 4,739 mortgage loans granted to provide private 
individuals with the funds to acquire, build or renovate residential properties directly, or else for private individuals to 
subrogate to funding granted to property developers to build or renovate residential properties for sale or to let on 
Spanish territory, with an outstanding balance, as at 29 March 2005, of 425,282,276.71 euros. Of these loans:  
 
2 


 
 
 
(a) 
3,021 loans (with an outstanding balance as at 29 March 2005 that amounted to 303,577,597.65 euros) meet 
the requirements laid down in Section II of the Mortgage Market Act, Law 2/1981 and in Chapter II of Royal 
Decree 685/1982, dated 17 March, regarding the rules governing certain aspects of the Mortgage Market, as 
modified by Royal Decree 1289/1991, dated 2 August (“Royal Decree 685/1982”). Only the Mortgage 
Loans that are selected on the date the Fund is set up from among the above (which shall hereinafter be 
referred to as "Mortgage Loans PH") shall be used as cover for the Mortgage Security issue.  
 
(b) 
1,718 loans (with an outstanding balance as at 29 March 2005 that amounted to 121,704,679.06 euros) fail 
to meet some of the requirements laid down in Section II of the Mortgage Market Act, Law 2/1981 and in 
Chapter II of Royal Decree 685/1982. The Mortgage Loans that are selected on the date the Fund is set up 
from among the above (which shall hereinafter be referred to as "Mortgage Loans CH") shall be used as 
cover for the Mortgage Transfer Certificate issue.  
 
On the date the Fund is set up, the Assignors shall proceed to select the Mortgage Loans which are to be the object of 
the Mortgage Securities and Certificates. 
 
The Portfolio of Securitisable Loans has been audited by the firm PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS AUDITORES, S.L.

amount of the Assets) be less than 370,000,000 euros.

Approximate nature of cer ain information: all the information set out in this Prospectus concerning the hypothesis 
adopted to illustrate the payments of interest, repayments of principal, average lives and returns and tables of cash 
flow are solely for the sake of information, aimed at illustrating the issue's financial structure, and should be taken as 
no more than a guideline. 
t

Non-performing loans: the risk of late-payment and non-payment of the Mortgage Loans and, hence, of the Mortgage 
Securities and Certificates shall be for the account of the holders of the Securities issued. 
 
Risk of early redemption o the Mortgage Securities and Cer ifica es: the Mortgage Securities and Certificates shall be 
redeemed early when the debtors of the Mortgage Loans (the "Debtors") repay their outstanding capital early. The risk 
involved in such early redemption shall be transferred to the holders of the Securities issued on every Payment Date, by 
redeeming part of the Securities. 
 
Risk of early redemption of the issue as a result of the Fund being liquidated early: the Managing Company, after 
notifying the CNMV, is empowered to liquidate the Fund early and redeem all the Securities issued early, on a Payment 
Date, if less that 10% of the initial balance of the portfolio of Securities and Certificates has yet to be paid. Likewise, 
under the terms of Article 19 of Royal Decree 926/1998, if the Managing Company is put into liquidation, goes into 
bankruptcy proceedings, or its authorisation were to be revoked and a new managing company fails to be appointed 
within 4 months, the Fund may be liquidated early and the Securities issued be redeemed early. 
 
Limited liquidity: there is no guarantee of any minimum frequency or volume for the Securities issued traded on the 
market. There is no undertaking for any other entity to intervene in the secondary trading, providing liquidity for the 
Securities in a counterparty offer. 
 
Return for the subscribers of the Securities: the early repayment of the Mortgage Loans is influenced by geographical, 
economic and social factors (seasonal changes, market interest rate, etc.) which mean that it cannot be forecast. The 
calculations included in the Prospectus for internal rate of return, average life and duration of the Securities issued are 
subject to assumptions made for rates of early repayments and non-performance for the Mortgage Loans that may not 
actually be the case.

Royal Decree 116/1992, dated 14 February, regarding the representation of securities 
by means of entries in account and clearing and settling stock market operations (the 
"Royal Decree 116/1992"), the deed where the representation of the Securities by 
entries in account is recorded must be, whenever appropriate, the deed of issue. 
 
II.1.2 
Information about the prerequisites and prior decisions for admission to be 
traded in the Stock Exchange or an organised secondary market 
 
The Managing Company shall, acting as the representative and for the account of the 
Fund, apply for the Securities issue to be included in the Fixed-Income Market ("AIAF 
Mercado de Renta Fija" (“AIAF”)), the official secondary securities market recognised 
in Transitional Provision Six of Law 37/1998 dated 16 November, which modified Law 
24/1988. The final admission for trading is expected to take place no later than thirty 
(30) days after the Pay-in Date. 
 
In the event that the Securities are not accepted for trading in AIAF within said 
period, the Managing Company shall inform the holders of the Securities and the 
CNMV immediately, specifying the reasons for this not having happened, by publishing 
an announcement in a nationally distributed newspaper, in accordance with the terms 
of section III.5.3, all of which notwithstanding any contractual liability which may 
arise for the Managing Company as a result of said non-performance. 
 
The Managing Company shall also, representing and for the account of the Fund, 
apply for the Securities to be included in the SOCIEDAD DE GESTIÓN DE LOS 
SISTEMAS DE REGISTRO, COMPENSACIÓN Y LIQUIDACIÓN DE VALORES, S.A. (the 
“SYSTEMS COMPANY”) (or the entity which may, eventually, replace it), so that the 
Securities shall be cleared and settled in accordance with the operating rules which 
are laid down or may be laid down in the future by the SYSTEMS COMPANY (or the 
16 


 
 
 
entity which may, eventually, replace it) for securities listed on the AIAF market 
represented by entries in account). 
 
II.2 
Prior administrative authorisation for the issue or offer 
 
No other prior administrative clearance is required for the Securities issue apart from 
the prior registration of the Prospectus in the CNMV official registers. 
 
II.3 
Assessment of the risk inherent in the securities issued charged to the 
Fund, made by a Rating Agency recognised by the National Securities 
Exchange Commission ("CNMV") 
 
The Managing Company has given MOODY’S INVESTORS SERVICE ESPAÑA, S. A. 
("MOODY’S INVESTORS SERVICE ESPAÑA, S.A.”), a Spanish company 100% 
part of MOODY’S INVESTORS SERVICE LIMITED (“MOODY’S” or the "Rating 
Agency"), a rating agency recognised by the CNMV for the purposes of the terms of 
Article 2.3.b) of Royal Decree 926/1998, the job of setting a credit rating for the 
Securities. 
 
Rating given to the Securities issue 
 
Before this Prospectus was entered in the official registers of the CNMV, MOODY’S 
INVESTORS SERVICE ESPAÑA has given the Securities the following ratings, all of 
which are provisional: 
 
 
MOODY'S PROVISIONAL RATING 
Tranche A Bonds 
Aaa 
Tranche B Bonds 
Baa3 
Security IO 
Aaa 
 
The above ratings are expected to be confirmed as final ratings before the 
Subscription Period for the Securities begins (referred to in Section II.18.3 of the 
Prospectus). 
 
In the event that the Rating Agency were not to confirm its provisional ratings 
indicated hereabove as final by the beginning of the Subscription Period, the CNMV 
would be immediately notified accordingly and this would be made public in the 
manner provided for in section III.5.3. 
 
Failure on the part of the Rating Agency to confirm the above provisional ratings as 
final before the Subscription Period begins would constitute a termination event 
resolving the formation of the Fund, the assignment of the Assets and the issuing of 
the Securities. 
 
17 


 
 
 
A copy of the letter of provisional rating of MOODY’S INVESTORS SERVICE ESPAÑA is 
attached as Appendix III. 
 
Considerations as regards the rating 
 
Set out below are MOODY'S scales of ratings for long-term debt issues: 
 
LONG-TERM 
Aaa 
Aa 
A 
Baa 
Ba 
B 
Caa 
Ca 
C 
 
MOODY'S applies number modifiers 1, 2 and 3 to each long-term rating category from 
Aa to Caa. Modifier 1 indicates securities in the top band of the rating category, 
modifier 2 indicates the middle band and modifier 3 indicates securities in the bottom 
band of each generic category. 
 
Set out below are MOODY'S scale of ratings for short-term debt issues: 
 
SHORT-TERM 
Prime-1 
Prime-2 
Prime-3 
Not Prime 
 
Set out below is a description of the definition given by MOODY'S to the long- and 
short-term ratings used in this Prospectus. 
 
Long-term 
 
Aaa 
Securities rated Aaa are in the top rating and have the lowest investment 
risk. Interest payments are covered by a wide or exceptionally stable spread 
and there is certainty as to the collection of the principal. Although the 
elements of security are likely to change, this is not expected to alter the 
fundamental soundness of these issues. 
 
Baa 
Securities rated Baa are deemed to be of medium quality (they are neither 
very safe nor poorly backed). Interest payments and repayments of principal 
18 


 
 
 
are deemed to be adequately protected, although some elements of security 
may either not exist or be unreliable in the long term. These securities fail to 
qualify as top-quality investment instruments and in fact also have 
speculative features.  
 
Short-term 
 
Prime-1  
(P-1) the issues (or underwriting institutions) classed as P-1 are highly 
capable of meeting their debt commitments issued for terms of less than 
one year. . The solvency associated with P-1 issuers will often be shown by 
the following characteristics: 1) leading position in sound sectors, 2) high 
rates of return on the funds used, 3) conservative capital structure, resorting 
only moderately to the debt market and well protected assets, 4) wide 
margins on the cover of the fixed financial charge by profits and a high 
internal rate of return, 5) sound ability to access the financial markets and 
alternative sources of guaranteed liquidity. 
 
Ratings are an opinion of the Rating Agency regarding expectations of the loss of the 
Securities, not recommendations to buy or sell, and their accuracy is not guaranteed. 
A rating is but one more factor to take into account when making an investment 
decision. A study and assessment of the issuer whose securities are being considered 
for purchase or sale needs to be made. The rating of the Rating Agency takes the 
structure of the Securities issue into account, as well as its legal aspects and those of 
the Fund, the characteristics of the Assets and the extent to which the flow of the 
operation are regular and constant. 
 
The MOODY'S rating for this operation measures the expected loss prior to the Legal 
Date of Maturity of the Fund. In MOODY'S opinion, the structure allows interest to be 
paid and principal to be repaid on time during the life of the operation and, in any 
case, by the Legal Date of Maturity. 
 
The rating of the Ratings Agency does not assess the probability of the Assigned 
Debtors repaying principal early, nor the extent to which such early repayments differ 
from the original forecasts. The ratings are not in any way to be taken as a rating of 
the level of actuarial return. 
 
The ratings assigned, as well as any revision or suspension thereof: 
 
(i) 
are drawn up by the Rating Agency based on the large amount of information it 
receives. The Rating Agency does not guarantee that they are either accurate or 
comprehensive. The Rating Agency therefore cannot be deemed in any way 
responsible therefore; 
 
19 


 
 
 
(ii) they do not constitute and in no way could they be construed as an invitation, 
recommendation or incitement to investors to proceed to carry out any operation 
of any kind on the Securities and, in particular, to buy, hold, encumber or sell 
said Securities; and 
 
(iii) they do not reflect either market conditions or the needs that any particular 
investor might have. 
 
The ratings assigned may be revised, suspended or withdrawn at any time by the 
Rating Agency on the basis of any information that may come to its knowledge or any 
lack of information. Such situations, which do not constitute events triggering off the 
early redemption of the Fund, shall be made known immediately to the CNMV and to 
the holders of the Securities, in accordance with the terms of section III.5.3. 
 
When carrying out the rating and monitoring process, the Rating Agency relies on the 
information provided to it by the Managing Company, the auditors, the lawyers and 
other experts being accurate and comprehensive. 
 
The Managing Company, representing the Fund, undertakes to provide the Rating 
Agency, within one month after the end of every Payment Date, with information 
about the situation of the Fund and the performance of the Mortgage Securities and 
Certificates during the Interest Accrual Period ending on said Payment Date. It shall 
also provide such information whenever it is reasonably called upon to do so and, in 
any case, whenever there is a change in the conditions of the Fund, in the contracts it 
has entered into through the Managing Company, or in the interested parties. 
 
The Managing Company shall use its best efforts to ensure that the rating for the 
Securities remain at its initial level and, in the event that such rating were to fall, to 
bring it back up.

II.4 
Nature and name of the securities that are offered, indicating the issue or 
series number 
 
The total amount of the Bond issue amounts to THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY 
MILLION EUROS (€ 370,000,000) in nominal value, consisting of THREE THOUSAND 
SEVEN HUNDRED (3,700) Bonds bundled together into two Tranches: 
 
(i) 
Tranche A (the “Tranche A Bonds”), consisting of THREE THOUSAND FOUR 
HUNDRED AND TWENTY-TWO (3,422) Bonds, each with a unit nominal value 
of ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND EUROS (€ 100,000), represented by entries in 
account, for a total nominal amount of THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY-TWO 
MILLION, TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND EUROS (€ 342,200,000). 
 
(ii) 
Tranche B (the “Tranche B Bonds”), consisting of TWO HUNDRED AND 
SEVENTY-EIGHT (278) Bonds, each with a unit nominal value of ONE 
HUNDRED THOUSAND EUROS (€ 100,000), represented by entries in account, 
for a total nominal amount of TWENTY-SEVEN MILLION, EIGHT HUNDRED 
THOUSAND EUROS (€ 27,800,000). 
 
Interest payments and the repayment of principal on the Tranche B Bonds shall be 
made only when interest payments and the repayment of principal have been made 
on the Tranche A Bonds, in accordance with the payment priority order set out in 
section V.5.1.B)2 of the Prospectus (the "Payment Priority Order"). 
 
Furthermore, part of the interest on the Tranche A Bonds, shall be segregated, on the 
date the Fund is set up, in a separate fixed-income security called the "Security IO"), 
in accordance with the terms of section II.10.4 herebelow. 
 
Subscribing to or holding Bonds in one Tranche does not imply subscribing to or 
holding Bonds of another Tranche. 
 
Subscribing to or holding Bonds in any of the Tranches does not imply subscribing to 
or holding Fixed-Income Securities IO. 
 
II.4.1 
Legal rules governing the securities, specifying the procedures that 
guarantee that the rights of their first and subsequent holders are certain 
and effective. Implications caused by the required linking of the schedule of 
repayments of principals and payments of interest on said securities and 
the flows of income and collections from the assets being securitised via 
the Fund on the financial servicing of each of the Tranches of Securities 
issued charged to the Fund 
 
The Securities are regarded legally as tradable simple fixed-income securities with 
explicit returns. 
21 


 
 
 
 
The fact that they are simple fixed-income securities means that the Securities shall 
be subject to the rules laid down for such securities in Law 24/1998 and they shall be 
represented by entries in account. 
 
The holders of the Securities issued shall be identified as such according to the 
accounting record kept by the SYSTEMS COMPANY, as provided for in section II.5 of 
this Chapter. The related certificates may be issued by the corresponding participating 
entity at the request and expense of the holder of the Securities, in accordance with 
the terms of Royal Decree 116/1992, Title I, Chapter 1, section four 116/1992.  
 
The Securities may be freely transferred by any legally acceptable means and in 
accordance with the rules of the market where they are listed. Title to each Security 
shall be transferred by accounting transfer. The registration of the transfer to the 
acquirer in the accounting record shall have the same effect as the transfer of the 
certificates and the transfer shall, as from that moment in time, be enforceable with 
regard to third parties. 
 
Any limited rights in rem or any other kind of encumbrance on the Securities must be 
entered in the appropriate account. The registration of the pledge shall be equivalent 
to the transfer of possession of the title. The setting up of the encumbrance shall 
become enforceable with regard to third parties as from when the corresponding 
registration has been made. 
 
The Managing Company, under the terms of Article 3.3 of Royal Decree 926/1998 and 
Article 5.7 of Law 19/1992, representing and for the account of the Fund, shall enter 
into a Financial Service Agreement with the CONFEDERACIÓN ESPAÑOLA DE CAJAS 
DE AHORROS (hereinafter referred to as the “Financial Agent”) under which, with a 
view to hedge against any time lags that may arise between the schedule of the 
repayments of the principal and payments of interest on the Loans, and the schedule 
of the Securities issued, the balance of the Cash Account may be invested on a short-
term basis (until the following Calculation Date) by acquiring fixed-income assets with 
terms that are shorter than the time remaining until the next Calculation Date that 
falls after the date on which the current-asset investment is made, denominated in 
euros, issued by issuers with ratings of at least P-1 (on the MOODY'S scale) for short-
term risks, provided that the return on the fixed-income assets in which the current-
asset investment is made is, net of charges and other expenses, at least, equal to the 
guaranteed minimum rate of the balance of the Cash Account (arithmetical average of 
the Average Interbank Rates for the interest accrual period less thirty-five (35) basis 
points). In the event that the assets in which said current-asset investment is made 
are repos, the counterparty of the repo operation must have a rating of at least P-1 
(on the MOODY'S scale) for short-term risks. 
 
22 


 
 
 
For these purposes, the Average Interbank Rate is defined as the average rate of 
non-transferrable, interbank deposit operations, exchanged between credit institutions 
overnight, and published by the Gazette of the Centre of Entries of the Bank of Spain 
on the following day. 
 
II.4.2 
Other implications and risks which, due to the legal and financial nature of 
the assets bundled together in the Fund, could affect the financial servicing 
of the Securities charged against the Fund as a result of the process of 
securitising said assets 
 
a) 
Risk of non-payment of the Mortgage Securities and Certificates 
 
In accordance with the terms of Chapter V, the holders of the Securities charged 
against the Fund shall run the risk of any non-payment of the Mortgage Securities and 
Certificates bundled together therein. 
 
Consequently, the Assignors shall assume no liability whatsoever for any non-payment 
by the Debtors, be it of the principal, the interest or any other amount they may owe 
by virtue of the Mortgage Loans. Neither shall they assume any liability whatsoever 
for guaranteeing directly or indirectly the success of the operation, nor shall they give 
any guarantees, nor shall they enter into any agreements to repurchase the Securities 
or the Certificates, except for those which, on the date the Fund is set up, fail to meet 
the conditions and characteristics set out in section IV.1.a) of the Prospectus and in 
the Formation Deed, in which case the terms of section IV.1.d) hereof shall apply. 
 
b) 
Risk of early redemption of the Mortgage Securities and Certificates 
 
The Mortgage Securities and Certificates bundled together in the Fund may be 
redeemed early when the Debtors repay the outstanding part of the principal early, in 
accordance with the terms set out in each of the deeds whereby said Loans were 
granted.  
 
The risk of early redemption of the Securities and/or the Certificates as described in 
the previous paragraph shall be transferred to the holders of the Securities on a 
regular basis, on every Payment Date, by partially redeeming them, in accordance 
with the terms of section II.11.3.2 of the Prospectus and in the Formation Deed. 
 
c) 
Liquidity Risk 
 
There is no guarantee of any minimum frequency or volume for the Securities traded 
on the market. 
 
There is no undertaking for any other entity to intervene in the secondary trading, 
providing liquidity for the Securities in a counterparty offer. 
23 


 
 
 
 
d) 
Performance 
 
The early repayment of the Mortgage Loans is influenced by geographical, economic 
and social factors, such as seasonal changes, market interest rate, the employment 
and financial situation of the Debtors and the general level of economic activity, which 
mean that it cannot be forecast.  
 
The calculations included in the Prospectus for internal rate of return, average life and 
duration of the Securities are subject, inter alia, to assumptions made for rates of 
early repayments and non-performance for the Mortgage Loans that may not actually 
be the case.  
 
e) 
Late-payment interest 
 
Under no circumstances shall any delay in the payment of interest or the repayment 
of principal to the holders of the Securities entitle them to any late-payment interest 
(except as provided in section II.10.3). 
 
f) 
Limited protection 
 
The expectations of collecting on the Mortgage Securities and Certificates are subject 
to the credit, liquidity, interest rate and other exposures that affect the Mortgage 
Loans that underlay these Securities and Certificates and, in general, shall vary 
depending, among other factors, on market interest rates, general economic 
conditions, the financial situation of the Debtors and other similar factors. Although 
there are systems for enhancing the credit for the Securities, the credit enhancement 
is limited. In the event that, as a result of non-performance reaching high levels for 
the Mortgage Loans, the credit enhancement for a Security fall to zero (0), the 
Assignors shall not be required to cover said reduction, and the holders of the 
Securities affected shall directly bear the credit exposure and any other risks relating 
to their investment in the Fund. 
 
II.5 
Method of representation and name and address of the entity responsible 
for keeping the accounting record of the Securities 
 
The Securities shall be represented solely by entries in account and shall be set up as 
such by virtue of their entry in the corresponding accounting record. The Formation 
Deed shall have the effects provided for in Section 6 of Law 24/1988. 
 
In compliance with the terms of Article 6 of Royal Decree 116/1992, the name, 
number of units, nominal value and all the other characteristics and conditions of the 
issue of Securities that are represented by entries in account is as set out in the 
Formation Deed and in this Chapter II.

The holders of the Securities shall be identified as such as shown in the accounting 
record kept by the entities that are members of the SYSTEMS COMPANY, which shall 
be designated as the entity responsible for keeping the accounting record of the 
Securities in the Formation Deed so that the clearance and settlement of the 
Securities shall be carried out in accordance with the operating rules which have been 
laid down, or may be approved in the future by the SYSTEMS COMPANY (or whatever 
entity may replace it in the future) for securities listed on the AIAF and represented by 
entries in account).  
 
The SYSTEMS COMPANY, a Spanish public limited company ("sociedad anónima"), set 
up in accordance with the terms of Section One, paragraph one of the Measures for

Rate") shall be paid quarterly on every Payment Date, on the Balance of the Principal 
Outstanding of each Bond on the preceding Calculation Date, provided that the Fund 
has 
sufficient 
Funds 
Available 
in 
accordance 
with 
the  
Payment Priority Order provided for in section V.5.1.B)2 of the Prospectus. 
 
27 


 
 
 
a) 
Accrual of interest 
 
The term of the Securities issue shall be divided into successive periods of time (all 
together, the “Interest Accrual Periods” and each one of them, an “Interest 
Accrual Period”) consisting of the days that effectively elapse between each 
Payment Date, where each Interest Accrual Period includes the initial Payment Date 
and excludes the final Payment Date. 
 
Exceptionally, the first Interest Accrual Period shall have a length different to a 
quarter, equal to the time between the Pay-in Date (included) and the first Payment 
Date, which shall fall on 21 September 2005 (not included). 
 
b)  
Nominal Interest Rate 
 
The Nominal Interest Rate set for each Interest Accrual Period shall be the sum of:  
 
(i) 
the benchmark three-(3)-month Euribor interest rate (except for the first 
Interest Accrual Period, which shall be the result of a straight-line interpolation 
between the benchmark four-(4)-month Euribor rate and the benchmark five-
(5)-month Euribor rate, taking into account the number of days of the first 
Interest Accrual Period) or, whenever necessary, whatever rate may replace it

herebelow. 
 
28 


 
 
 
c) 
Setting the benchmark interest rate 
 
(i) 
The benchmark interest rate for setting the Nominal Interest Rate applying to 
the Bonds shall be the "three-(3)-month from maturity Euribor rate", 
defined as the three-(3)-month from maturity Euribor rate “Euro InterBank 
Offered Rate”, calculated and distributed by the BRIDGE financial information 
system under the mandate of the FBE (“Fédération Bancaire de l’Union 
Européenne”), set at 11:00 a.m. (CET) on the Date for Setting the Interest Rate 
(described in paragraph d) below), which is currently being published on the 
electronic pages EURIBOR01, provided by Reuters and 248, provided by Dow 
Jones Markets (Bridge Telerate) or any other page that might replace them for 
these services. 
 
The Euribor rate is currently the term Euro Interbank Offered Rate calculated as 
the daily average of the rates provided by a panel consisting of 57 Banks, 
among the most active in the Euro Zone. The rate is listed on the basis of the 
calculation of the real days to maturity and a 360-day year and is set at 11:00 
a.m. (CET), expressed to three (3) decimal places. 
 
For the purposes hereof, “CET” (“Central European Time”) shall be understood 
as being Central European Time, which is the official time used in the city of 
Brussels. 
 
Exceptionally the benchmark interest rate for the first Interest Accrual Period 
shall be the result of a straight-line interpolation between the benchmark four-
(4)-month Euribor interest rate and the benchmark five-(5)-month Euribor 
interest rate, taking into account the number of days of the first Interest 
Accrual Period.  
 
For these purposes, shall be defined as follows:  
 
a. 
The "Four-(4)-month Euribor” shall be deemed to be the four (4) 
month from maturity Euribor rate, “Euro InterBank Offered Rate”, 
calculated and distributed by the BRIDGE financial information system 
under the mandate of the FBE (“Fédération Bancaire de l’Union 
Européenne”) set at 11:00 a.m. (CET) on the second (2nd) last Business 
Day prior to the Pay-In Date. 
 
b. 
The "Five-(5)-month Euribor” shall be deemed to be the five (5) month 
from maturity Euribor rate, “Euro InterBank Offered Rate”, calculated and 
distributed by the BRIDGE financial information system under the mandate 
of the FBE (“Fédération Bancaire de l’Union Européenne”) set at 11:00 
a.m. (CET) on the second (2nd) last Business Day prior to the Pay-In Date. 
 
29 


 
 
 
To calculate the benchmark interest rate for the first Interest Accrual Period the 
following formula shall be used: 
 
TCa = [(TL – TC) /(DL - DC) * (DCa - DC)] + TC 
 
Where, 
 
TCa  
= the benchmark interest rate for the first Interest Accrual Period 
(expressed as a percentage), 
TL  
= the benchmark five-(5)-month Euribor interest rate, expressed as a 
percentage, 
TC  
= the benchmark four-(4)-month Euribor interest rate, expressed as a 
percentage, 
DL  
= 150, 
DC  
= 120 and 
DCa  
= the number of days in the first Interest Accrual Period. 
 
(ii) 
In the event that it prove impossible to obtain the rate set in paragraph (i) 
hereabove, the replacement benchmark interest rate shall be the interest rate 
resulting from making the simple arithmetical mean of the interbank offered 
rates of interest for non-transferable deposit operations, in euros, at three (3) 
months to maturity, on the Date for Setting the Interest Rate, which are 
declared by the banks listed below (the "Benchmark Entities") when every 
one of them is simultaneously requested to do so by the Managing Company 
through the Financial Agent (except for the first Interest Accrual Period, for 
which the result taken shall be a straight-line interpolation between (i) the 
simple arithmetical mean of the interbank offered rates of interest for non-
transferable deposit operations, in euros, at four (4) months to maturity and (ii) 
the simple arithmetical mean of the interbank offered rates of interest for non-
transferable deposit operations, in euros, at five (5) months to maturity, as 
declared by the Benchmark Entities on the second last Business Day prior to the 
Pay-In Date). 
 
The Benchmark Entities shall be:

• BANCO SANTANDER CENTRAL HISPANO, S.A.  
• CONFEDERACIÓN ESPAÑOLA DE CAJAS DE AHORROS 
• DEUTSCHE BANK AG 
 
In the event that it prove impossible to apply the replacement benchmark rate 
referred to hereabove, because one or more of the Benchmark Entities does not 
provide a statement of rates, on a constant basis, the interest rate that results 
30 


 
 
 
from applying the simple arithmetical mean of the interest rates that have been 
declared by at least two (2) of the other Benchmark Entities shall apply. 
 
(iii) 
In the absence of or should it prove impossible to obtain the interest rates 
provided for in paragraphs (i) and (ii) hereabove, the latest benchmark interest 
rate applied to the latest Interest Accrual Period shall apply and so on for 
successive Interest Accrual Periods for as long as this situation continues to 
apply. 
 
(iv) 
In the event that it proves impossible to obtain the rates set in paragraphs (i) 
and (ii) hereabove, the benchmark rate applying to the first Interest Accrual 
Period shall be the result of the lineal interpolation of (i) the arithmetical 
average of the rates offered for loans in euros, for amounts similar to the 
outstanding balance of the Mortgage Securities and Certificates and for a term 
of four (4) months and (ii) the arithmetical average of the rates offered for 
loans in euros, for amounts similar to the outstanding balance of the Mortgage 
Securities and Certificates and for a term of five (5) months by four (4) top 
Banks in the euro zone, chosen by the Managing Company, to other to Banks in 
the euro zone at approximately 11:00 a.m. on the second last Business Day 
prior to the Pay-In Date. 
 
The Managing Company shall keep the lists of the content of the Reuters EURIBOR01 
and Telerate 248 screens (or any screen or screens that may replace them in the 
future) or, as applicable, the statements of rates made by the Benchmark Entities or 
by Banks chosen by the Managing Company in accordance with the terms of 
paragraph (iv) hereabove, as documentary proof of the benchmark interest rate set. 
 
d) 
Date for Setting the Interest Rate 
 
The Nominal Interest Rate applying to the Bonds in all the Tranches for each Interest 
Accrual Period shall be set by the Managing Company, representing and for the 
account of the Fund, at 11:00 a.m. (CET) on the second (2nd) Business Day prior to 
each Payment Date (hereinafter referred to as the "Date for Setting the Interest 
Rate") and shall apply for the following Interest Accrual Period.

Saturday or Sunday. 
 
The Nominal Interest Rate for Bonds in each of the Tranches for the first Interest 
Accrual Period shall be set as provided for in paragraph c) hereabove, based on the 
interpolation of the benchmark interest rates indicated in said paragraph (four-(4)-
month Euribor and five-(5)-month Euribor) at 11:00 a.m. (CET) on the second last 
31

II.10.2 Simple mention of the order number in the Fund's payment priority of the 
interest payments of the securities issued charged to the Fund, and a 
precise indication of the section and pages of this Prospectus where the 
priority rules set for the Fund's payments are described, and specifically 
those that affect the interest payments on said securities. 
 
The payment of interest due on the Tranche A Bonds, and the Payment IO comes in 
3rd place, in accordance with the Payment Priority Order set in section V.5.1.B)2 of 
the Prospectus. 
  
The payment of interest due on the Tranche B Bonds comes in 4th place, in 
accordance with the Payment Priority Order set in section V.5.1.B)2 of the Prospectus. 
Furthermore, the interest payments owed on the Tranche B Bonds may be put back in 
the event that the Fund is liquidated, in accordance with the terms of sections V.5.2.1.
  
 
II.10.3 Dates, place, entities and procedure for paying the interest 
 
The interest on the Securities issued shall be paid at the end of every quarter, on 21 
March, June, September and December every year, until they have been fully 
redeemed (each of these dates, a "Payment Date") using the procedure described in 
section II.12 hereof.  
 
In the event that any of the dates set in the previous paragraph were not a Business 
Day, the Payment Date shall be the next Business Day immediately thereafter, and 
the interest corresponding to the current Interest Accrual Period shall accrue up to but 
not including said first Business Day. 
 
The settlement of interest on the Bonds in all the Tranches shall be calculated in 
accordance with the following rules: 
 
(i) 
The interest on the Bonds in Tranche B and on the Bonds in Tranche A, which 
must be paid on each Payment Date for each Interest Accrual Period shall be 
calculated using the following formula:

d =  
The number of effective days corresponding to each Interest Accrual 
Period. 
 
(ii) 
In addition to the interest calculated in accordance with point (i) hereabove, 
every Fixed-Income Security IO shall accrue the Payment IO (which shall be 
paid to the holders of the Fixed-Income Securities IO), which shall be calculated 
using the following formula:

equal, at any moment in time, to the result of dividing the Reference 
Amount of the Security IO (as defined in section II.10.4 hereabove) by 
the number of Fixed-Income Securities IO.  
Ri = 
0.75% (except for the first five Payment Dates, when it shall be 2.5%).  
d =  
The number of effective days corresponding to each Interest Accrual 
Period. 
 
When calculating the interest accruing in any Interest Accrual Period, account shall be 
taken of (i) the effective days in each interest accrual period and (ii) a three-hundred-
and-sixty (360) day year. 
 
The interest accruing to the holders of the Securities issued, calculated as provided for 
hereabove, and any amount of the interest accrued and not paid there may be, shall 
be notified in the manner described in section III .5.3 hereof, at least one (1) 
Business Day before each Payment Date. 
 
The payment of the interest accrued on the Securities shall be made on each Payment 
Date, provided that the Fund has sufficient cash reserves to make said payment, in 
accordance with the Payment Priority Order provided for in section V.5.1.b)2 hereof. 
 
34 


 
 
 
In the event that, on a Payment Date, the Funds Available to the Fund were 
insufficient to pay all the interest accrued on the Securities issued, in accordance with 
the terms of section V.5.1.B)2 hereof, the amount available for paying interest on the 
Securities shall be shared according to the payment priority orders provided for in said 
section and in the event that the Funds Available were only enough to meet part of 
the obligations in the same payment priority order, separately for each one of them, 
the amount available shall be shared among the Securities affected, in proportion to 
the Balance of Principal Outstanding thereon, and any amounts that have failed to be 
paid to the holders of the Securities shall be paid on the next Payment Date on which 
payment becomes possible. The amounts of interest deferred shall accrue interest to 
the holders at the same rate as applied to the Securities concerned during the Interest 
Accrual Period(s) that have elapsed up to the Payment Date on which they are paid, 
with no late-payment interest and without this implying any capitalisation of the debt. 
In this regard, the Payment IO shall be deemed to be interest on the Bonds in 
Tranche A, as a result of which the amount assigned shall be distributed among the 
Bonds in Tranche A and the Fixed-Income Securities IO in proportion to the amounts 
owed under these headings. 
 
The Fund, through the Managing Company, may not defer payment of interest on the 
Securities beyond 21 March 2038 or, should it not be a Business Day, the next 
Business Day thereafter ("Legal Maturity Date”). 
 
The withholdings, payments on account and taxes that have been set or shall be set 
in the future, on the principal, interest or earnings of the Securities, shall be paid for 
entirely by the holders of the Securities and their amount shall be deducted, whenever 
applicable, by the Managing Company, acting as the representative and for the 
account of the Fund, through the Financial Agent, in the manner provided for by law. 
 
The financial servicing of the Securities issue shall be made through the Financial 
Agent (which, as indicated in section II.4.I, is the CONFEDERACIÓN ESPAÑOLA DE 
CAJAS DE AHORROS), which shall sign the Financial Services Agreement with the 
Managing Company, representing and acting for the account of the Fund. 
 
In order to make it easier for subscribers to understand the system for setting the 
applicable Nominal Interest Rate and the amount of the interest corresponding to 
each Security issued on each Payment Date, a practical case is included in section 
II.12. as an example, together with the theoretical tables of the financial servicing of 
the debt. 
 
II.10.4 Segregation of the Bonds in Tranche A (Security IO) 
 
Part of the interest on the Bonds in Tranche A shall be segregated, on the date the 
Fund is set up, in a separate fixed-income security called the "Security IO"). 
 
35 


 
 
 
The Security IO shall be made up of 3,422 Fixed-Income Securities IO (the same as 
the number of Bonds in Tranche A), represented by entries in account, the total 
subscription price of which shall not be set finally until the date the Fund is set up and 
shall be between 4,031,116 euros and 4,041,382 euros. The unit price of each Fixed 
Income Security IO shall be equal to the result of dividing the subscription of the 
Security IO set on the date the Fund is set up by the number of Fixed-Income 
Securities IO and shall, therefore, be between 1,178 and 1,181 euros. The total 
subscription price of the Security IO, and the unit price of each Fixed-Income Security 
IO, shall be set on the date the Fund is set up and shall be notified to the CNMV, 
before the Subscription Period begins, as additional information to be included in the 
Prospectus. 
 
The subscription price of the Security IO shall be for the Managing Company to be 
used for the partial appropriation to the Reseve Fund. 
 
The Security IO shall mature on 21 June 2008, or on the date all the Bonds in Tranche 
A are redeemed, if said latter date is earlier. 
 
Each Fixed-Income Security IO shall entitle its holder to exclusive rights to 
collect, on every Payment Date until its respective maturity, an amount 
equal to 0.75% per annum (for the first five Payment Dates the percentage 
payable shall be 2.5% per annum instead of 0.75% per annum) of the 
reference amount for each Fixed Income Security IO (the "Payment IO"). The 
Payment IO shall be governed by the same rules as apply to the interest on the Bonds 
in Tranche A as regards the Payment Priority Order.  
 
The reference amount for the Fixed-Income Securities IO shall be equal, at any 
moment in time, to the result of dividing the Reference Amount of the Security IO by 
the number of Fixed-Income Securities IO. For the purposes hereof, the "Reference 
Amount of the Security IO" shall be equal to the lower of the following amounts: 
 
 
(a)25% of the total initial amount of the Bonds in Tranche A; and 
 
(b)the Balance of Principal Outstanding of the Bonds in Tranche A. 
 
The Payment IO does not imply any breakdown whatsoever of principal and interest. 
The financial flows of the Payment IO are directly linked via the amount of its 
reference amount to the redemption of the Bonds in Tranche A and the maturity date 
of the Security IO. 
 
The Managing Company shall apply for the Fixed-Income Securities IO to be traded 
on the AIAF market separately, under the same terms as for all the other Securities 
issued by the Fund. 
 
36 


 
 
 
On each Payment Date, the Managing Company shall calculate the Payment IO and 
order it to be credited to the holders of the Fixed-Income Securities IO through the 
Financial Agent. 
 
II.11 
Redemption of the Securities 
 
II.11.1 Redemption price, specifying whether there are any premiums, bonuses, 
lots or any other financial advantage. 
 
The redemption price of the Bonds in all the Tranches shall be ONE HUNDRED 
THOUSAND EUROS (€ 100,000) per Bond, equal to 100% of their nominal value, 
payable gradually on each Payment Date, as set out herebelow. For their part, the 
Fixed-Income Securities IO shall not be redeemed either when their mature nor 
during the interest payments. 
 
37 


 
 
 
II.11.2 Simple mention of the order number in the Fund's payment priority of the 
repayments of the principal of the securities issued charged to the Fund, 
and a precise indication of the section and pages of this Prospectus where 
the priority rules set for the Fund's payments are described, and specifically 
those that affect the repayments of the principal of said securities 
 
Redemption payments on the Tranche A Bonds come in 5th place in the application of 
the Funds Available, in accordance with the Payment Priority Order set in section 
V.5.1.B)2 of the Prospectus. 
  
Redemption payments on the Tranche B Bonds come in 6th place in the application of 
the Funds Available, in accordance with the Payment Priority Order set in section 
V.5.1.B)2 of the Prospectus. 
 
 
II.11.3 Redemption methods specifying the dates, place, entities, procedure and 
publicity thereof 
 
II.11.3.1 
Final Redemption 
 
The date of full redemption of the Bonds of all the Tranches is 21 March 2038 or, 
should this not be a Business Day, the first Business Day thereafter, notwithstanding 
that prior to said date the Managing Company, acting as the representative of and for 
the account of the Fund, and in accordance with the terms of section II.11.3.3 hereof, 
may proceed to redeem the issue early, in which case the Payment Date on which this 
is set to take place shall be the date on which the Bonds are fully redeemed. 
 
 II.11.3.2 
Partial Redemption 
  
 The above notwithstanding, the Fund, through the Managing Company, shall proceed 
to carry out partial redemptions of the Bonds of all the Tranches in accordance with 
the terms set out herebelow. 
  
 The redemption payment dates of the Bonds in all the Tranches shall be the same as 
the Payment Dates (i.e., 21 March, June, September and December of every year or, 
wherever appropriate, the next Business Day thereafter), as set out in section II.10.3 
hereabove, until they have been fully redeemed. 
 
1. 
Calculation Dates and Calculation Periods 
 
The “Calculation Dates” shall be the dates corresponding to each of the Payment 
Dates on which the Managing Company, representing and for the account of the 
Fund, shall make the calculations needed in order to distribute or withhold the 
Available Funds existing on those dates, in accordance with the payment priority order 
set in section V.5.1.B)2 hereof. 
38 


 
 
 
 
The Calculation Dates shall be the dates corresponding to the fifth (5th) Business Day 
prior to each Payment Date and shall define the period that successively run between 
said Calculation Dates, which shall be called "Calculation Periods". Each Calculation 
Period shall include the initial Calculation Date and exclude the final Calculation Date. 
 
As an exception, the first Calculation Period shall be the period as from and including 
the formation date of the Fund up to but not including the first Calculation Date. 
 
2. 
Balance Outstanding of the Principal of the Bonds 
 
The “Balance of Principal Outstanding” shall be the balance outstanding on the 
Bonds (i.e. the amount of principal of the Bonds that is unredeemed at that moment 
in time). 
 
3. 
Balance Outstanding of the Assets 
 
The “Outstanding Balance of the Assets” shall be the sum of the capital pending 
maturity and the capital matured yet to be paid into the Fund on each of the 
Mortgage Securities and on each of the Mortgage Transfer Certificates. 
 
4. 
Amount of Principal Accrued for Redemption on each Payment Date 
 
The "Amount of Principal Accrued for Redemption" shall be equal, as at the 
Calculation Date preceding each Payment Date, the positive difference, if any, 
between: 
 
(i) 
the Balance of Principal Outstanding on the Bonds on the previous Payment 
Date; and   
 
(ii) 
the Balance Outstanding of the Assets after deducting the BAd Loans on the 
current Calculation Date. 
 
Bad Loans” shall be defined as being those for which: 
 
(a) 
the corresponding Debtor has been declared bankrupt, or 
  
(b) 
there are amounts owed and not paid on their due dates by the corresponding 
Debtor and the Managing Company deems, on the basis of the information 
provided by the Administrators, that such amounts cannot reasonably be 
expected to be recovered; or, in any case,  
 
(c) 
there are amounts owed and not paid on their due dates by the corresponding 
Debtor that remain unpaid for a period of eighteen (18) months. 
39 


 
 
 
 
In the event that an Asset is deemed to have become a Bad Loan, said Asset, 
consisting of its balance outstanding and any accrued interest due but not collected, 
shall be deemed to have expired in its entirety. The Assets shall be reclassified in the 
accounts as memorandum or suspense accounts of the Fund, any action that may 
need to be taken to recover the amounts owed under the Bad Loans, in accordance 
with the terms of the Administration Agreement, notwithstanding. 
 
The Amount Due for Repayment shall be distributed among Tranche A and B in 
accordance with the following rules: 
 
(a) 
The "Amount of Principal Accrued for Redeeming the Tranche A Bonds" 
shall be equal to the lower of the following amounts: 
 
(a) 
any positive difference there may be between i) the total Amount of 
Principal Accrued for Redemption less ii) the Amount of Principal Accrued 
for Redeeming the Tranche B Bonds (calculated in accordance with the 
terms of point (ii) herebelow); and 
 
(b) 
the Balance of Principal Outstanding of the Tranche A Bonds. 
 
(ii) 
La “Amount of Principal Accrued for Redeeming the Tranche B Bonds” 
shall be equal to any positive difference there may be between i) the Balance of 
Principal Outstanding of the Tranche B Bonds less ii) the product of multiplying 
a) double the percentage represented by the initial amount of the Bonds in 
Tranche B in the total initial amount of the Bonds issued by b) the Balance 
Outstanding of the Assets after deducting the Bad Loans on the current 
Calculation Date. 
 
 
 
 
 
The Amount Due for Repayment of the Principal of the Bonds in Tranche B shall 
be zero whenever the amount of the Balance Outstanding of non-performing 
Assets that are more than three (3) months overdue is higher than 1% of the 
Balance Outstanding of the Assets on that same date or the Reserve Fund has 
not been brought up to the required level on the previous Payment Date. 
 
 
For its part, the first Payment Date for redeeming Tranche A Bonds shall be 21 
September 2005, in accordance with the rules laid down in section II.10.3. 
 
40 


 
 
 
5. 
Cash amount payable as redemption on each Payment Date and 
Redemption Deficit 
 
On each Payment Date on which a redemption payment of Bonds is to be made, the 
total amount that is to be used for redemption shall be equal to the amount of the 
Funds Available for Redemption, as described herebelow: 
 
The "Funds Available for Redemption" shall be equal to the lower of the following 
amounts: 
 
(i) 
 the Funds Available existing after the first four (4) items of the Payment 
Priority Order have been paid; and   
 
(ii) 
the Amount of Principal Accruing for Redemption. 
 
The “Redemption Deficit” shall be the positive difference, if there is any, between 
(i) the Amount of Principal Accruing for Redemption and (ii) the Funds Available for 
Redemption after the first four (4) items of the Payment Priority Order have been 
paid; 
 
In the event that on any Payment Date, as a result of the Payment Priority Order, 
there were to be any Amount of Principal Accrued for Redemption of the Bonds in 
any Tranche yet to be repaid: 
 
(i) 
the Funds Available for Redemption shall be used to pay the Balance of the 
Principal Outstanding on the Bonds, in accordance with the rules laid down 
above; 
 
(ii) 
in each Tranche, the Funds Available for Redemption shall be distributed 
proportionally among the Bonds of that Tranche; and 
 
(iii) 
 any amounts that the bondholders fail to receive shall be paid on the following 
Payment Date in so far as this is possible. Said amounts shall not be entitled to 
any additional or late-payment interest whatsoever, (as they shall become part 
of the Balance of the Principal Outstanding on the Bonds of the same Tranche 
affected used as the basis for calculating the interest in the manner provided 
for in section II.10.3 above). 
 
The Managing Company shall notify the bondholders, in the manner provided for in 
section III.5.3, the amount of the redemption that is to be paid to them, the Balance 
of Principal Outstanding on the Bonds of each Tranche, as well as any Redemption 
Deficit, if there is one. 
 
 
41 


 
 
 
 
II.11.3.3 
Early redemption 
 
Notwithstanding the Fund's obligation, through the Managing Company, to redeem 
the Bonds on the Legal Maturity Date or on each part repayment date, the Managing 
Company, after notifying the CNMV, shall be empowered to liquidate the Fund early 
and, consequently to redeem the entire Bond issue early on a Payment Date:  
 
(a) 
whenever all the Assets are to be sold. This sale may take place only in the 
event that the Outstanding Balance of the Assets were to be lower than ten 
percent (10%) of the initial balance of the Securities and the Certificates. This 
power is subject to the condition that the interests of the holders of the 
Securities are not impaired. For this purpose, the sum corresponding to the 
early redemption of the Mortgage Securities and Certificates, together with all 
the other Funds Available on said Payment Date, must be sufficient to ensure 
that any amounts that may be owed by the Fund to the holders of the 
Securities under any heading (as well as any items that have priority over said 
obligation in the Payment Priority Order) may be paid in full); 
 
(b) 
when, in the opinion of the Managing Company, exceptional circumstances 
arise which make it either impossible or extremely difficult to maintain the 
financial equilibrium of the Fund.  
 
(c) 
when there is a failure to pay that is indicative of a serious, permanent 
imbalance with regard to the securities issued or such a non-payment is 
expected to occur; 
 
(d) 
when, as a result of a change for the worse in the tax rules applying to the 
Fund, it becomes impossible to financially maintain the Company. 
 
The Managing Company shall have the capacity to determine by itself, in a decision 
taken by its governing body on the basis of reasonable business and management 
criteria, should any of the aforementioned circumstances arise. The above powers 
must be deemed notwithstanding any liability which may be incurred by the Managing 
Company as a result of any failure to perform its duties. 
 
Furthermore, under the terms of Article 19 of Royal Decree 926/1998, an event for 
terminating the Fund early and redeeming the Funds early would arise in the event 
that the Managing Company were to be put into liquidation, goes into bankruptcy 
proceedings, or should its authorisation be revoked and the legal period set for 
appointing a new managing company were to expire without any such company being 
appointed, in accordance with the terms of section III.3.1 d) of the Prospectus. 
 
42 


 
 
 
The early redemption of all the Bonds in the cases provided for hereabove shall be 
carried out by paying every bondholder the Balance of the Principal Outstanding on 
the Bonds held by the bondholder on the redemption date plus the accrued interest 
not paid on said Bonds up to the date of early redemption, after deducting, whenever 
appropriate, the tax withholding, amounts which for all legal intents and purposes 
shall be deemed to have accrued, be liquid and payable on said date of early 
redemption. 
 
Likewise, the Bonds shall be redeemed early as a result of the fund being liquidated 
and extinguished in the cases and under the terms set out in section III.8.1 hereof. 
 
The early redemption of the Bonds, should it take place, shall be announced in 
accordance with the terms of section III.5.3. 
 
II.12 
Table of financial servicing of the debt, including interest payments and 
redemption of the principal, for each of the Tranches of Asset Securitisation 
Bonds that are going to be issued charged to the Fund 
 
The financial servicing of the issue shall be handled through the CONFEDERACIÓN 
ESPAÑOLA DE CAJAS DE AHORROS in its capacity as Financial Agent.  The payments 
of interest and redemptions shall be notified to the holders of the Securities in the 
cases and with the number of days' prior notice stipulated for each case in section 
III.5.3.a). 
 
The payments of interest and redemptions shall be made through the Financial Agent 
and based on the data included in the accounting records of the member entities of 
the SYSTEMS COMPANY, which shall be designated to be the entity responsible for 
keeping the accounting records of the Securities. 
 
a) 
Practical case for setting the Nominal Interest Rate 
 
In compliance with the terms of section II.10.3 and in order to make it easier for 
subscribers to understand the system used for setting the Nominal Interest Rate and 
the amount of interest to be paid on each Bond on each Payment Date, set out below 
is an example of how they are calculated.  
 
The calculation has been carried out taking, as an example, the following values: (i) a 
three-(3)-month Euribor rate of 2.133% (which is the same as the three-(3)-month 
Euribor rate set and published on 21 April 2005), (ii) a spread of 0.100% for the 
Tranche A Bonds and 0.600% for the Tranche B Bonds (spreads taken, for the sake of 
the example, from within the cap and floor indicated in section II.10.1 b) hereabove) 
and (iii) a Reference Amount for the Security IO equal to 25% of the initial balance of 
the Bonds in Tranche A (as a result of which the reference amount for each Fixed-
43 


 
 
 
Income Security IO shall be equal to 342,200,000*25%*(1/3,422) = 25,000 euros) 
and annual interest of 0.75% and (iv) an Interest Accrual Period of ninety (90) days.

The Payment IO for a reference amount for the Fixed-Income Security IO equal to 
25,000 euros would be 46.86 euros. 
 
The method used to calculate the amount of interest payable on each Bond on the 
first Payment Date shall be the same as described above for the successive Payment 
Dates, except that the benchmark interest rate to be used for determining the 
Nominal Interest Rate of the Bonds shall be the rate that results from a straight-line 
interpolation between four-(4)-month Euribor and five-(5)-month Euribor, calculated 
using the formula provided in section II.10.1.c) hereabove which is reproduced 
herebelow: 
 
TCa = [(TL – TC) /(DL - DC) * (DCa - DC)] + TC 
 
For the sake of clarity, set out below is an example of the calculation of the 
benchmark rate resulting from the interpolation. For said purpose, the following 
values have been taken as an example: 
 
TL  = five-(5)-month benchmark Euribor rate of 2.151% (which is equal to the five-
(5)-month Euribor rate set and published on 21 April 2005), 
 
TL  = four-(4)-month benchmark Euribor rate of 2.143% (which is equal to the four-
(4)-month Euribor rate set and published on 21 April 2005), 
 
DL  = 150, 
 
DC = 120 and 
 
Dca = an Interest Accrual Period of 145 days (as from and including 29 April 2005 
(Pay-in Date), up to, but not including 21 September 2005 (first Payment 
Date). 
 
Using the formula set out in section II.10.1.c) hereabove, the benchmark interest rate 
for the first Interest Accrual Period would be equal to 2.150%. 
 
After the benchmark rate resulting from the interpolation has been set, the amount of 
interest payable would be calculated as described above for any Interest Accrual 
Period.

b) 
Tables of the financial servicing of the debt 
 
The main feature of asset securitisation bonds is that they are redeemed at regular 
intervals. This means that their average life and duration depends fundamentally on 
the speed at which the Debtors decide to repay their respective Mortgage Loans.  
 
Any early repayments that the Debtors decide to make, subject to constant changes 
and estimated in the Prospectus using several different hypothesis for the behaviour 
of the constant annual effect rate of early repayment or future prepayment, shall have 
a direct effect on the speed of repayment of the Mortgage Loans and on the average 
life and duration of the Bonds. 
 
There are other variables, also subject to constant change, which affect the average 
life and duration of the Bonds. These variables and their hypothetical values assumed 
in all the tables provided in this section are: 
 
(i) 
that the rate of early repayment is kept constant in the scenarios at 0%, 5% 
and 10%, the band in which the Managing Company, on behalf of the Fund, 
has estimated the probable maximum and minimum levels of prepayments; 
 
(ii) 
that the annual percentage of non-performing Securities and Certificates in the 
portfolio of Mortgage Securities and in the portfolio of Mortgage Transfer 
Certificates is; 
 
(iii) 
that the Managing Company shall exercise the clean-up call option provided for 
in section II.11.3.3, paragraph (a.11.3.3;  
 
(iv) 
that the Pay-in Date falls on 29 April 2005 and that the Payment Dates fall on 
21 March, June, September and December every year (assuming that all these 
dates are Business Days, except for the first Payment Date, which shall fall on 
21 September 2005); 
 
(v) 
that the weighted average interest rate of the portfolio of Mortgage Loans is 
3.86% (equal to the weighted average nominal interest rate for the portfolio of 
loans selected for the purposes of the tables below (as at 29 March 2005). 
 
The figures in this section relating to the Bonds in Tranche A have been calculated 
after the segregation of the Security IO. 
 
 
The real, adjusted duration of the Bonds will also depend on their floating interest 
rate, and all the tables in this section assume that the Nominal Rates of Interest of 
the Bonds are:

Tranche A Bonds, and of 0 600% for the Tranche B Bonds.

Tranche A Bonds, and of 0 600% for the Tranche B Bonds. 
.
 
For its part, on each Payment Date, the Payment IO shall be equal to 0.75% per 
annum of the reference amount for the Fixed-Income Security (except for the first five 
Payment Dates, when said percentage shall be 2.5% per annum). 
 
Assuming the above values and hypotheses, the average life, duration and maturity of 
the Bonds in each Tranche, respectively, in each of the early repayment scenarios 
envisaged would be as follows:

day (365) periods, that elapses between the Pay-in Date and the Maturity of 
the Securities.

Finally, the Managing Company states, representing and for the account of the Fund, 
that the tables of the financial servicing of the debt indicated here are only theoretical 
and illustrative and do not represent any payment obligation whatsoever, and repeat 
that: 
 
• The Rates of Early Repayment of the Assets are assumed to remain constant at 
0%, 5% and 10% respectively, over the life of the debt, and real early repayment 
changes all the time. 
 
49 


 
 
 
• The Balance of Principal Outstanding of the Bonds at each Payment Date and the 
interest payable on each one of them will depend on the real early repayment rate 
in the portfolio of Securities and Certificates. 
 
• The spread applying to each Tranche of Bonds for the purposes of setting the 
Nominal Interest Rate is assumed to be 0.100% for the Tranche A Bonds and 
0.600% for the Tranche B Bonds, although said spreads shall be calculated by the 
Managing Company on the formation date of the Fund, after consulting the Lead 
Managers and the Underwriting Entities and shall be between cap and floor 
indicated in section II.10.1 b) hereabove. 
 
• The Nominal Rates of Interest of the Bonds are assumed to be constant for each 
Tranche, although the interest rate of all the Tranches is floating. 
 
• The subscription price of the Security IO is assumed to be equal to 4,037,960, 
although the final subscription price will not be set until the date the Fund is set 
up. 
 
• It is assumed that the Managing Company, representing and acting for the account 
of the Fund, shall exercise the clean-up call option provided for in section II.11.3.3. 
paragraph one.

Effective interest forecast for the taker, taking into account the 
characteristics of the issue, specifying the method of calculation used and 
the expected expenses for items appropriate to its real nature 
 
II.13.1 Effective interest for the taker 
 
As, at the time this Prospectus was drafted, the spreads applying to each Tranche of 
Bonds for the purposes of setting the Nominal Interest Rate have not yet been set, for 
the calculation of the effective rate of interest for the bondholder, the spreads given 
as an example are 0.100% for the Tranche A Bonds and 0.600% for the Tranche B 
Bonds (these spreads fall within the caps and floors set in section II.10.1.b) 
hereabove). 
 
Thus, were the Nominal Rates of Interest applying to all the Tranches, which vary 
every quarter, to remain constant over the entire life of the debt, at the rates set out 
in the table shown in section II.12.b).2 - except for the first Interest Accrual Period, 
for which the rates resulting from the interpolation as set out in the table shown in 
section II.12.b).1 -, these rates would result in Internal Rates of Return ("I.R.R.") 
subscribers to the Bonds in each Tranche, respectively, as shown in the tables given 
in section II.12.b) (which is reproduced herebelow, as far as the I.R.R. are concerned, 
for each of the early redemption scenarios foreseen) assuming in every case that the 
values and assumptions are as set out in said section II.12.b). For its part, the I.R.R 
for the taker of each Fixed-Income Security IO must take into account the date and 
price of the purchase, as well as the Payment IO. 
 
 
 
II.14 
The effective interest forecast for the Fund at the time the securities are 
issued, taking into account all the design and placement expenses incurred, 
specifying the method of calculation 
 
The Effective Rate of Return has been calculated using the same formula as used for 
calculating the I.R.R. for the subscriber to the Securities issued, adding the formation 
and issue and placement expenses of the Fund to the flow of payments made by the 
Fund to the holders of the Securities.

(*) The Underwriting Fees shall be determined on the date the Fund is set up by the 
Managing Company, after consulting the Lead Managers and the Underwriting 
Entities. The Underwriting Fees that will be charged by each of the Underwriting 
Entities shall be:  
 
 
Between 0.075% and 0.150% of the total nominal amount of the Bonds in 
Tranche A they underwrite;  
 
Between 0.150% and 0.250% of the total nominal amount of the Bonds in 
Tranche B they underwrite. 
 
For the purposes of calculating the estimated amount of the aforementioned 
Underwriting Fee, an example has been taken of an Underwriting Fee of:  
 
 
0.100% of the total nominal amount of the Tranche A Bonds it underwrites;  
 
0.200% of the total nominal amount of the Tranche B Bonds it underwrites. 
 
Underwriting the Fixed-Income Securities IO does not entitle to collect the 
Underwriting Fee.

(**) The part of the Reserve Fund not funded from the subscription price of the 
Security IO shall not be known until said price is et (i.e. until the date the Fund is set 
up) and shall be between 538,618 and 593,884 euros. 
 
The expenses set out in the table above shall be paid charged to the Subordinated 
Loan for Start-Up Expenses described in section V.3.2. 
 
The estimated expenses do not include VAT on those invoices that are subject to, and 
not exempt from VAT. 
 
II.15 
Whether or not there are special guarantees  
 
There are no special guarantees on the Mortgage Securities and Certificates that are 
bundled together in the Fund nor on the Securities that are issued against the assets 
of the Fund, except for the following commitments that the Assignors assume for as 
long as the Assets are in force: 
 
(1) 
Every one of the Assignors undertakes, for as long as the Mortgage Securities 
and Certificates are in force, to replace each and every one of the Mortgage 
Securities and Certificates deriving from any Mortgage Loans that were, on the 
date the Fund is set up, to have hidden defects, or, on the date the Fund is set 
up, were not fit in with the statements set out in section IV.1.a) by other 
securities or certificates, as appropriate, with similar characteristics as regards 
the remaining term, interest rate, value of principal outstanding and credit 
rating in terms of the ratio between the principal outstanding on the security or 
the certificate and the assessed value of the property given as security for the 
underlying mortgage loan, that qualify to be included in an Asset Securitisation 
Fund, in accordance with the terms of section IV.1.d) hereof. Should this prove 
impossible, every one of the Assignors undertakes to redeem the Mortgage 
Securities and Certificates affected, as applicable, early, reimbursing in cash the 
principal outstanding, the accrued interest receivable and any other amount to 
which the Fund may be entitled up to said date, in accordance with the terms 
of said section IV.1.d; 
 
 (2) 
Furthermore, the statement set out in section IV.1.a) notwithstanding, every 
one of the Assignors gives its guarantee that should any of the Debtors hold 
any credit right with regard to it, and were to proceed to exercise said right by 
offsetting said credit against the debt deriving from a Mortgage Loan, it shall 
notify the Managing Company and shall make a payment to the Fund, in the 
account it indicates or which is set up for said purpose, of an amount equal to 
the amount that was offset to which the Fund was entitled. 
 
None of the above guarantees of the Assignors is to be taken as a guarantee of 
payment in the event of non-payment by the Debtors.

II.22 
Personal income tax arising from the securities offered, making a 
distinction between resident and non-resident subscribers 
 
 Set out below is a brief extract of the tax rules applying to the investments deriving 
from the issue, for which purpose only the national legislation currently in force and 
the aspects of a general nature likely to affect the investors has been taken into 
account. Investors should take into account any special tax circumstances that may 
apply to them, such as rules applying on a territorial basis and the rules of current law 
at the time the corresponding income is obtained and declared.  
  
65 


 
 
 
 As all the Securities in the issue are represented by entries in account and an 
application shall be made for it to be traded and listed on a Spanish official secondary 
securities market and as these circumstances are significant when determining 
taxation, it has been assumed that these conditions will be fulfilled. It has also been 
considered that all the Securities, at the time they are issued, shall be deemed to be 
financial claims on explicit yields, whenever this classification is significant for tax 
purposes. 
  
 Any withholdings, payments on account and taxes that have been set up, or will be 
set in the future, on the principal, the interest or the yields of the Securities shall 
charged to the account of the holders of the Securities and the amount thereof shall 
be deducted, whenever appropriate, by the Financial Agent, acting on the instructions 
of the Managing Company in the manner laid down by law. 
  
 During the life of the Securities, the legal rules that govern them shall be as derived 
from the legislation currently in force at the time.  
  
II.22.1 Private individuals or legal entities resident in Spain 
 
a) 
Personal Income Tax 
 
 The yields obtained by any holders of the Securities who are subject to Personal 
Income Tax, on the interest on the Securities and on the transfer, reimbursement or 
redemption of the Bonds, shall be deemed to be income from capital made by 
transferring their own capital to third parties in accordance with the terms of Article 
23.2 of Royal Legislative Decree 3/2004, dated 5 March, which enacts the Amended 
Text of the Personal Income Tax Act. 
 
In the event that the Securities are transferred, reimbursed or redeemed, the 
difference between their transfer, reimbursement or redemption value (less any 
expenses relating to the disposal) and their acquisition or subscription value (plus any 
expenses relating to the acquisition), shall be computed as investment income). The 
Fixed-Income Securities IO shall give rise to a negative return on the subscription 
amount or, as applicable, the cost of acquiring them on the market, as they give no 
entitlement to any repayment. 
 
 
Any investment losses recorded on the transfer of the Securities, whenever the 
taxpayer has acquired any other homogeneous financial assets within two (2) months 
prior to or after said transfers, shall be included in the basis of assessment for the tax 
as and when the homogeneous financial assets that remain part of the taxpayer's 
assets are transferred. 
 
The net investment return shall be determined by deducting the management and 
deposit fees for the Securities from the gross returns, except for those fees that 
66 


 
 
 
represent consideration for an individual, discretionary operation of the investment 
portfolio. The net returns arising on the transfer, reimbursement or redemption of any 
Securities that have been part of the investor's assets for more than two (2) years 
shall be reduced by 40%. 
 
The interest income shall be subject to a 15% withholding for the account of the 
personal income tax of the person receiving the interest, in accordance with the terms 
of Section 103 of Law 3/2004, dated 5 March, which modifies the text of the Personal 
Income Tax Act. There is, on the other hand, no obligation to make withholdings on 
the revenues made on the transfer or reimbursement of financial claims with explicit 
yields which meet the following requirements (as is envisaged in this issue): (i) that 
they are represented by entries in account and (ii) that they are traded on a Spanish 
official secondary securities market. 
 
 The above notwithstanding, the part of the price corresponding to the coupon that 
has accrued when the Securities are transferred during the thirty (30) days 
immediately prior to the maturity date of said coupon shall be subject to withholding 
(at 15%), whenever (i) the acquirer is a person or entity not resident in Spain or is 
liable to Corporation Tax, (ii) the acquirer is subject to no withholding on the explicit 
income deriving from the Securities transferred. 
 
b) 
Corporation Tax 
 
 The income, be it interest income or capital gains made when the Securities are 
transferred, redeemed or reimbursed, earned by entities that are liable to Corporation 
Tax shall be included in the basis of assessment in the manner provided for in Title IV 
of Royal Legislative Decree 4/2004, dated 5 March, which enacts the amended text of 
the Corporation Tax Act. 
 
 In accordance with the current wording of Article 59.q) of Royal Decree 1777/2004, 
dated 30 July, which enacted the Corporation Tax Regulations, income earned by 
taxpayers liable to Corporation Tax on financial assets is subject to no withholding 
requirement, provided that the following requirements are met (as is provided for in 
this issue): (i) that they are represented by entries in account and (ii) that they are 
traded on a Spanish official secondary securities market. 
 
 In this regard, in accordance with the Ministry Order dated 22 December 1999, the 
procedure for effectively qualifying for exemption from the withholding or payment of 
advance tax provided for in Article 59.q) of the Corporation Tax Regulations, for 
interest paid to taxpayers who are liable to Corporation Tax, shall be subject to the 
following requirements: 
 
1.- 
The Managing Company, acting on behalf of and representing the Fund as the 
issuing entity, shall pay in to the depositary entities, via the Financial Agent, the 
67 


 
 
 
net amount resulting from applying the general withholding rate in force on 
that date to all the interest. 
 
2.- 
By day 10 of the next month after the maturity date of each coupon, the 
depositary entities must provide either the Managing Company or the Financial 
Agent with a detailed list of the bondholders who are liable to the Tax, giving 
information as to their identity, the ISIN Code of the securities, the number of 
securities they hold on the maturity date of each coupon, the corresponding 
gross income and amount withheld.  
 
3.- 
The holders of the Securities must accredit this situation with the depositary 
entities by day 3 of the next month after the date the coupon matures, so that 
the depositary entities can draw up the list referred to in the preceding 
paragraph. 
 
4.- 
The Managing Company, as soon as it receives this list, shall immediately pay, 
through the Financial Agent, the depositary entities the excess amount withheld 
from said bondholders who are liable to Corporation Tax. 
 
5.- 
The depositary entities shall immediately pay the amount withheld from the 
taxpayers liable to Corporation Tax. 
 
II.22.2 Private individuals or legal entities not resident in Spain 
 
The yields obtained by holders of the Securities who are subject to Non-resident 
Personal Income Tax, on the interest on the Bonds and on the transfer, 
reimbursement or redemption of the Bonds, shall be deemed to be income earned in 
Spain, with or without a permanent establishment, in accordance with the terms of 
Royal Legislative Decree 5/2004, dated 5 March, which enacted the current text of the 
Non-Resident Income Tax Act. 
 
a) 
Income earned through a permanent establishment 
 
The income earned on the Securities by a permanent establishment in Spain shall be 
taxed in accordance with the Securities rules laid down in Chapter III of said Royal 
Legislative Decree 5/2004. Taxpayers liable to Non-Resident Personal Income Tax 
who receive income from financial assets through a permanent establishment in Spain 
shall be governed by the same rules on withholdings as are laid down for taxpayers 
liable to Corporation Tax. 
 
There is therefore no obligation to make withholdings on the income from financial 
assets that they obtain, provided that, as provided for in this issue, the financial 
assets are represented by entries in account and are traded on an official secondary 
Spanish market. 
68 


 
 
 
 
The procedure for applying the exemption from withholding on earnings from this 
type of financial asset is set out in the Order of the Ministry of the Economy and 
Finance dated 22 December 1999. 
 
b) 
Income earned without going through a permanent establishment 
 
 The yields on the Securities obtained by persons or entities not resident in Spain who 
are acting, for the purposes hereof, without a permanent establishment, shall be 
taxed in accordance with the rules of Chapter IV of said Royal Legislative Decree 
5/2004. Set out below are the most notable of these rules, notwithstanding the terms 
of the Double Taxation Treaties signed by Spain, which may determine that the 
corresponding income is not taxed, or else is taxed at reduced rates: 
 
• 
The basis of assessment shall be calculated as the gross amount of revenue 
earned, in accordance with the rules laid down in Royal Legislative Decree 
3/2004, dated 5 March, which enacts the amended text of the Personal Income 
Tax Act. The reductions provided for in said Royal Legislative Decree shall not 
apply. 
 
• 
In the event of transfer, reimbursement or redemption, the accessory expenses 
of acquisition and disposal shall be taken into account for the calculation, 
provided that they are adequately justified. The taxation shall be separate for 
each total or partial accrual of income subject to taxation. They may not be 
offset against one another. 
 
• 
The Tax shall be calculated by applying a rate of 15% to the above basis of 
assessment, unless a lower rate or an exemption applies under the internal 
regulation or in a Double Taxation Treaty signed by Spain. Whenever, by virtue 
of the investor's place of residence, an internal exemption or a Double Taxation 
Treaty signed by Spain were to apply, the exemption or, as appropriate, the 
reduced rate provided for therein for this type of income shall apply to this type 
of income, provided that a tax residence certificate or equivalent document 
provided for in the applicable treaty or enacting regulation is produced in 
accordance with the terms set out hereabove. 
 
• 
The yield obtained on the Bond issue, be it from collecting on coupons or by 
transferring, redeeming or repaying the Securities, by persons or entities not 
resident in Spain who are acting, for these purpose, without a permanent 
establishment in Spain, shall be exempt whenever the recipient is a resident of 
another Member State of the European Union or when obtained through a 
permanent establishment of a resident in a Member State located in another 
Member State, provided that an appropriate certificate of residence or 
equivalent document provided for in the applicable treaty or enacting 
69 


 
 
 
regulation, issued by the tax authorities of the country where the investor 
resides, is produced. 
 
• 
The income derived from the transfer of said securities in Spanish official 
secondary securities markets, obtained by non-resident private individuals or 
entities, without going through a permanent establishment in Spanish territory, 
who are residents of a State that has signed a Double Taxation Treaty with 
Spain containing an information exchange clause shall also be exempt. For said 
purpose, the appropriate tax residence certificate, issued by the tax authorities 
of the country where the investor is resident, must be produced. 
 
• 
Under no circumstances shall the exemptions described in the preceding 
paragraphs apply, when the income is obtained through countries or territories 
classified in the regulations as tax havens. 
 
 The income obtained by non-resident holders of the Securities may be subject to 
withholding on account of Non-Resident Income Tax, in accordance with the following 
rules: 
 
• 
Payment of interest on the Securities shall be subject to a withholding on 
account of Non-Resident Income Tax, except in cases where proof is provided 
that the Tax has been paid or the Bondholder qualifies for exemption. 
 
• 
The amount of the withhold shall, as a general rule, be equal to the tax payable 
under the aforementioned criteria, the general rate for the withholding being 
15%. 
 
• 
However, there is no withholding obligation on income on the transfer or 
reimbursement of the financial assets that are the object of this issue, as they 
are represented by entries in account and are traded on an official secondary 
Spanish market, except for the part of the price which represents the accrued 
coupon in transfers made within thirty days immediately before the coupon falls 
due whenever (i) the acquiror is a person or entity not resident in Spain, or is 
subject to Corporation Tax, and (ii) the acquiror is exempted from making 
withholdings on said income. This, notwithstanding any several liability that 
might be incurred by the deposit or managing entity and any filing obligations 
and the eventual payment of the tax by the non-resident holder itself. 
 
• 
In cases where financial institutions domiciled, resident or represented in Spain 
which are depositories or manage the collection of the income on the Securities 
are involved in the procedure for paying interest, the procedure for making the 
withholding effective, at the rate applying in each case, or the exemption from 
withholding, shall be as set out by the Ministry of Economy and Finance in the 
Order dated 13 April 2000, which is described herebelow: 
70 


 
 
 
 
1. 
The Managing Company, representing and for the account of the Fund, 
shall transfer to the depository entities, either directly or through the 
Financial Agent, on every interest due date, the net amount resulting for 
applying the general withholding rate in force on said date to all the 
interest. 
 
2. 
The depository entities must submit to either the Financial Agent or the 
Managing Company, by day 10 of the next month after the month the 
coupon matures, a detailed list of holders of the Securities who are not 
resident in Spain and have no permanent establishment in Spain, stating, 
inter alia, the identity and place of residence of the holder of the 
Securities, the number of securities held by the holder of the Securities 
on the date the coupon matures, the corresponding gross income and 
the withholding to be made. 
 
3. 
The non-resident holders of the Securities must in turn have provided 
proof to the depository entities of their tax residence by producing a 
residence certificate issued by the tax authorities of their country of 
residence, which must expressly state, whenever the withholding is 
exempted or made at a reduced rate under the terms of a Treaty, that 
the investor is a resident in the sense defined by said Treaty, and taking 
into account, furthermore, that said certificate is valid for (1) year as 
from when it is issued. However, whenever the withholding is made 
applying a limit of taxation set in a Treaty developed by an Order which 
stipulates that a specific formula be used, it shall be justified therein 
instead of the certificate. 
 
4. 
The Managing Company, representing and acting for the account of the 
Fund, as soon as it receives the list referred to in the previous paragraph, 
shall immediately transfer to the depository entities, either directly or 
through the Financial Agent, the amount withheld from the investors who 
qualify for exemption from the withholding, or the amount withheld over 
and above the limits of taxation set in the Treaty applying to the 
investors who are entitled to reductions. 
 
5. 
The depository entities shall, in turn, immediately pay, for the account of 
the Managing Company, acting as the representative and for the account 
of the Fund, the amount withheld or the excess withheld, as applicable, 
from the non-resident investors. 
 
In the event that they are unable to provide proof, for these purposes, of their 
tax residence status, the income received on the Securities , be it interest 
income or when transferring, reimbursing or redeeming the bonds, by non-
71 


 
 
 
resident Bondholders shall be subject to taxation under the general rules 
described above, although they may apply for any excess withholding or 
taxation to be refunded by going through the formalities and using the 
standard return provided for this purpose under the terms of the Ministerial 
Order dated 23 December 2003. 
 
II.22.3 Indirect taxation of the Securities 
 
Issues, acquisitions, subscriptions and transfers of securities are exempt from Transfer 
Tax and Stamp Duty and from Value Added Tax. 
 
II.22.4 Wealth Tax 
 
Private individuals subject to taxation on all their personal income worldwide who are 
required to file a return for this Tax and who hold Securities on 31 December each 
year, must include them in their Wealth Tax Return where they shall pay tax in 
accordance with the general rules. For these purposes, the Securities shall be 
computed at the average traded value for the fourth (4th) quarter of each year 
published for said purpose by the Ministry of Finance every year. 
 
Non-resident private individuals who hold Securities on 31 December each year shall 
be subject to taxation on all their income obtained in Spain, shall also be subject to 
Wealth Tax, unless otherwise provided for in the Double Taxation Treaties. This 
notwithstanding, residents of other member states of the European Union shall be 
exempt with regard to Securities with yields that are exempted from Non-Resident 
Income Tax, in accordance with the terms set out hereabove. 
 
II.22.5 Inheritance and Gift Tax 
 
Mortis causa transfers of Securities or donations to private individuals are governed by 
the general rules for Inheritance and Gift Tax, the provisions of the Double Taxation 
Treaties signed by Spain notwithstanding. In cases where the beneficiary is a 
Company, the revenue obtained shall be taxed in accordance with the rules on 
Corporation Tax or Non-Resident Income Tax, depending on the case, in this latter 
case the provisions of the Double Taxation Treaties notwithstanding. 
 
II.23 
Aim of the operation 
 
The entire net amount of the Securities issue shall be used to pay the price of 
subscribing to the Mortgage Securities and Certificates issued by the Assignors which 
shall be bundled together in the assets of the Fund.  
 
For its part, the net amount of the issue of the Security IO shall be used entirely for 
funding the Reserve Fund.

The Assignors, if they deem appropriate, may acquire Securities in this issue in their 
own name.

replacement. 
 
The Managing Company may not resign from its position, and must remain in its post,

managing company of the Fund.  
 
The expenses involved in making the replacement shall be charged to the Managing 
Company and under no circumstances may they be imputed to the Fund. 
 
The replacement must be published, within fifteen (15) days, as an announcement in 
two national daily newspapers and in the AIAF gazette. The Managing Company must

that no new managing company had been found, the Fund shall be liquidated early in 
accordance with the terms of the Formation Deed and of this Prospectus. 
 
85 


 
 
 
III.3.2 Outline of remuneration paid to the Management Company for performing 
its duties 
 
The Managing Company, in accordance with Royal Decree 926/1998, shall set up, 
represent and administer the Fund. In return for performing these duties, the Fund 
shall pay the Managing Company an Administration Fee consisting of (i) an Up-Front 
Fee and (ii) a Regular Annual Fee (jointly, the "Management Company Fees”). 
 
The Formation Deed shall determine that the Managing Company shall be 
entitled to an Up-Front Administration Fee payable on the Pay-in Date on a 
one-off basis, which shall be equal to the difference between the expenses 
indicated in section II.14, less the amounts invoiced by outside agents for 
services for the formation of the Fund. It is estimated that said Up-Front Fee shall 
be equal to approximately 0.03% of the Outstanding Balance of the Assets on the 
date the Fund is set up. 
 
The Up-Front Fee shall be paid charged to the Subordinate Loan for Start-Up 
Expenses. 
 
The Formation Deed shall also determine that the Managing Company shall be entitled 
to receive a Regular Annual Fee, which shall accrue quarterly as from, and including, 
the preceding Payment Date up to, but not including, the current Payment Date 
(except for the first period, which shall run as from, and including the date the Fund is 
set up, up to, but not including, the first Payment Date), equal to 0.025% a year of 
the sum of the Balances Outstanding on the Assets on the preceding Calculation Date, 
with a minimum annual fee of 30,050 euros, payable on each Payment Date. 
 
The Regular Annual Fee paid on any particular Payment Date shall be 
calculated using the following formula: 
 
365
100
0.025
,
d
B
C
× 
× 
= 
 
where: 
 
C = 
Fee payable on a particular Payment Date. 
B = 
Sum of the Balance Outstanding on the Mortgage Securities and 
Certificates on the preceding Calculation Date. 
d = 
Number of days elapsed during the corresponding accrual period. 
 
The Regular Annual Fee shall be calculated on the basis of: (i) the effective days in 
each period the fee accrues and (ii) a three-hundred-and-sixty-five (365) day year 
(Current/365). 
 
86 


 
 
 
In the event that during the effective period of the Fund the General Retail Price 
Index published by the National Institute of Statistics for each calendar year were to 
increase, the amount of the minimum Regular Annual Fee (30,050 euros) shall be 
adjusted up in the same proportion (being adjusted up in line with the change in the 
General Retail Price Index for the previous year), as from and including 30,050 and 
with effect as from 2006 January every year. 
 
In the event that, on a Payment Date, the Funds were not to have sufficient cash 
reserves to pay the Regular Annual Fee, interest shall accrue on the amount owed at 
the same rate as for Tranche B Bonds in the Interest Accrual Period, and shall be paid 
on the following Payment Date, in accordance with the payment priority order 
provided for in section V.5.1.B)2 of the Prospectus. 
 
In the event that AHORRO Y TITULIZACIÓN, S.G.F.T., S.A. is replaced by another 
securitisation fund managing company as the Managing Company of the Fund, the 
Regular Annual Administration Fee that shall be paid to the new Managing Company 
shall be determined when the replacement takes place, on the basis of a reasonable 
market price. 
 
III.4 
Equity value of the Fund and brief indication of the assets and liabilities 
that determine said value at its origin and after it has begun operating 
 
The Fund is a separate set of assets. It is not a separate legal entity in its own right 
and shall be a closed fund, in accordance with Article 3 of Royal Decree 926/1998. Its 
assets shall consist essentially of the Mortgage Securities and Certificates, the Reserve 
Fund and the unamortised formation expenses, and its liabilities shall consist of the 
Bonds, the Security IO and the Subordinate Loan for Start-Up Expenses (said 
subordinate loan is described in section V.3.2 of the Prospectus), as a result of which 
the net equity value of the Fund is zero. 
 
A description, the characteristics and the price of the issue of the Mortgage Securities

b) 
Number and amount of the Securities and Certificates bundled 
together in the Fund

THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION EUROS (€ 370,000,000). 
 
The issue price of the Mortgage Securities and Certificates shall be at par. 
Accordingly, the price to be paid by the Fund for subscribing to the Mortgage 
Securities and Certificates shall be equal to the sum of the nominal value of 
each Security and Certificate.  
 
Furthermore, as payment of the subscription price of the Assets to the 
Assignors is to be deferred until the Pay-in Date, the Assignors shall be entitled 
to receive interest at three-(3)-month Euribor as a hypothesis when drawing up 
the financial service tables (2.133%). Said interest, which shall be calculated on 
the basis of the number of days that have elapsed between the date the Fund 
is set up and the Pay-in Date and a three-hundred-and-sixty-five-day (365) 
year, shall be settled and paid by the Managing Company, in its capacity as the

Subordinate Loan for Start-Up Expenses. 
 
The price for subscribing to the Assets shall be paid on the Pay-in Date of the

112 
the deferral of the payment of the price for subscribing to the Assets until the 
Pay-in Date.  
 
The ordinary interest accruing on the Mortgage Loans over the period between 
the latest interest-payment date of each Mortgage Loan and the date the Fund 
is set up (the "Accrued Interest"), shall not be transferred by the issue of the 
Mortgage Securities and Certificates (but shall instead continue to be payable to 
the Assignors), which shall be credited by the Fund to the Assignors, as 
appropriate, as and when they are received, and may be offset by the 
Assignors themselves (in the case of CAJA GENERAL DE AHORROS DE 
GRANADA, by directly debiting the corresponding Charge Account GRANADA; 
and, in the case of UNIÓN DE CRÉDITO PARA LA FINANCIACIÓN MOBILIARIA E 
INMOBILIARIA, CREDIFIMO, E.F.C. S.A., by direct debit in an accounting entry 
in the Charge Account CREDIFIMO). 
 
Any collections and payments between the Assignors and the Managing 
Company, for the account of the Fund shall be made: 
 
(i) 
if they are owed to the Assignors, into the account specified by each one 
of them at any time (except for any Interest Accrued prior to the date 
the Mortgage Securities and Certificates are issued which may be debited 
directly by the Assignors in the accounts they each indicate); and 
 
(ii) 
if they are owed by the Assignors, into the Cash Account. 
 
In the event that the formation of the Fund and the issue and subscription of 
the Mortgage Securities and the Mortgage Transfer Certificates be terminated 
as a result of the Rating Agency not confirming as final the provisional ratings 
assigned to the Securities by the beginning of the Subscription Period, the 
obligation to pay the Assignors the price of subscribing to the Assets and any 
interest accruing as a result of deferring said payment shall be extinguished.  
 
c) 
Description of the rights that the Mortgage Securities and Certificates 
entitle the holders of title thereto with regard to the Mortgage Loans 
that back them 
 
The Mortgage Securities and Certificates refer to a 100% holding in the 
principal and the ordinary and late-payment interest of each Mortgage Loan. 
 
The Assignors, in accordance with Section 5.8 of Law 19/1992, by remission of 
Article 1.2 of Royal Decree 926/1998, in accordance with additional provision 
five, section two of Law 3/1994, do not bear the risk of any non-payment of the 
Securities or the Certificates and, therefore, are not in any way liable for any 
failure on the part of the Debtors to pay the principal, the interest or any other 
amount that they may owe by virtue of the Mortgage Loans. The holding in the 
Mortgage Loans shall be made for the term remaining until said Loans expire. 
Neither shall they assume any liability whatsoever for guaranteeing directly or 


 
 
 
113 
indirectly the success of the operation, nor shall they give any guarantees, nor 
shall they enter into any agreements to repurchase the Securities or the 
Certificates, accept as provided for in section IV.1.d) herebelow. 
 
The Mortgage Securities and Certificates shall, as from the date they are 
subscribed to by the Fund (which shall be the same as the Formation Date of 
the Fund) entitle their holders to the following rights with regard to the 
Mortgage Loans: 
 
a) 
to be paid all the amounts accruing from repayments of the principal of 
the Mortgage Loans; 
 
b) 
to be paid all the amounts accruing in ordinary interest on the Mortgage 
Loans; 
 
c) 
to be paid all the amounts accrued in late-payment interest on the 
Mortgage Loans; 
 
d) 
to receive any other amounts, assets or rights as payment of the 
principal, interest or expenses of the Mortgage Loans, be it the auctioned 
price or amount set by court order or by notarial proceedings when 
foreclosing on the mortgage securities, for disposing of or operating the 
building adjudicated or as a result of said foreclosures, during the interim 
administration and possession of the properties during the foreclosure 
proceedings; 
 
e) 
any rights or indemnities to which the Assignors may possibly be entitled 
to, including not only those deriving from the insurance contacts attached 
to the Mortgage Loans, which are also assigned by the Assignors to the 
Fund, but also those deriving from any right accessory to the loan. 
 
All the rights mentioned shall accrue to the Fund as from the date the 
Formation Deed is executed and the Securities and Certificates are issued. 
 
The rights of the Fund resulting from the Mortgage Securities and Certificates 
are linked to the payments made by the Debtors on the Mortgage Loans and, 
accordingly, shall be directly affected by any developments, delays, advances or 
any other incident relating thereto. 
 
Until the Formation Deed is executed, the Assignors shall be the beneficiaries of 
the damage insurance contracts taken out by the Debtors with regard to the 
properties mortgaged as security for the Mortgage Loans. Each of the Mortgage 
Loan deeds shall, in the event that the premium to be paid by the debtor 
(taker) of the insurance is not paid, authorise the Assignors to pay the amount 
of the premium for the account of the Debtor, so that the premiums are always 
paid. By means of the Formation Deed of the Fund, the Assignors shall 
formalise the assignment linked to the issue of the Mortgage Securities and 


 
 
 
114 
Certificates of the rights to which they are entitled as beneficiaries of said 
insurance damage contracts taken out by the Debtors or any other insurance 
policy that provides the same cover. The Fund, as the holder of the Mortgage 
Securities and Certificates, shall therefore be entitled to receive any amounts 
which the Assignors would have been entitled to receive under this heading. 
 
The payments made to the Fund of interest on the Mortgage Securities and 
Certificates shall be subject to no withholding, as provided for in Article 59.k) of 
Royal Decree 1777/2004, date 30 July, which enacts the Corporation Tax 
Regulations. 
 
d) 
Rules governing the replacement of the Mortgage Securities and 
Certificates  
 
In the event that the Securities or the Certificates are redeemed early as a 
result of early repayment of the principal of the Mortgage Loans, the Securities 
or the Certificates affected shall not be replaced. 
 
In the event that, during the term of the Mortgage Securities and Certificates, it 
were to be detected that any of them fails to comply, on the formation date of 
the Fund, with the terms and characteristics set out in section IV.1.a) hereof, 
because the corresponding Mortgage Loan fails to do so, every one of the 
Assignors undertakes, after getting the agreement of the Managing Company, 
to replace or otherwise to redeem early the Security or the Certificate affected, 
subject to the following rules: 
 
1. 
The replacement of the Securities or Certificates affected, which shall, in 
any case, be made at their nominal value plus the accrued interest 
receivable, shall be carried out by issuing the same number of further 
mortgage securities or mortgage transfer certificates, as appropriate, 
suitable for integration in a mortgage securitisation fund, on mortgage 
loans from its portfolio that have characteristics that are of the same 
nature as the Mortgage Loans that underlie the Securities or Certificates 
that are being replaced, in terms of the amount, term (bearing in mind 
that the mortgage loan underlying the new security or the new certificate 
may not, under any circumstances, expire later than the maturity date of 
the Mortgage Loan with the latest maturity date in the Fund on the date 
it is set up), interest rate, characteristics of the Debtor or characteristics 
of the property mortgaged, as well as the credit rating in terms of the 
ratio of the balance outstanding on the mortgage security or the 
mortgage transfer certificate and the assessed value of the property that 
is the security for the underlying mortgage loan. In any case, the 
securitised mortgage loan that underlies the mortgage security or the 
new mortgage transfer certificate, as appropriate, must be up-to-date 
with its payments. 
 
2. 
The replacement shall be carried out as follows: 


 
 
 
115 
 
2.1 
The Assignor of the Security or Certificate that is not suitable shall 
notify the Managing Company that this is the case. The Managing 
Company shall give its prior approval for the replacement. 
Alternatively, in the event that this fact be detected by the 
Managing Company, representing the Fund, it shall inform the 
Assignor affected, so that it may take action in accordance with 
what is indicated herebelow. The Assignor affected shall cancel 
said unsuitable Security or Certificate forthwith by stamping the 
certificate, duly broken down, accordingly, and shall issue another 
Security or Certificate, as appropriate, with similar characteristics 
as regards the remaining term, interest rate, value of principal 
outstanding and credit rating in terms of the ratio between the 
principal outstanding on the mortgage security or the mortgage 
transfer certificate, as appropriate, and the assessed value of the 
property given as security for the underlying securitised mortgage 
loan, after a check has been made by an outside auditing firm, 
prior to the replacement, to ensure that the replacement loan is 
suitable, in accordance with the terms of section I.3, so that the 
Fund's financial structure is not affected by the replacement. The 
Assignor affected must in any case declare that the replacement 
Mortgage Security or the replacement Mortgage Transfer 
Certificate complies with the terms set out in section IV.1.a). 
 
2.2 
The issue of the replacement mortgage security or the 
replacement mortgage transfer certificate by the corresponding 
Assignor and the replacement by the Managing Company, acting 
as the representative of and for the account of the Fund, shall be 
made by executing a notarial deed recording the information 
concerning the Security or the Certificate that is to be replaced and 
the Mortgage Loan underlying it and the new mortgage security or 
mortgage transfer certificate being issued, as appropriate, with 
information about the securitised mortgage loan underlying the 
new security or certificate, as well as the reason for making the 
replacement 
and 
the 
variables 
that 
determine 
that 
the 
characteristics of the two securities or certificates are the same, as 
described hereabove. Said deed must be executed within thirty 
(30) calendar days after the notice referred to in section 2.1 above 
is made. A copy of the deed shall be sent to the CNMV, to the 
SYSTEMS COMPANY and to AIAF and the Rating Agency shall be 
notified. 
 
In the event that, five (5) calendar days after the notification referred to 
in section 2.1 hereabove has been made, no mortgage loans were to be 
found in the Assignors' portfolio with characteristics similar to the 
Mortgage Loan that underlies the Securities or the Certificates being 
replaced, the Assignors shall proceed to redeem the Securities or the 


 
 
 
116 
Certificates affected early, reimbursing in cash the principal outstanding, 
the accrued interest receivable and any other amount to which the Fund 
may be entitled up to said date by virtue of the corresponding Security or 
Certificate. 
 
e) 
Other conditions laid down when issuing the Securities and 
Certificates and when they are subscribed by the Fund and the rules 
laid down, as appropriate, for transferring the Assets 
 
The Managing Company, acting as the representative of and for the account of 
the Fund, shall fully subscribe to the Mortgage Securities and the Mortgage 
Transfer Certificates issued by the Assignors at the same time as the Fund is 
set up and the Formation Deed is executed. The total price that the Fund, 
acting through the Managing Company, must pay for subscribing to the 
Securities and the Certificates shall be the nominal value of the Securities and 
Certificates that are effectively issued. The price that the Fund shall pay the 
Assignors shall be paid on the Pay-In Date (together with the interest on the 
deferral of payment of the price of subscribing to the Assets). 
 
The Mortgage Securities, the Certificates and the Securities that are to be 
issued shall be described in the Formation Deed.  
 
The Mortgage Securities and Certificates shall be transferable by means of a 
written declaration on the certificate itself and, in general, using any of the 
methods allowed by Law. The transfer of the Security or Certificate and the 
address of the new holder must be notified by the acquirer to the Assignor that 
issues the security.  
 
Only institutional or professional investors shall be entitled to hold the Mortgage 
Securities and Certificates. They may not be acquired by non-specialist 
members of the public. Consequently, in accordance with the terms of Article 
64.1 of Royal Decree 685/1982, dated 17 March, as worded by Royal Decree 
1289/1991, dated 2 August, the issue of the Mortgage Securities and 
Certificates shall not be the object of a marginal note to the entry of each of 
the mortgages corresponding to each of the Mortgage Loans in the Property 
Register. 
 
The transferor shall not be held liable for the solvency of the Assignors nor for 
the solvency of the debtor of the Mortgage Loan, nor for the sufficiency of the 
mortgage that secures said Loan. 
 
The Assignors, in accordance with the terms of Article 67 of Royal Decree 
685/1982, shall keep a special book where they shall enter the Securities and 
Certificates issued on each Mortgage Loan, as well as any transfers of said 
Securities and Certificates that are notified to them. The rules governing 
registered securities laid down in Article 67 of said Royal Decree 685/1982 shall 
apply to the Mortgage Securities and Certificates. Any changes of address that 


 
 
 
117 
have been notified by the holders of the Mortgage Securities and Certificates 
shall also be entered in the same book. 
 
Said book shall also record the following information: 
 
a) 
Date the Mortgage Loan is granted and date it expires, the initial amount 
of the Loan and repayment method. 
 
b) 
Information about the mortgage recorded in the register. 
 
f) 
Representation of the Securities and Certificates and deposit 
institutions or entities responsible for keeping the accounting records 
if they are entered in account 
 
All of the Securities, on the one hand, and the Certificates, on the other, issued 
by an Assignor, shall be represented respectively by a multiple certificate. Every 
one of the multiple certificates shall contain the minimum mentions that are set 
out in Article 685 of Royal Decree 1982/17, dated 1289 March, as modified by 
Royal Decree 1991/2, dated 2 August, for mortgage securities, together with 
the registration data of the properties mortgaged as security for the Mortgage 
Loans, the assignment of which they are instrumenting. 
 
In the case that any of the Mortgage Securities or any of the Mortgage Transfer 
Certificates are to be replaced in accordance with the terms of section IV.1.d) 
or, in the event that the Fund is liquidated early, in the cases and subject to the 
terms of section III.8.1, Securities or Certificates, as the case may be, 
represented in a single certificate may be sold to different entities, and in any 
other case that so requires, the Assignors undertake to divide up any multiple 
certificate that represents Securities or Certificates, as the case may be, into as 
many individual or multiple certificates as may be needed and to either replace 
them or exchange them in order to achieve the aforementioned aims.  
 
The multiple certificates shall be deposited with the Financial Agent. The 
relations between the Fund and the Financial Agent are governed by the 
Financial Services Agreement to be signed by the Financial Agent and the 
Managing Company, acting as the representative of and for the account of the 
Fund. The deposit shall be made for the benefit of the Fund. The Financial 
Agent shall therefore keep the multiple certificates representing the Mortgage 
Securities and of the Mortgage Transfer Certificates deposited in safekeeping in 
accordance with the Managing Company's instructions. 
 
g) 
Outline remuneration of the Assignors for the duties of administration 
and safekeeping of the Mortgage Loans referred to in section IV.2 
herebelow 
 
 
 
Each of the Administrators, in return for administrating and holding in 
safekeeping the Mortgage Loans (or whatever entity may respectively replace it 


 
 
 
118 
in the performance of said duties, should this be appropriate in accordance with 
the terms of the Prospectus), shall be entitled to receive, for the periods ending 
on each Payment Date, a subordinate administration fee (the "Fee for 
Administering the Assets") equal to 0.01% per year of the Outstanding 
Balance of the Assets issued by each Administrator on the preceding Payment 
Date, including VAT if not VAT exempt.  
 
 
The Fee for Administering the Assets shall accrue on the Outstanding Balance of the 
Assets issued by each Administrator on the preceding Payment Date, provided that this is 
allowed in accordance with the Individual Account (or, whenever appropriate the 
Adjusted Individual Account) of said Administrator subject to the terms of the Internal 
Management Agreement. 
 
It is expressly stated that the Fees for Administering the Assets shall be deemed to 
include any ordinary expenses incurred when managing collections and recoveries 
(telephone, correspondence, etc.) of Mortgage Loans. 
 
The Management Fee for the Assets shall be calculated on the basis of: (i) the effective 
days existing in each of the fee's accrual periods (which shall be the same as the Interest 
Accrual Periods of the Securities, except for the first period, which shall run from and 
include the date the Fund is set up until, but not including, the first Payment Date) and 
(ii) a three-hundred-and-sixty-five-day (365) year (Current/365). 
 
In the event that the Fund, through the Managing Director, were to fail to pay the entire 
Fee for Administering the Assets owed on any Payment Date, because there is not 
enough liquidity in accordance with the Payment Priority Order, the amounts not paid 
shall be added with no penalty to the Fee for Administering the Assets that is to be paid 
on the following Payment Date, when it shall be paid. 
 
The Fee for Administering the Assets comes in 12th place in the Payment Priority Order. 
In the event that a Manager is replaced, the Fee earned by the new Manager shall be 
included in position 1 on the Payment Priority Order. 
 
Each of the Assignors shall, likewise, as remuneration or compensation for the financial 
intermediation process gone through, be entitled to receive a subordinated, variable 
amount that shall be settled every quarter on each Payment Date. Said amount shall be 
equal to the positive difference, if any, between the Available Funds of the Fund and any 
amounts that must be paid out under the first twelve (12) items on the Payment Priority 
Order on each Payment Date (the "Financial Intermediation Margin”).  
 
This amount shall not be regarded as either a fee or consideration owed in return for 
supplying an asset or providing a service to the Fund. It shall rather be regarded as 
being remuneration for the financial intermediation process performed by the Assignors 
by issuing the Mortgage Securities and Certificates bundled together in the Fund's assets, 
respectively. 
 
 
The Financial Intermediation Margin shall be paid on each Payment Date only in the 
event that, on said Payment Date, there are sufficient Funds Available after 


 
 
 
meeting the requirements of the Payment Priority Order and in the event that 
the Individual Account (or, whenever appropriate, the Adjusted Individual 
Account) of each Assignor were to record a sufficiently large positive balance. 
Should this not be the case, the Assignors shall not receive the Financial 
Intermediation Margin for said Payment Date.  
 
The Financial Intermediation Margin shall be distributed among the Assignors in 
accordance with the terms of the Internal Management Agreement. 
 
Each of the Administrators shall also, on each Payment Date, be entitled to 
have any exceptional expenses it has incurred refunded, such as expenses 
incurred as a result of foreclosing on mortgages, selling properties, etc., after 
documentary proof of said expenses has been provided in relation with the 
administration of the Mortgage Loans.  
 
Said expenses (which shall constitute an extraordinary expense of the Fund) 
shall be paid whenever the Fund has enough liquidity and in accordance with 
the terms of section V.5.1.B)2. 
 
IV.2 
Brief summary description of the system and ordinary procedures for 
administering and holding the Mortgage Loans in safekeeping, paying 
particular attention to the procedures laid down with regard to late 
payments and non-payments of principal or interest, early repayments, 
foreclosures of mortgages and, whenever applicable, modifying or 
renegotiating the loans 
 
The Assignors, in accordance with Article 61.3 of Royal Decree 685/1982, modified by 
Royal Decree 1289/1991, dated 2 August, undertake to administer and hold the 
Mortgage Loans in safekeeping. The relations between the Assignors and the Fund 
shall be governed by the Mortgage Loan Administration Agreement (the 
"Administration Agreement"), which is to be signed by the Assignors (with regard 
to this Agreement, the "Administrators") and the Managing Company, acting as the 
representative of and for the account of the Fund. 
 
The Administrators shall continue to administer the Mortgage Loans and spend the 
same amount of time and care on said Loans and shall act with the same level of 
expertise, care and diligence when administering the Loans as they would use when 
administering Mortgage Loans for which no mortgage securities or mortgage transfer 
certificates have been issued and, in any case, they shall act with a proper level of 
expertise, care and diligence in their duties of administration provided for in the 
Administration Agreement. 
 
The Administrators shall, in any case, waive the privileges and rights to which they are 
entitled by Law in their capacity as collection managers of the Fund and 
119 


 
 
 
administrators of the Mortgage Loans and, in particular, the privileges and rights 
provided for in Articles 1730 and 1780 of the Civil Code and Article 276 of the Code of 
Commerce. 
 
Set out below is a brief, summary description of the ordinary procedures for 
administrating and holding the Mortgage Loans governed by the Administration 
Agreement in safekeeping (the "Services: 
 
1. 
Term 
 
The Administrators shall provide the Services until such time as, after all the Mortgage 
Loans have been repaid, all the obligations entered into by said Administrators with 
regard to the Securities and Certificates they have issued are extinguished or the 
liquidation of the Fund is completed after the Fund has been extinguished. 
 
In the event that any of the Administrators were to go into bankruptcy proceedings, 
be intervened by the Bank of Spain or be liquidated, the Managing Company may, 
whenever this is legally possible, designate a new administrator for the Mortgage 
Loans corresponding to the Administrator concerned. The new administrator must 
agree to take on the obligations provided for in the Administration Agreement. In 
order to prevent the interests of the Fund and/or the holders of the Securities from 
being impaired, in the event that any Administrator has to be replaced in its role as 
administrator of the Mortgage Loans in the manner provided for in this paragraph, 
said Administrator shall continue to perform its duties until the very moment said 
replacement effectively takes place.  
 
The Administrator(s) replaced, after said replacement has been made, must provide 
the new administrator with the documents and computer records that are needed for 
the new administrator to provide the Services. 
 
The costs arising from said replacement shall be charged to the Administrator being 
replaced. 
 
Any replacement of an Administrator in accordance with the terms of this section shall 
be notified to the CNMV in accordance with the provisions of section III.5.3 hereof.  
 
2. 
Sub-contracting 
 
The Administrators may, with regard to the Mortgage Loans they administer, sub-
contract or delegate to third parties the fulfilment of the duties set out in this section, 
provide that this is allowed by law and (i) the Management Company has given its 
prior consent in writing, acting on behalf of the Fund, (ii) as long as it entails no 
downgrading in the ratings granted to the Securities by the Rating Entity and as long 
as (ii) said sub-contractor or delegate has waived its right to make any claim for 
120 


 
 
 
liability against the Fund. In any case, every one of the Administrators shall be 
ultimately responsible for the proper provision of said Services provided for in the 
Mortgage Market Act, Law 2/1981, dated 23 March and Royal Decree 685/1982, dated 
17 March, modified by Royal Decree 1289/1991, dated 2 August. The sub-contracting 
may not involve any modification in the Fund's Formation Deed nor any increase in 
the cost that the Fund, acting through the Managing Company, has to pay the 
Administrators in return for the Services they provide. The sub-contracting envisaged 
herein must be notified to the Rating Agency and may not entail any downgrading of 
the ratings assigned to the Securities.  
 
The third-party entities to whom the Administrators sub-contract the Services must 
undertake, in the corresponding service agreement, to accept and abide by the terms 
and conditions of the Administration Agreement. 
 
3. 
Obligations of the Administrators 
 
The Administrators undertake: 
 
• 
to assign to the Managing Company, representing and acting for the account of 
the Fund, on the formation date, the rights to which they are entitled as 
beneficiaries of the damage insurance contracts taken out by the Debtors with 
regard to the mortgaged properties, up to the amount insured;  
 
• 
to guarantee to the Fund certain conditions, on the date the Fund is set up, of 
the Mortgage Loans that are set out in the Formation Deed and the Prospectus, 
undertaking to replace any Mortgage Securities or, whenever appropriate, the 
Mortgage Transfer Certificates, that fail on the date the Fund is set up to fit the 
conditions and characteristics described in the Prospectus and the Formation 
Deed and, in the event that on their portfolio there are no loans of similar 
characteristics to the Mortgage Loans underlying the Security or the Certificate, 
whichever is appropriate, to be replaced, to redeem early such Securities or 
Certificates that fail, on the date the Fund is set up, to fit the conditions and 
characteristics described in the Prospectus and the Formation Deed, and to pay 
back, in cash, the principal outstanding plus the accrued interest payable, as 
well as any amount the Fund may be entitled to by virtue thereof;  
 
• 
to indemnify the Fund for any damage, loss or expense it has incurred as a 
result of any failure on the part of any of the Administrators to fulfil its 
obligations to administer and hold the Mortgage Loans in safekeeping; 
 
• 
to take into account the interests of the holders of the Securities in their 
relations with the Debtors and when exercising any discretionary powers 
deriving from the performance of the Services; 
 
121 


 
 
 
• 
to fulfil all the reasonable instructions of the Managing Company, given in 
accordance with the terms of the Formation Deed;  
 
• 
to take whatever action may be needed in order to apply for and keep fully 
valid any permits, approvals, authorisations and consents that may be needed 
or advisable in connection with the performance of their Services; and 
 
• 
to have sufficient equipment and staff to meet all their obligations.  
 
4. 
Liability of the Administrators 
 
The Administrators undertake to administer and hold the Mortgage Loans in 
safekeeping with all due diligence and shall be held liable with regard to the Fund, 
through the Managing Company, for any loss that may arise as a result of their 
negligence. 
 
5. 
Guarantees of the Administrators and duty to collaborate 
 
The Administrators shall indemnify the Fund for any damage loss orexpense incurred 
as a result of any failure on their part to fulfil their safekeeping, administration and 
reporting obligations relating to the Mortgage Loans. 
 
The Administrators shall assume no liability whatsoever for guaranteeing directly or 
indirectly the success of the operation, nor shall they give any guarantees, nor shall 
they enter into any agreements to repurchase the Securities or the Certificates, except 
for those that fail to meet the conditions and characteristics referred to hereabove on 
the date the Fund is set up.  
 
In the event that any real estate properties were to be awarded to the Fund, the 
Administrators shall work together actively to facilitate the disposal of said properties, 
in accordance with the terms of the Formation Deed and the Administration 
Agreement.  
 
6. 
Depositing documents 
 
The Administrators shall act, free of charge, as the depositaries of the deeds whereby 
the Mortgage Loans were formalised and of any other documents that may be 
pertinent, including but not only, insurance policies, computer records and the 
documentation relating to any accessory right. They shall keep such documents 
separate from the documents relating to all their other loans. 
 
The Administrators hereby waive any preferential rights to which they may be entitled 
by law in their capacity as the collection managers of the Fund and the depositaries of 
the Mortgage Loans and, in particular, to the rights provided for in Articles 1730 and 
122 


 
 
 
1780 of the Civil Code (holding in pledge of the chose deposited) and Article 276 of 
the Civil Code (guarantee similar to holding the chose deposited in pledge). 
 
The Managing Company, acting as the representative of and for the account of the 
Fund, may examine, and the Administrators must produce, the original copy of the 
deeds whereby the Mortgage Loans were formalised, as well as all the other pertinent 
documents referred to hereabove, deposited with each Administrator, whenever it 
deems so appropriate, and may ask for a copy of any such documents to be delivered 
to it free of charge within no more than five (5) Business Days. The Administrators 
must proceed in like manner for any information that is requested by the Fund's 
auditors.  
 
7. 
Managing collections 
 
Each Administrator, in its capacity as the collection manager of the Mortgage Loans it 
has assigned to the Fund in the issue of the Mortgage Securities and Certificates, shall 
receive for the account of the Fund any amounts that are paid by the Debtors relating 
to the Mortgage Loans, be they voluntary or compulsory payments, either as ordinary 
repayments of the principal or as interest or any other item due by virtue of the 
Mortgage Loans, including any payments arising under the insurance contracts 
assigned to the Managing Company, acting as the representative of and for the 
account of the Fund, and any other rights that are accessory to the Mortgage Loans.  
 
The amounts referred to in the previous paragraph that are received by CAJA 
GENERAL DE AHORROS DE GRANADA shall be paid into the Fund in the Charge 
Account GRANADA, on the same value date that said amounts are received by CAJA 
GENERAL DE AHORROS DE GRANADA.  
 
For their part, the amounts referred to in paragraph one of this section that are 
received by UNIÓN DE CRÉDITO PARA LA FINANCIACIÓN MOBILIARIA E 
INMOBILIARIA, CREDIFIMO, E.F.C., S.A., shall be recorded by said entity in its 
accounts by making an accounting entry in the Charge Account CREDIFIMO until such 
time as they are to be transferred to the Cash Account in accordance with the terms 
of this section. For the purposes hereof, the term "Charge Account CREDIFIMO" 
(which, together with the Charge Account GRANADA, are referred to herein as the 
"Charge Accounts") is defined as the interest-earning memorandum account, set up 
specially by UNIÓN DE CRÉDITO PARA LA FINANCIACIÓN MOBILIARIA E 
INMOBILIARIA, CREDIFIMO, E.F.C., S.A. for this purpose, where the amounts paid by 
the Debtors in connection with the Assets assigned by this entity shall be credited. 
 
Each Administrator shall also pay the Fund, using the same procedure as laid down 
respectively for each one of them in the two paragraphs hereabove, any amounts it 
may receive from the Debtors as early repayments of any of the Mortgage Loans it 
has granted. 
123 


 
 
 
 
Each Administrator shall transfer the following amounts to the Cash Account on the 
second (2nd) Business Day of every calendar week: in the case of CAJA GENERAL DE 
AHORROS DE GRANADA, the balance of the Charge Account GRANADA on the last 
day of the preceding calendar week; and, in the case of UNIÓN DE CRÉDITO PARA LA 
FINANCIACIÓN MOBILIARIA E INMOBILIARIA, CREDIFIMO, E.F.C., S.A., an amount 
equal to the balance recorded in the Charge Account CREDIFIMO on the last day of 
the preceding calendar week. The Administrators may not offset their obligation to 
make said transfer against any obligation of the Fund with regard to the 
Administrators. 
 
The Fund shall earn interest on each Charge Account at a rate equal to the 
benchmark interest rate for the Bonds in force during the current interest settlement 
period, less thirty-five (35) basis points (0.35%), which shall be calculated on the 
basis of the average daily balance of each on of them during the interest settlement 
period and shall be paid every month (on the last day of every month or, in the event 
that it is not a Business Day, on the next Business Day thereafter). 
 
Said interest shall be calculated based on: (i) the effective days in each interest 
accrual period (each period shall coincide with a complete calendar month, except for 
the first period, which shall begin on the date the Fund is set up and end on the last 
day of the same month, and the last period, which shall begin on the first day of the 
month the Fund is liquidated and end on the date the Fund is liquidated) and (ii) a 
three-hundred-and-sixty (360) day year. 
 
8. 
Setting the interest rate 
 
Each Administrator shall calculate the interest rate on the Mortgage Loans that have 
floating interest rates, in accordance with the terms of the contracts governing said 
Loans, and shall notify the Debtors, in the periods stipulated in said contracts, the 
nominal interest rate that applies to the next period. 
 
Each Administrator shall provide information about the resulting interest rate to any 
Debtors who ask for it, as well as to the Managing Company. 
 
124 


 
 
 
9. 
Advancing Funds 
 
The Administrators shall not, under any circumstances, advance any amount 
whatsoever that they have not first received from the Debtors as principal, interest, 
prepayment or other, deriving from the Mortgage Loans. 
 
10. 
Operations not allowed; cases of extension of mortgage 
 
Under the terms of the Administration Agreement, the Administrators may not 
voluntarily cancel the mortgages relating to the Mortgage Loans for any reason other 
than for paying the Mortgage Loan, waive or compromise with regard thereto, 
condone all or part of the Mortgage Loans, or extend them nor, in general, do 
anything that lowers the rank, legal efficiency or financial value of the mortgage or of 
the Mortgage Loans, notwithstanding that it shall handle the requests of the Debtors 
with the same diligence and procedures as for unsecuritised loans. 
 
The Managing Company may, however, under exceptional circumstances, in order to 
avoid the costs and uncertainties involved in any process to foreclose on a mortgage 
and to maintain the Fund's financial equilibrium, and, in any case, looking out for the 
interests of the holders of the Securities, in its capacity as the manager of other 
parties' business, instruct the Administrators or give them prior authorisation to reach 
an agreement with the Debtor, on the terms and conditions they deem appropriate, 
albeit in accordance with Law 2/1994 regarding the subrogation and modification of 
mortgage loans, as worded after the modification enacted in Royal Decree-Law 
2/2003, dated 25 April, regarding measures of economic reform (subsequently 
processed as a Bill and enacted as the Measures of Economic Reform Act, Law 
36/2003, dated 11 November) to make changes to the terms of the ordinary and late-
payment interest rates, the extension of the term of the Mortgage Loan, or both.  
 
In particular, after being authorised by the Managing Company (which must give 
reasonable grounds if it wishes to refuse such permission), each Administrator may 
arrange renewals of the Mortgage Loans that involve a shortening or lengthening of 
the remaining term of the Mortgage Loan concerned (be it by shortening or 
lengthening the repayment period or by altering the method of repayment) in any 
case subject to the restrictions and conditions laid down in applicable law and in this 
Prospectus and, in particular, the time limit posed by the maturity of the Mortgage 
Securities and Certificates, which may not under any circumstances be later than the 
Final Maturity Date of the Bonds (i.e. the first Payment Date after the last maturity 
date (ordinary or advance) of the Mortgage Loans that are the object of the Mortgage 
Securities and Certificates). 
 
The Administrators may not under any circumstances renegotiate the interest rate on 
their own initiative as a result of a drop in the interest rate applying to a Mortgage 
Loan. 
125 


 
 
 
 
Any different renegotiation signed by the Administrators shall take place solely after 
the Managing Company has given its prior authorisation in writing. The Administrators 
agree to apply to the Managing Company for such permission as soon as they find out 
that a Debtor is applying for a renegotiation. The Managing Company, however, 
grants the Administrators general powers to carry out renegotiations (i) of the interest 
rate of the Mortgage Loans (provided that the terms set out herebelow are met) and 
(ii) of the expiry of the Mortgage Loans (albeit taking into account that the terms of 
no Mortgage Loans may be renegotiated to later than the date of expiry of the 
Mortgage Loan which has the latest maturity date of the Loans in the Fund on the 
date the Fund is set up and taking into account that the amount of the sum of 
principal assigned to the Fund for the Mortgage Loans for which the maturity date is 
extended may not exceed ten percent (10%) of the principal assigned to the Fund for 
all the Mortgage Loans). Furthermore, the Administrators may only agree to such 
renegotiations as long as the interval between the repayment instalments of the 
principal of the Mortgage Loan is maintained or shortened, and the same system of 
repayment is maintained. 
 
The Managing Company, acting as the representative of and for the account of the 
Fund, may, after giving the Administrators reasonable prior notice with due grounds 
relating to maintaining the financial equilibrium of the Fund, at any time while the 
Administration Agreement is in force, cancel, suspend or modify the requirements for 
any powers of renegotiation that have been previously granted to the Administrators. 
In any case, any renegotiation of the interest rate of the Mortgage Loans, regardless 
of whether or not it general powers have been granted for such renegotiation, must 
be entered into and settled bearing the Fund's interests in mind. 
 
In the event of any renegotiation of the Mortgage Loan(s), the corresponding 
Administrator shall report to the Managing Company the terms resulting from each 
renegotiation forthwith. This notification shall be made using the computer file 
provided for updating the terms of the Mortgage Loans. The public deeds and the 
private contracts corresponding to the renewal of the terms of the Mortgage Loans 
shall be held in safekeeping by the Administrator who has signed them, in accordance 
with the terms of section IV.2.6 of the Prospectus. 
 
Under the terms of the Administration Agreement, should any of the Administrators 
arrange to change the interest on any Mortgage Loan and, accordingly, the 
corresponding Security or Certificate, according to the case, each Administrator 
undertakes to pay the Fund, for each Mortgage Loan where the interest has been 
changed, for as long as said change remains in force and, on every collection date of 
the Mortgage Loans (each of said dates being a "Collection Date"), the difference (if 
said difference is negative) between (a) the interest that has accrued on the Mortgage 
Loan since the last Collection Date and (b) any interest that has accrued on the 
126 


 
 
 
Mortgage Loan over the same settlement period applying the same interest rate as 
would have applied had not such change been made. 
 
Under the terms of the Administration Agreement, the Administrators may only 
arrange to modify the interest rate of the floating-rate Mortgage Loans that are the 
object of Mortgage Securities when the average weighted spread for the portfolio of 
Mortgage Loans calculated based on the rate for each Loan on that particular 
Collection Date, is equal to or more than seventy-five (75) basis points (0.75%). 
 
Finally, the Administrators shall not be empowered to proceed to renegotiate the 
benchmark rate used to determine the interest rate applying to the Mortgage Loan 
(except when said renegotiation is at the benchmark rate for the Bonds). 
 
Should any Administer effectively find out that the value of the property mortgaged as 
security for a Mortgage Loan that is the object of the issue of a Mortgage Security has 
fallen to below the percentages allowed by law or the threshold set for this purpose in 
the respective loan agreements (should it be lower), shall inform the Managing 
Company forthwith and, at its request, must, in accordance with Articles 26 and 29 of 
Royal Decree 685/1982, call on the borrower involved to extend the mortgage to 
other assets sufficient to cover the ratio required between the value of the asset and 
the loan secured. 
 
The Debtor, after being called on to make the extension, may opt for returning the 
entire Mortgage Loan or the part thereof that exceeds the amount resulting from 
applying the percentage originally used to determine the amount thereof to the 
current assessment. 
 
In the event that, two (2) months after being called on to do so, the Debtor has failed 
either to extend the cover or to return the part of the corresponding Mortgage Loan 
referred to in the previous paragraph, it shall be deemed that the Debtor has opted to 
return the whole loan, which must be demanded forthwith by the Administrator of 
said Mortgage Loan repaid. After the total amount of the Mortgage Loan has been 
received, the corresponding Administrator shall immediately pay the Managing 
Company, acting as the representative and for the account of the Fund, the 
corresponding part in accordance with the terms set out hereabove. 
 
11. 
Powers of the holder of the Mortgage Securities and Certificates in the 
event of non-performance on the part of the Debtor  
 
Foreclosing on the Debtors 
 
Every Administrator shall use the same diligence and procedures for claiming amounts 
overdue on the Mortgage Loans as for all the other loans on its portfolio and, in 
particular, it shall instigate appropriate foreclosure proceedings whenever, after the 
internal deadlines for action aimed at obtaining satisfactory payment in the interests 
127 


 
 
 
of the Fund have expired, the aim pursued has not bee achieved and it shall, in any 
case, instigate such foreclosure proceedings whenever the Managing Company, after 
analysing the specific circumstances, were to deem, in agreement with the 
Administrator, that such action is appropriate. 
 
In any case, and for the case of the Mortgage Securities and Certificates bundled 
together in the assets of the Fund, the Managing Company, acting on behalf of the 
Fund shall, as its holder, be empowered to exercise the powers provided for in Article 
66 of Royal Decree 685/1982 dated 17 March, as modified by Royal Decree 1289/91, 
dated 2 August: 
 
(a) 
To compel the Administrators to instigate foreclosure proceedings on the 
mortgage; 
 
(b) 
to take part, with the same rights, with the Administrators, in their capacity as 
issuers of the Mortgage Securities and Certificates, in the foreclosure 
proceedings instigated by them against the Debtor, appearing personally for 
said purpose in any foreclosure proceedings that have been instigated by them, 
and to share in the proceedings of the sale by auction in proportion to its 
percentage of the foreclosed loan; 
 
(c)  
should the Administrators fail to instigate the proceedings within sixty (60) 
calendar days after the notarised proceeding calling for the debt to be paid, the 
Managing Company, acting as the representative of and for the account of the 
Fund, shall be legitimately entitled subsidiarily to instigate the foreclosure 
proceedings on the corresponding Mortgage Loan in proportion to its share, for 
the principal and the interest; 
 
(d)  
in the event that the proceedings instigated by an Administrator are brought to 
a halt, the Fund, represented by the Managing Company, in its capacity as 
holder of the corresponding Security or Certificate, may subrogate the 
Administrator's position and continue the foreclosure proceedings without 
having wait for said period to expire. 
 
In the cases provided for in paragraphs (c) and (d), the Managing Company, acting as 
the representative of and for the account of the Fund, may apply to the competent 
Court for the corresponding mortgage foreclosure proceedings to be instigated or 
continued, attaching the original title to the Mortgage Security or, as applicable, the 
Mortgage Transfer Certificate, to its petition, after severance of the notarised 
requirement provided for in paragraph (c) above and the certificate of the register for 
the entry and current existence of the mortgage. 
 
Should this be required by law, and for the purposes of Sections 581.2 and 686.2 of 
the Civil Procedures Act, Law 1/2000, dated 7 January, the Administrators, in the 
128 


 
 
 
Formation Deed, shall grant irrevocable powers of attorney, as wide-ranging and 
complete as required by Law so that the Managing Company, acting on behalf of and 
representing each Administrator, may call on the Debtor of any Mortgage Loan 
through notarial channels to pay its debt. 
 
The Fund, in its capacity as holder of the Mortgage Securities and Certificates, may 
also, acting through the Managing Company, participate, on an equal footing with the 
Administrators in the foreclosure proceedings and may, in accordance with the terms 
of Sections 691 et seq. of the Civil Procedures Act, apply to the mortgage property to 
be adjudicated as payment for its loan. The Managing Company shall sell the 
properties adjudicated as quickly as possible at market terms. 
 
The Administrators also undertake to inform the Managing Company (at the intervals 
and in the format required by the Managing Company at that moment in time) of any 
non-payments, early repayments and modifications of interest rates and of any calls 
for payment, court action and any other circumstances that affect the Mortgage 
Loans. Each Administrator also undertakes to provide the Managing Company with all 
the documents the Managing Company may ask it to provide with regard to said 
Loans and in particular the documents needed in order for the Managing Company to 
initiate, when appropriate, legal action. 
 
Right to take action against the Administrators  
 
The Managing Company, acting as the representative of and for the account of the 
Fund, shall have the right to take action against the Administrators to enforce 
payment of any amounts of principal and interest that have fallen due with regard to 
the Mortgage Loans, whenever the failure to make such payments is not the result of 
any non-performance on the part of the Debtors of the Loans. 
 
Likewise, in the event that the Assignors fail to fulfil their obligations deriving from the 
Formation Deed and the contracts signed with the Managing Company, acting as the 
representative and for the account of the Fund, the Fund, acting through the 
Managing Company, shall be entitled to take declarative action against the Assignors 
who fail to fulfil said obligations, always in accordance with the formalities provided 
for said proceedings in the Civil Proceedings Act.  
 
After the Mortgage Loans have been extinguished, the Fund, acting through the 
Managing Company, shall retain the right to take action against the Administrators 
until they have fully complied with all their obligations. 
 
12. 
Reporting duties 
 
The Administrators must provide the Managing Company with such information as it 
may request (at the intervals and in the format required by the Managing Company at 
129 


 
 
 
that moment in time) relating (a) to the individual characteristics of each of the 
Mortgage Loans, (b) to compliance by the borrowers of their obligations stemming 
from the Mortgage Loans, and (c) to any overdue payments concerning the Mortgage 
Loans and to any changes there have been in the characteristics of said Loans, as well 
as any action taken in cases of late payment and any auctions of properties, and must 
keep copies as proof of these notifications on their files. 
 
The Administrators must also notify the Managing Company of any failure on the part 
of the Mortgage Securities and the Mortgage Transfer Certificates, and also the 
Mortgage Loans to comply or be in line with the statements provided for in section 
IV.1.a) of the Prospectus, as soon as they become aware thereof.  
 
The Administrators must prepare and provide the Managing Company with any 
reasonable, additional information relating to the Mortgage Loans or the rights 
deriving therefrom that may be requested by the Managing Company. 
 
13. 
Subrogations 
 
The Administrators shall be authorised to allow the position of the Debtor to be 
subrogated in the Mortgage Loans, provided that: 
 
(a)  
the characteristics of the new Debtor are similar to those of the former Debtor;  
 
(b) 
the subrogations meet the criteria laid down by the Administrator in question 
for all the other mortgage loans in its portfolio in its Memorandum on Criteria 
for Granting Loans, attached as an Appendix to the Formation Deed; 
 
(c) 
the subrogations do not affect the administration of the Mortgage Loans; 
 
(d) 
and as long as the expenses arising from said change are entirely for the 
account of the Debtors.  
 
Any subrogation carried out in accordance with the terms of this section must be 
notified by the Administrators to the Managing Company forthwith. 
 
In the event that the Debtor were to ask, when the subrogation takes place, for a 
renegotiation of the terms and conditions governing the Mortgage Loan in question, 
the general rules set out above shall apply.  
 
Any other subrogation or change in title to the Mortgage Loans must be approved 
beforehand by the Managing Company. 
 
130 


 
 
 
14. 
Notification of assignment of the Mortgage Loans  
 
In the event that, should the cases provided for under the Administration Agreement 
arise (bankruptcy proceedings, intervention by the Bank of Spain or the liquidation of 
one or more Administrators), any Administrator has to be replaced, or in the event 
that the Managing Company were to deem this to be appropriate in order to protect 
the interests of the holders of the Securities, the Managing Company may call on the 
outgoing Administrator to notify the Debtors that their respective Mortgage Loans 
have been assigned to the Fund, and that the payments deriving therefrom will be 
deemed effectively made against the debt if they are paid into the corresponding 
account designated by the Managing Company (except in the case where an 
Administrator goes into bankruptcy proceedings or is liquidated, in which case, the 
Managing Company shall itself notify the Debtors accordingly as soon as it learns of 
the bankruptcy proceedings).  
 
In the event that the Administrator concerned were to fail to fulfil the requirement of 
the Managing Company within five (5) Business Days after receiving it, the Managing 
Company shall proceed to send out said notice itself, any contractual liability incurred 
by the non-performing Administrator as a result of its non-performance 
notwithstanding. 
 
IV.3 
General information about the mortgage loan policies set up by the issuers 
of the Mortgage Securities and Certificates bundled together in the Fund 
 
Every one of the Assignors gives the Managing Company its guarantee that the 
information set out in this Section is valid and is a true view of the actual situation, 
and that the principles set out herebelow have been followed when granting each and 
every one of the Mortgage Loans.

Securities and Certificates for analysing risks and granting mortgage loans  
 
The Mortgage Loans have been granted by the Assignors following their standard 
procedures. A description of these procedures is provided in an Appendix to the 
Formation Deed of the Fund. 
 
IV.3.2  Statistical information about trends in non-performance in the Assignors' 
credit portfolio 
 
This section includes a series of tables that show trends in the loans granted for each 
Assignor over the last five (5) years, granted to finance residential properties, stating

Securities and Certificates bundled together in the Fund 
 
Set out below are several stratified tables that analyse the Securitisable Mortgage 
Loan Portfolio of the Assignors which consist of 4,739 loans with a Balance 
Outstanding, as at 29 March 2005, of 425,282,276.71 euros which has been audited 
by the firm PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS AUDITORES, S.L. On the date the Fund is 
set up, the Assignors shall proceed to select the Mortgage Loans from this portfolio, 
which are to be the object of the Mortgage Securities and Certificates that shall be 
bundled together in the assets of the Fund. 
 
The Portfolio of Securitisable Mortgage Loans of the Assignors consisting of (a) 8,802 
loans (with a balance outstanding as at 29 March 2005 amounting to 303,577,597.65

V.1.1 
Hypotheses assumed with regard to the central or most probable indices for 
the parameters early repayment, arrears in the payment of non-payments, 
and bad-debts, for the Securities and Certificates that are bundled together 
in the Fund 
 
The tables set out in section V.1.3 below refer to several of the scenarios that might 
arise for income received and payments made by the Fund during the life of the Fund 
and the Securities issue. 
 
When drawing up these charts of the financial servicing of the Securities and the 
Fund's cash flows, the following hypotheses have been used: 
 
a) 
Mortgage Loans 
 
(i) 
Number and Balance Outstanding: 4,457 mortgage loans integrated in 
the 
Portfolio 
of 
Securitisable 
Mortgage 
Loans 
audited 
by 
PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS AUDITORES, S.L., with a balance of 
370,000,000 euros. 
 
140 


 
 
 
(ii) 
Interest Rate: the weighted average interest rate of the 4,457 mortgage 
loans selected from the Portfolio of Securitisable Mortgage Loans referred 
to above was, as at 29 March 2005, 3.86% per annum. 
 
(iii) 
Rates of Early Repayment: three scenarios at annual rates of 0%, 5% 
and 10%. 
 
(iv) 
Non-performing loans: 0%. 
 
b) 
Assets 
 
(i) 
Amount: 370,000,000.00 euros. 
 
(ii) 
Principal: 100% holding. 
 
(iii) 
Interest: holding calculated at the same rate of interest as applies to a 
Mortgage Loan. 
 
c) 
Bonds  
 
(i) 
Total amount: 370,000,000 euros, divided into 342,200,000 euros in 
Tranche A (it is assumed here that the subscriber to the Tranche A Bond 
has paid in the nominal value thereof, as the difference between the 
issue price and the nominal price has been paid in by the subscriber of 
each Fixed-Income Security IO) and 27,800,000 euros in Tranche B. 
 
(ii) 
Interest rate: floating interest rate corresponding to the balances 
outstanding in Bond Tranches A and B.  
 
It is assumed that the Nominal Interest Rate is, for the first Interest 
Accrual Period, 2.250% for the Tranche A Bonds and 2.750% for the 
Tranche B Bonds and for the second and successive Interest Accrual 
Periods, 2.233% for the Tranche A Bonds and 2.733% for the Tranche B 
Bonds. 
 
(iii) 
It is assumed that the Managing Company will exercise the option to 
redeem the Bonds early when the Outstanding Balance of the Assets is 
less than 10% of its initial amount. 
 
d) 
Security IO 
 
(i) 
Subscription price: 4,037,960. 
 
141 


 
 
 
(ii) 
Payment IO: on each Payment Date, an amount equal to 0.75% per 
annum (except for the first five Payment Dates, when it is 2.5% per 
annum) of the reference amount of each Fixed-Income Security IO. 
 
e) 
Reserve Fund 
 
Reserve Fund: initial value of 4,625,000 euros. 
 
f) 
Complementary contracts 
 
(i) 
Cash Account 
 
The Cash Account shall be kept at the Financial Agent (who, as indicated 
in section II.4.I, is the CONFEDERACIÓN ESPAÑOLA DE CAJAS DE 
AHORROS). Its obligations shall be as set out in the Financial Service 
Agreement. In the event that the Financial Agent's credit rating were to 
fall, the terms of section III.3.1 hereof shall apply. It is assumed that the 
Financial Agent's credit rating shall not fall below P-1 (MOODY'S) and 
that the Cash Account shall, therefore, continue to be kept by the 
Financial Agent.  
 
Interest Rate: Under the Financial Service Agreement, the balance of the 
Cash Account shall earn interest at a rate equal to the arithmetical 
average of the Average Interbank Interest Rates for the interest accrual 
period less thirty-five (35) basis points (0.35%) calculated for all the 
amounts deposited in the Cash Account (including the Reserve Fund). 
The interest that accrues shall be settled on the first Business Day of the 
month corresponding to each Payment Date and shall be calculated on 
the basis of (i) the effective days existing in each interest accrual period 
(which shall be the same as the calendar quarters that end on the last 
day of the month before the month corresponding to each Payment Date 
(included), except for the first period, which shall include the days as 
from and including the formation date up to, and including, 31 August 
2005) and (ii) a 360-day year. 
 
As the Average Interbank Interest Rate is not known as at the date this 
Prospectus was drawn up, it has been assumed that the amounts 
deposited in the Cash Account shall earn interest at a rate of 1.800% 
over the first accrual period (equal to the result of interpolating the four-
(4)-month Euribor and five-(5)-month Euribor rates published on 21 April 
2005: 2.150% less 35 basis points) and, for the successive accrual 
periods, 1.783% (three-(3)-month Euribor published on 21 April 2005: 
2.133% less 35 basis points). 
 
142 


 
 
 
Finally, for the purposes of the tables below, it has been assumed that 
interest shall start to accrue on the Pay-In Date (as these amounts are of 
little significance prior to said date. Said amounts correspond to the 
interest accrued on the amount of the Reserve Fund as from the Draw-
Down Date of the Subordinate Loan for Start-Up Expenses). 
 
(ii) 
Contract for the Subordinate Loan for Start-Up Expenses 
 
Amount: 1,540,132.87 euros, which shall be used to finance the 
formation expenses of the Fund and the issue of the Bonds and the 
interest on the deferral of payment of the Assets. 
  
Repayment: Under the Contract for the Subordinate Loan for Start-Up 
Expenses , the principal shall be repaid on each Payment Date, in the 
same proportion as said expenses are amortised, over the first 5 years 
after the Fund is set up. 
 
Interest rate: same as the Nominal Interest rate applying to Tranche B 
Bonds in each interest period (these periods shall coincide with the 
Interest Accrual Periods of the Bonds, except for the first accrual period, 
which shall include the days running as from and including the opening 
date of the Subscription Period up to, but not including, the first Payment 
Date). For the purposes of the tables below, it has been assumed that 
the interest on the Subordinate Loan for Start-Up Expenses shall be 
2.733% (except for the first Interest Accrual Period, for which a rate of 
2.750% has been assumed 4.016%). 
 
(iii) Swap Contract Granada 
 
Nominal Amount: 200,000 thousand euros in the first Settlement Period 
equivalent to the outstanding balance of the Hedged Loans Granada (as 
defined in section V.4.4.1) on the date the Fund is set up. In successive 
Settlement Periods, the Nominal Amount shall be the outstanding balance 
of the Hedged Loans Granada on the first day of the Settlement Period. 
 
Amount payable by the Fund: shall be the result of adding together, for 
each Settlement Period, the floating amounts obtained by applying, on 
each Floating Rate A Settlement Date falling during the corresponding 
Settlement Period, the Floating Rate A to the Nominal Amount, multiplied 
by the number of days in the Floating Rate A Settlement Period that 
expires on the current Floating Rate A Settlement Date, divided by 360, 
as these terms are defined in section V.4.4.1. 
 
143 


 
 
 
Amount receivable by the Fund: shall be the result of applying, on the 
final day of every Settlement Period, the Floating Rate B Granada to the 
Nominal Amount, as these terms are defined in accordance with section 
V.4.4.1. 
 
(iv) Credifimo Swap Contract 
 
Nominal Amount: 170,000 thousand euros in the first Settlement Period 
equivalent to the outstanding balance of the Hedged Loans Credifimo (as 
defined in section V.4.4.2) on the date the Fund is set up. In successive 
Settlement Periods, the Nominal Amount shall be the outstanding balance 
of the Hedged Loans Credifimo on the first day of the Settlement Period. 
 
Amount payable by the Fund: shall be the result of adding together, for 
each Settlement Period, the floating amounts obtained by applying, on 
each Floating Rate A Settlement Date falling during the corresponding 
Settlement Period, the Floating Rate A to the Nominal Amount, multiplied 
by the number of days in the Floating Rate A Settlement Period that 
expires on the current Floating Rate Settlement Date, divided by 360, as 
these terms are defined in section V.4.4.1. 
 
Amount receivable by the Fund: shall be the result of applying, on the 
final day of every Settlement Period, the Floating Rate B Credifimo to the 
Nominal Amount, as these terms are defined in accordance with section 
V.4.4.2. 
 
f) 
Fees and Margin 
 
(i) 
Regular Annual Fee of the Managing Company: 0.025% per annum, 
which shall accrue on a quarterly basis as from the preceding Payment 
Date up to the current Payment Date (except for the first accrual period 
of the fee, which shall run from and include the date the Fund is set up 
until, but not including, the first Payment Date), on the sum of the 
Balance Outstanding of the Assets as at the preceding Payment Date, 
subject to a minimum annual fee of 30,050 euros. 
 
For the purposes of the tables below, no increase in the CPI has been 
taken into account. 
 
(ii) 
Financial Service Fee: 0.002% per annum, which shall accrue on a 
quarterly basis as from the preceding Payment Date up to the current 
Payment Date (except for the first accrual period of the fee, which shall 
run from and include the date the Fund is set up until, but not including, 
144 


 
 
 
the first Payment Date), on the Balance Pending Payment on the Bonds 
as at the preceding Payment Date. 
 
(iii) 
Fee for Administering the Assets: 0.01% per annum, which shall accrue 
on a quarterly basis as from the preceding Payment Date up to the 
current Payment Date (except for the first accrual period of the fee, 
which shall run from and include the date the Fund is set up until, but 
not including, the first Payment Date), on the Balance Outstanding of the 
Assets issued by each one of them on the preceding Payment Date, 
including VAT whenever not exempt, payable on a quarterly basis on 
every Payment Date. 
 
(iv) 
Financial Intermediation Margin: floating amount that shall be paid 
quarterly on every Payment Date. The amount paid shall be equal to the 
positive difference, if there is any, between the Available Funds of the 
Fund and the amounts payable on each Payment Date for the first twelve 
(12) items on the Payment Priority Order provided for in section 
V.5.1.B)2 of the Prospectus. 
 
g) 
Current expenses, including 
 
(i) 
Front-End Fee of the Managing Company: payable on a one-off basis on 
the Pay-in Date. For the purposes of the table below, it is assumed to be 
0.03% of the Balance of the Assets on the date the Fund is set up. 
 
(ii) 
Ordinary expenses (annual audits of the Fund, review and maintenance 
of ratings and publishing announcements):  15,000 euros. 
 
V.1.2 
Analysis and comments of the impact that any eventual changes in the 
hypotheses described in the previous point would have on the financial 
equilibrium of the Fund 
 
The quality of the Mortgage Securities and Certificates and the systems used to 
ensure the Fund's financial equilibrium are such that it is not reasonable to consider 
percentage rates of early repayment, or non-performing and bad loans so extreme 
that the equilibrium of the Fund's financial structure would be lost, as a result of the 
required transfer of the risk of early repayment and of non-payment occurring in the 
Mortgage Loans. 
 
Regarding the impact that early repayment of the Mortgage Loans may have on the 
Bonds, section II.12.b) of the Prospectus sets out a performance chart for the average 
life and duration of the Bonds for different, constant, effective rates of early 
repayment or prepayment. 
 
145 


 
 
 
V.1.3 
Numerical outline of the income and expense flows of Funds. 
 
The numerical outline transcribed below refers to collections and payments, using a 
cash basis of accounting, so as to make it clearer for investors, although the Fund 
shall record income and expense on the accruals basis. 
 
This outline is based not only on the hypotheses mentioned in section V.1.1 above, 
but also on said hypotheses remaining constant throughout the life of the Fund. As is 
known, the variables in question, in particular the interest rates of the Bonds in all the 
Tranches, and the real rates of early repayment of the Mortgage Loans to the 
Mortgage Securities and Certificates, change all the time. 
 
This numerical outline is, therefore, only valuable as an illustration. 
 
For the purposes of the tables below: 
 
(i) 
The "Average Rate" is defined as the average rate of interest on the Mortgage 
Loans, weighted by the Balance Outstanding on each one of them; 
 
(ii) 
“The "Average Life" is defined as the average duration of the Mortgage Loans, 
weighted by the Balance Outstanding on each one of them, expressed in 
months.

V.2 
Accounting principles used by the Fund 
 
Income and expense are recorded by the Fund on an accrual basis, i.e. based on the 
real flow represented by such income and expense, regardless of when they are 
actually collected and paid. 
 
The financial period of the Fund is the same as the calendar year. However, an 
exception to this shall be the first financial period, which shall begin on the date the 
Fund is set up, and the final financial period, which shall end on the date the Fund is 
extinguished. 
 
V.3 
Description of the aim or objective of the financial operations contracted by 
the Managing Company for the account of the Fund for the purpose of 
improving risk, increasing the regularity of the payments, neutralising 
differences in rates of interest coming from the Mortgage Securities and 
Certificates or, in general, changing the financial characteristics of all or 
part of these securities 
 
In order to consolidate the financial structure and ensure the greatest possible cover 
for the risks inherent in the issue, the Managing Company, acting as the 
representative and for the account of the Fund, shall proceed, on the same date as 
the Formation Deed is executed, to formally enter into the contracts listed below. 
 
The Managing Company, in order for the Fund to operate in accordance with the 
terms set out in this Prospectus, in the Formation Deed and in the rules in force at the 
time, may extend or renew modifications of the contracts that it has signed on behalf 
of the Fund, replace any of the counterparties thereto and even, should this prove 
necessary, enter into additional contracts; all of which subject to the legislation in 
force at the time, to the prior authorisation, whenever required, for the CNMV, or the 
competent administrative body and to it being notified to the Rating Agency, provided 
that such action does not damage the interests of the holders of the Securities. 
 
V.3.1 Financial Services Agreement (Payment Agent for the Securities) 
 
The Managing Company, acting as the representative of and for the account of the 
Fund, shall enter into the an agreement with the Financial Agent (who, as indicated in 
section II.4.1 is the CONFEDERACIÓN ESPAÑOLA DE CAJAS DE AHORROS) to provide 
the financial service for the issue of the Securities issued against the Fund's assets 
(the "Finance Service Agreement"). 
 
Set out below is a brief description of the obligations set out in the Financial Services 
Agreement regarding the payments agent: 
 
153 


 
 
 
(i) 
to provide the Managing Company, within four(4) Business Days after the Pay-
in Date, with the information statements, duly filled in by every one of the 
Underwriting Entities, regarding the extent of the distribution achieved when 
placing the Securities issue, using the standard form designed for this purpose 
by the CNMV, analysed by Tranches; 
 
(ii) 
on every one of the Payment Dates of the Securities, to pay the interest any, 
whenever applicable, to repay the corresponding part of the principal of the 
Bonds to the bondholders, after deducting the total amount of any withholding 
on account for investment income that must be made under applicable tax law, 
and to make any other payments that are required charged against the Fund 
under the terms of the Prospectus and the Formation Deed;  
 
(iii) 
on each Date for Setting the Interest Rate, to notify the Managing Company the 
benchmark Euribor interest rate, or the rate that replaces it, in accordance with 
the terms of section II.10.c), that is to be used as a basis for calculating the 
Nominal Interest Rate applying to the Bonds in each of the Tranches; 
 
(iv) 
to provide the Managing Company with whatever information may be needed 
or advisable for the Managing Company to be able to fulfil the Fund's 
obligations, in particular its tax obligations, representing and acting for the 
account of the Fund; and 
 
(v) 
to instruct the SYSTEMS COMPANY appropriately until the Pay-in Date. 
 
Under the terms of the Financial Services Agreement, the Financial Agent shall also 
take on the depositing of the multiple certificates that represent the Mortgage 
Securities and the Mortgage Transfer Certificates subscribed by the Fund. 
 
In return for the services the Financial Agent is to provide, the Fund shall pay it an 
annual fee of 0.002% of the Outstanding Balance of the Bonds on the preceding 
Payment Date, payable for the preceding quarter on each Payment Date (the 
"Financial Service Fee"). The Financial Service Fee shall accrue on a quarterly 
basis, over the period starting on the preceding Payment Date and ending on the 
current Payment Date (except for the first period, which shall run from the Pay-In 
Date to the first Payment Date).  
 
The Financial Services Fee shall be calculated on the basis of: (i) the effective days 
existing in each of the fee's accrual periods (which shall be the same as the Interest 
Accrual Periods of the Securities, except for the first period, which shall run from and 
include the Pay-In Date of the Fund until, but not including, the first Payment Date) 
and (ii) a three-hundred-and-sixty-five-day (365) year (Current/365). 
 
154 


 
 
 
The Managing Company, acting as the representative of and for the account of the 
Fund, shall open a Cash Account at the Financial Agent. In accordance with the terms 
of the Financial Services Agreement, the following amounts shall be paid into the Cash 
Account: 
 
(i) 
the effective amount, net of the Underwriting and/or Management Fees, for 
paying in the subscription of the Securities; 
 
(ii) 
the principal and interest on the Mortgage Securities and Certificates; 
 
(iii) 
any amounts received as payment for the principal or ordinary or late-payment 
interest on the Mortgage Loans, be it for the auction price or amount set by the 
court order or notarial proceedings when foreclosing on the mortgage securities 
or for disposing of or operating the assets adjudicated when foreclosing on the 
mortgage securities or as a result of such foreclosures, for the interim 
administration and possession of the properties during the foreclosure 
procedure, as well as any rights or indemnities to which the Assignors may be 
entitled including not only the rights and indemnities deriving from the damage 
insurance contracts assigned by the Assignors to the Fund, but also the rights 
and indemnities deriving from any right that is accessory to the loan; 
 
(iv) 
the amounts that make up the Reserve Fund at any time; 
 
(v) 
whenever appropriate, the amounts that are payable by the Counterpart Entity 
under the terms of the Swap Contracts described in section V.4.4; 
 
(vi) 
whenever appropriate, the amounts that are payable by the Counterpart Entity 
under the terms of the Option Contracts described in section V.4.5; 
 
(vii) 
the amounts that make up the returns made on the balances in the Cash 
Account itself; 
 
(viii) the proceeds of the draw-downs on the Subordinate Loan for Start-Up 
Expenses;  
 
(ix) 
any late-payment interest owed by the Underwriting Entities in the case of 
delays in paying the amounts owed under the Underwriting Agreement; 
 
(x) 
the amounts of the withholdings on account of any investment income which, in 
accordance with the legislation in force at the time during the life of the Fund, 
must be made on each Payment Date for the interest on the Bonds and the 
Payment IO paid by the Fund, until such time as it must be paid to the Tax 
Authorities or the holders of the Securities call for them to be refunded. 
 
155 


 
 
 
Under the terms of the Financial Services Agreement, the Financial Agent guarantees 
that the balance of the Cash Account at any time shall earn a return equal to the 
arithmetical mean of the Average Interbank Rates for the interest accrual period, less 
thirty-five (35) basis points (0.35%). The interest that accrues shall be settled on the 
first Business Day of the month corresponding to each Payment Date and shall be 
calculated on the basis of (i) the effective days existing in each interest accrual period 
(which shall be the same as the calendar quarters that end on the last day of the 
month before the month corresponding to each Payment Date (included), except for 
the first period, which shall include the days as from and including the formation date 
up to, and including, 31 August 2005) and (ii) a 360-day year. 
 
The above notwithstanding, the Managing Company, in order to cover any time leads 
and lags between the schedule of flows of redemption of the principal and interest of 
the Assets and of the Securities issued, the balance of the Cash Account (until the 
next Calculation Date) may be invested on a short-term basis by acquiring fixed-
income assets with terms that are shorter than the time remaining until the next 
Calculation Date that falls after the date on which the current-asset investment is 
made, denominated in euros, issued by issuers with ratings of at least P-1 (on the 
MOODY'S scale) for short-term risks, provided that the return on the current-asset 
investment, net of charges and other expenses, is at least equal to the guaranteed 
minimum rate of the balance of the Cash Account (the arithmetical average of the 
Average Interbank Rates for the interest accrual period less thirty-five (35) basis 
points). In the event that the assets in which said current-asset investment is made 
are repos, the counterparty of the repo operation must have a rating of at least P-1 
(on the MOODY'S scale) for short-term risks. 
 
In the event that at any moment of the Securities issue, the credit rating of the short-
term unsecured unsubordinated debt of the Financial Agent were to fall below P-1 (on 
the MOODY'S scale), the Managing Company shall transfer, within a maximum of 
thirty (30) Business Days as from when said downgrading in rating occurs, the 
amounts deposited in the Cash Account to such other accounts opened with another 
credit institution whose short-term unsecured unsubordinated debt is rated P-1 (on 
the MOODY'S scale), contracting the highest possible returns for the balances of the 
Cash Account, unless the Financial Agent obtains, within said thirty (30) day period, a 
several guarantee at first request for its obligations from a credit institution with said 
ratings and the ratings granted for the Securities by the Rating Agency are not 
downgraded. In the event that the amounts deposited in the Cash Account were to be 
transferred to another account opened at another credit institution, said latter credit 
institution, after signing such documents as may be appropriate, shall become the 
Financial Agent for the operation, subrogating all the rights and obligations of the 
Financial Agent being replaced.  
 
The Managing Company may, however, transfer the balance of the Cash Account to 
the replaced Financial Agent later, provided that it is given the guarantee referred to 
156 


 
 
 
in the previous paragraph or the replaced Financial Agent's rating goes back up to P-1 
(on the MOODY'S scale), after the appropriate documents have been signed. 
 
V.3.2 
Contract for the Subordinate Loan for Start-Up Expenses 
 
The Managing Company shall, representing and acting for the account of the Fund, 
enter into a subordinated loan agreement with the Assignors (in said capacity, each 
one being a "Lending Entity"), for an amount of ONE MILLION, FIVE HUNDRED AND 
FORTY THOUSAND, ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY-TWO EUROS, EIGHTY-SEVEN 
CENTS (€ 1,540,132.87) which shall be used to finance the formation expenses of the 
Fund and of the Securities issue and to finance the interest payable to the Assignors 
on the deferred payment of the price for subscribing to the Assets until the Pay-in 
Date and to make the initial appropriation of the part of the Amount Required for the 
Reserve Fund over and above the subscription price of the Security IO (the 
"Subordinated Loan for Start-Up Expenses”). 
 
The principal of the Subordinate Loan for Start-Up Expenses shall be paid in by the 
Lending Entities in the following proportions (as a guideline): 
 
LENDING ENTITY 
SHARE (EUROS) 
CAJA GENERAL DE AHORROS DE GRANADA 
832,504.26 
UNIÓN DE CRÉDITO PARA LA FINANCIACIÓN MOBILIARIA 
E INMOBILIARIA, CREDIFIMO, E.F.C., S.A. 
707,628.61 
Total 
1,540,132.87 
 
The final amount of the Subordinate Loan for Start-Up Expenses, and each Lending 
Entity's share of the principal of the Subordinated Loan for Start-Up Expenses (which 
shall not become known until the subscription price of the Security IO is set), shall be 
included in the Formation Deed of the Fund and shall be notified to the CNMV as 
additional information to be included in the Prospectus. 
 
The total amount of the Subordinate Loan for Start-Up Expenses shall be handed over 
as a single lump sum by the Lending Entities by 10:00 a.m. on the opening date of 
the Subscription Period of the Securities (the "Draw-Down Date of the 
Subordinate Loan for Start-Up Expenses"), same day value, paid into the Cash 
Account. 
 
Interest shall accrue on the Subordinate Loan for Start-Up Expenses as from the 
Draw-Down Date of the Subordinate Loan for Start-Up Expenses, at an annual floating 
nominal interest rate set every quarter, which shall be equal to the Nominal Interest 
Rate set for the Tranche B Bonds in each interest period (which shall be the same as 
the Interest Accrual Periods of the Securities, except for the first accrual period, which 
shall run from and include the date the Subscription Period opens until, but not 
including, the first Payment Date). 
 
The interest on the Subordinate Loan for Formation Expenses shall be payable on 
each Payment Day of the Securities (i.e., every quarter on 21 March, June, September 
and December every year), in accordance with the Payment Priority Order set in 
section V.5.1.B)2.a) hereof, and with the exceptional rules laid down in section V.5.2. 
157 


 
 
 
 
This interest shall be paid to the Lending Entities only when the Fund has sufficient 
Available Funds subject to the payment priority order set in section V.5.1.B)2 hereof 
and if the the Individual Account (or, whenever appropriate, the Adjusted Individual 
Account) of the Lending Entity in question, calculated in accordance with the terms of 
the Internal Management Agreement, gives a positive result. The accrued interest due 
to be paid on a specific Payment Date shall be calculated on the following basis: (i) 
the effective days in each interest accrual period and (ii) a three-hundred-and-sixty 
(360) day year. 
 
Under no circumstances may any failure to pay the interest on the loan be deemed to 
be a non-performance of the Contract for the Subordinate Loan for Start-Up Expenses 
(or of the obligation to pay interest provided for therein) when the non-payment of 
such interest is due to insufficient Funds Available in accordance with the Payment 
Priority Order or, with regard to each Lending Entity, that the positive balance of the 
Individual Account (or if the Individual Account (or the Adjusted Individual Account, 
depending on the case) of the Lending Entity in question is not sufficient, as indicated 
in the previous paragraph. 
 
The part of the Subordinated Loan for Start-Up Expenses that has effectively been 
used to finance the formation expenses of the Fund and the Securities issue, to 
finance the interest on deferring payment of the price of subscribing to the Assets 
until the Pay-In Date, shall be paid back as and when the formation and issue 
expenses are amortised, in accordance with the Fund's official accounts and, in any 
case, over a period of no more than five (5) years as from the formation of the Fund, 
provided that the Fund has sufficient Funds Available in accordance with the Payment 
Priority Order provided for in section V.5.1.B)2.a) of the Prospectus and the Adjusted 
Individual Account of the Lending Entity to which the Loan is to be repaid, calculated 
in accordance with the terms of the Internal Management Agreement, records a 
sufficiently large positive balance. The part of the principal of the Subordinated Loan 
for Start-Up Expenses that has not been used may be paid back on the first Payment 
Date, in accordance with the Payment Priority Order. 
 
These repayments shall be distributed among the Lending Entities by the Managing 
Company, in accordance with the terms of the Internal Management Agreement. 
 
Interest and principal accruing but not paid on a Payment Date shall accumulate and 
be subject to late-payment interest at the same rate as the rate for the Subordinate 
Loan for Start-Up Expenses applying during the corresponding interest period and 
shall be paid on the following Payment Date, provided that the Fund has sufficient 
Funds Available in accordance with the Payment Priority Order set in section 
V.5.1.B)2.a) hereof and provided that the Individual Account (or, whenever 
appropriate, the Adjusted Individual Account) of the Lending Entity in question, 
calculated in accordance with the terms of the Internal Management Agreement, gives 
a positive result. 
 
158 


 
 
 
The Subordinate Loan for Start-Up Expenses, because it is subordinated, shall come 
after the payments that the Fund must make to the holders of the Securities and 
other common creditors of the Fund, in accordance with the Payment Priority Order 
provided for in section V.5.1.B)2.a) hereof. 
 
The Subordinate Loan for Start-Up Expenses shall remain in force until 21 March 
2038, or the following Business Day (Legal Date of Maturity) or until the earlier date 
on which the Fund has returned any amounts owed under the Subordinated Contract 
for Start-Up Expenses to the Lending Entities and the obligations of the Fund 
thereunder have been completely extinguished. 
 
V.3.3 
Reserve Fund 
 
In order to enable the Fund to meet its payment obligations, the Managing Company, 
acting as the representative of and for the account of the Fund, shall set up a reserve 
fund, the amount of which shall be deposited in the Cash Account (the "Reserve 
Fund”). 
 
The characteristics of the Reserve Fund are as set out below: 
 
159 


 
 
 
 
 
(i) 
Amount 
 
The Reserve Fund is initially funded with an amount equal to the Amount Required for 
the Reserve Fund (as this term is defined herebelow) charged to (i) the subscription 
price of the Security IO (the initial amount of the Reserve Fund is estimated to be 
equal to 1.1% of the opening balance of the Bonds) and (ii) part of the Subordinate 
Loan for Start-Up Expenses. 
 
The amount of the Reserve Fund required during the entire life of the Fund (the 
"Amount Required for the Reserve Fund") shall be equal to 1.25% of the 
opening balance of the Bonds, i.e. FOUR MILLION SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIVE 
THOUSAND EUROS (€ 4,625,000). 
 
(ii) 
Return 
 
The amount of the Reserve Fund shall be deposited, during the life of the Fund, in the 
Cash Account opened in the Fund's name at the Financial Agent. The return on said 
account shall be as provided for in the Finance Service Agreement referred to in 
section V.3.1 hereof). 
 
(iii)  
Use 
 
The Reserve Fund shall be used, on each Payment Date as from when it is set up, to 
meet its payment obligations in accordance with the Payment Priority Order set in 
section V.5.1.B)2.a) hereof. 
 
 
V.4 
Other contracts 
 
V.4.1 
Managing the Mortgage Loans  
 
The Assignors shall sign with the Managing Company, acting as the representative 
and for the account of the Fund, an Administration Agreement under which they shall, 
acting as agents of the Fund continue to (i) hold in safekeeping and administer the 
Mortgage Loans; and (ii) shall receive, as collection managers, all the amounts that 
are paid by the Debtors under the Mortgage Loans, until such time as, in accordance 
with the Administration Agreement, said amounts are to be transferred to the Cash 
Account. 
 
In return for the services to be provided to administer the Mortgage Loans, each of 
the Assignors shall be entitled to receive, on each Payment Date, during the period 
the Administration Agreement is in force, a Fee for Administering the Assets for the 
160 


 
 
 
period then ending, equal to 0.01% a year, including VAT whenever not VAT-exempt, 
of the Balance Outstanding on the Assets on the preceding Payment Date, as long as 
the Fund has sufficient Funds Available (after it has met its payment obligations, in 
accordance with the payment priority order of the Fund described in section V.5.1.B)2 
hereof) and if the Individual Account (or, whenever appropriate, the Adjusted 
Individual Account) of the Assignor, calculated in accordance with the terms of the 
Internal Management Agreement, gives a positive result. 
 
The Administration Fee shall be calculated on the basis of: (i) the effective days 
existing in each of the fee's accrual periods (which shall be the same as the Interest 
Accrual Periods of the Securities, except for the first period, which shall run from and 
include the date the Fund is set up until, but not including, the first Payment Date) 
and (ii) a three-hundred-and-sixty-five-day (365) year (Current/365). 
 
V.4.2 
Placement and Underwriting Contract for the Securities 
 
The Managing Company, representing and acting for the account of the Fund, shall 
enter into an Underwriting Agreement for the Securities issue with the Underwriting 
Entities, under which the Underwriting Entities shall freely allot to third parties the 
entire issue of the Securities and, after the Subscription Period ends, shall subscribe 
on their own behalf to the number of Securities that have remained unsubscribed up 
to the total number underwritten by each one of them under the terms of their 
respective underwriting commitments. 
 
The Underwriting Entities shall enter into the obligations set out in the Underwriting 
Agreement which are basically as follows: 
 
1)  
 Commitment to subscribe to any Securities that have not been subscribed when 
the Subscription Period ends, up to the amounts stipulated. 
 
2)  
To pay in to the Fund, by making a transfer to the Cash Account, by 11:00 a.m. 
on the Pay-in Date, same day value, the total amount underwritten on the 
issue, deducting, as appropriate, the amount of its respective Underwriting Fees 
and, wherever applicable, the Management Fee or, if the Underwriting Entities 
so choose (when they are not a Lead Manager), crediting the amount of their 
respective underwriting commitments to any of the Lead Managers (after 
deducting, wherever appropriate, the amount of their respective Underwriting 
Fees), so that the Lead Managers may proceed to pay into the Fund, by that 
time: (i) the amount they have underwritten (after deducting, as appropriate, 
the amount of their Underwriting Fee and their Management Fee) together with 
(ii) the amounts received from the Underwriting Entities which have opted for 
this paying-in method, acting on behalf of and for the account of said

Underwriting Entities. The Underwriting Fees that will be charged by each of the 
Underwriting Entities shall be: 
 
 
Between 0.075% and 0.150% of the total nominal amount of the Bonds in 
Tranche A they underwrite;  
 
Between 0.150% and 0.250% of the total nominal amount of the Bonds in 
Tranche B they underwrite. 
 
For the purposes hereof, it has been assumed that the Underwriting Fee will be:  
 
 
0.100% of the total nominal amount of the Tranche A Bonds it underwrites;  
 
of the total nominal amount of the Tranche B Bonds it underwrites. 
 
Underwriting the Fixed-Income Securities IO does not entitle to collect the 
Underwriting Fee. 
 
V.4.3 
Internal Management Contract 
 
The Managing Company, acting as the representative of and for the account of the 
Fund, shall enter into an internal management agreement with the Assignors for the 
purpose of remunerating each of the Assignors for the financial intermediation process 
gone through (the "Internal Management Agreement”).  
 
The remuneration consists of a subordinated, floating amount that shall be settled 
every quarter on each Payment Date. Said amount shall be equal to the positive 
difference, if any, between the Available Funds of the Fund and any amounts that 
must be paid out under the first fourteen (14) items on the Payment Priority Order. 
Payments under this heading shall be distributed among the Assignors on every 
Payment Date subject to the terms of the Payment Priority Order in accordance with 
the terms of the Internal Management Agreement. 
 
162 


 
 
 
V.4.4 
Swap Contracts 
 
The Managing Company, acting as the representative of and for the account of the 
Fund, shall enter into two swap contracts with one or more Spanish credit institutions 
(each of which shall hereinafter be referred to as a "Counterparty Entity"), in 
accordance with the standard Outline Financial Operation Agreement (OFOA) of the 
Spanish Banking Association, for the purpose of hedging against the interest rate 
exposure associated with the portfolios of CAJA GENERAL DE AHORROS DE GRANADA 
(the “Swap Contract Granada”) and of UNIÓN DE CRÉDITO PARA LA 
FINANCIACIÓN MOBILIARIA E INMOBILIARIA, CREDIFIMO, E.F.C., S.A. (the “Swap 
Contract Credifimo” and jointly with the Swap Contract Granada, the “Swap 
Contracts”). 
 
V.4.4.1 Swap Contract Granada 
 
The Swap Contract Granada covers the risk arising from the Mortgage Loans assigned 
by CAJA GENERAL DE AHORROS DE GRANADA (by issuing Mortgage Securities and 
Mortgage Transfer Certificates) whose benchmark rates that are used as a basis for 
setting the interest applying thereto are for annual horizons (the Hedged Loans 
Granada").  
 
The amounts payable by each of the parties to the Swap Contract Granada, 
respectively, on each Payment Date shall be as follows: 
 
(a) 
Amount payable by the Fund ("Floating Amount A"): shall be the result of 
adding together, for each Settlement Period ending on the latest Calculation 
Date before said Payment Date, the floating amounts obtained by applying, on 
each Floating Rate A Settlement Date falling during the corresponding 
Settlement Period, the Floating Rate A to the Nominal Amount, multiplied by 
the number of days in the Floating Rate A Settlement Period that expires on the 
corresponding Floating Rate A Settlement Date, divided by 360.  
 
(b) 
Amount payable by the Counterparty Entity ("Floating Amount B Granada”): 
shall be the result of applying, on the final day of every Settlement Period that 
ends on the latest Calculation Date before said Payment Date, the Floating Rate 
B to the Nominal Amount multiplied by the number of days in the current 
Settlement Period and divided by 360. 
 
For the purposes of this section, the following definitions shall be taken into account: 
 
“Nominal Amount” means, for each Settlement Period, the Balance Outstanding on 
the Hedged Loans Granada on the first day of the preceding Settlement Period for 
which the amounts due are not more than 90 days overdue on the last day thereof 
(including the Hedged Loans Granada that have been repaid in said period). For the 
first Liquidation Period, the initial Nominal Amount shall be the same as the Balance 
Outstanding on the Hedged Loans Granada on the date the Fund is set up for which 
163 


 
 
 
the amounts due are not more than 90 days overdue on the last day thereof 
(including the Hedged Loans Granada that have been repaid in said period). On the 
second (2nd) last Business Day before each Payment Date, the Managing Company, 
acting on behalf of and representing the Fund, shall notify the Floating Swap Nominal 
Amount that is to apply to the Settlement Period that has ended three (3) Business 
Days earlier. 
 
“ Floating Rate A" means, for each Settlement Date of the Floating Rate A, the 
aggregate of (i) in the case of the Hedged Loans Granada for which the applicable 
interest rate is subject to annual adjustments, a weighting of the twelve-(12)-month 
Euribor rate on each of the twelve (12) Reference Dates A corresponding to the 
Settlement Date of the Floating Rate A (said terms being deemed to be the Reference 
Date A falling on the fourteenth (14th) last calendar month prior to the Floating Rate 
A Settlement Date and the eleven (11) Reference Dates A following immediately after 
said Reference Date A) (as said weightings are stipulated in the Swap Contract 
Granada) and (ii) in the case of the Hedged Loans Granada for which the applicable 
rate is subject to six-monthly adjustments, a weighting of the twelve-(12)-month 
Euribor rate on each of the six (6) Reference Dates A corresponding to the Settlement 
Date of the Floating Rate A (said terms being deemed to be the Reference Date A 
falling on the eighth (8th) last calendar month prior to the Floating Rate A Settlement 
Date and the five (5) Reference Dates A following immediately after said Reference 
Date A) (as said weightings are stipulated in the Swap Contract Granada). On the 
second (2nd) last Business Day before each Payment Date, the Managing Company, 
acting on behalf of and representing the Fund, shall notify the Floating Rate A that is 
to apply to the Settlement Period that has ended three (3) Business Days earlier. 
 
Each "Settlement Date for the Floating Rate A" shall fall on the fifth (5th) last 
Business Day before the 21st day of every month (the first Settlement Date for the 
Floating Rate A shall be 16 May 2005). 
 
Each "Settlement Period for the Floating Rate A" shall include the days that 
effectively elapse between each Settlement Date for the Floating Rate A, not including 
the first day and including the last day (except for the First Settlement Period for the 
Floating Rate A, which shall cover the days elapsed as from, but not including the 
date the Fund is set up, up to and including 16 May 2005).   
 
Each "Reference Date A" coincides with the fifth (5th) last Business Day before the 
21st of every month, starting, (i) in the case of the Hedged Loans Granada for which 
the applicable interest rate is subject to annual adjustments, on 16 April 2004 and (ii) 
in the case of the Hedged Loans Granada for which the applicable rate is subject to 
six-monthly adjustments, on 16 August 2004.   
 
“Variable Rate B Granada" means, for each Settlement Period, the benchmark 
interest rate calculated in accordance with the terms of section II.10.1.c) hereof for 
the current Interest Accrual Period plus a spread of between fourteen (14) and 
164 


 
 
 
twenty-oney (21) basis points (0.14% and 0.21%, respectively) applied by the 
percentage represented on the first day of the Settlement Period by the Balance 
Outstanding on the Hedged Loans Granada over the Nominal Amount for said 
Settlement Period. The final spreads shall be set in the Swap Contract Granada. 
 
As the Swap Contract Granada is a contractual compensation agreement, on each 
Payment Date the parties shall be entitled to demand from one another the net 
balance of operations accrued. 
  
The Swap Contract Granada shall be divided into successive periods referred to as 
"Settlement Periods", consisting of the days elapsed between two consecutive 
Calculation Dates, not including in each Settlement Period the initial Calculation Date 
and including the final Calculation Date. As an exception, the first Settlement Period 
shall be the period as from (and including) the formation date of the Fund up to, and 
including, the first Calculation Date). 
 
On every Payment Date the Parties must credit the amounts indicated herebelow due 
to the fact that there are caps and floors on the floating interest rates of part of the 
Hedged Loans Granada. 
 
The amount payable to the Fund by the Counterparty Entity shall be the result of 
adding together, for each Settlement Period ending on the latest Calculation Date 
before said Payment Date, the amounts obtained by multiplying, on each Floating 
Rate A Settlement Date falling during the corresponding Settlement Period, (i) the Cap 
Nominal Rate by (ii) the difference, whenever positive, between the benchmark 
interest rate calculated in accordance with the terms of section II.10.1.c) of the 
Prospectus for the current Settlement Period and 13%, multiplied by the number of 
days in the Floating Rate A Settlement Period that expires on the corresponding 
Floating Rate A Settlement Date, divided by 360. 
 
For the purposes of the previous paragraph, "Nominal Amount Cap" means, for 
each Settlement Period, the Balance Outstanding on the Hedged Loans Granada with 
a capped interest rate on the first day of the preceding Settlement Period for which 
the amounts due are not more than 90 days overdue on the last day thereof 
(including the Hedged Loans Granada that have been repaid in said period). On the 
second (2nd) last Business Day before each Payment Date, the Managing Company, 
acting on behalf of and representing the Fund, shall notify the Cap Nominal Amount 
that is to apply to the Calculation Period that has ended three (3) Business Days 
earlier. 
 
The amount payable by the Fund to the Counterparty Entity shall be equal to the 
result of adding together, for each Settlement Period that ends on the last Calculation 
Date before said Payment Date, the amounts obtained by adding together, on each of 
the Floating Rate A Settlement Dates falling during the corresponding Settlement 
165 


 
 
 
Period, the products of (i) the Floor Nominal Amount and (ii) the difference, if it is 
positive, between the minimum interest rate (after deducting, for each Hedge Loan 
Granada, the margin of said loan and, for the Benchmark Index Linked Loans - as 
defined in section V.4.5 - an additional margin of 0.45% shall be deducted) and the 
Floor Floating Rate (as defined herebelow), for each of the pools of Hedged Loans 
Granada that have the same minimum applicable interest rate (after deducting, for 
each Hedge Loan Granada, the margin of said loan and, for the Benchmark Index 
Linked Loans - as defined in section V.4.5 - an additional margin of 0.45% shall be 
deducted), multiplied by the number of days in the corresponding Floating Rate A 
Settlement Period divided by 360. 
 
For the purposes of the previous paragraph, the following definitions must be taken 
into account: 
 
The "Floor Nominal Rate" means, for each Settlement Period, the Outstanding 
Balance of the pool of Hedged Loans Granada with the same minimum interest rate 
(after deducting, for each Hedge Loan Granada, the margin of said loan and, for each 
Benchmark Index Linked Loan Granada, after deducting an additional margin of forty-
five (45) basis points (0.45% )) on the first day of the Settlement Period, for which 
there are no amounts more than 90 days overdue on the last day of the Settlement 
Period (including the Hedged Loans Granada with the same interest rate as has been 
amortised over said period). On the second (2nd) last Business Day before each 
Payment Date, the Managing Company, acting on behalf of and representing the 
Fund, shall notify the Floor Nominal Amount that is to apply to the Settlement Period 
that has ended three (3) Business Days earlier. 
 
"Floating Floor Rate" means, for each Settlement Date of the Floating Rate A, the aggregate 
of (i) in the case of the Hedged Loans Granada for which the applicable interest rate is subject 
to annual adjustments with a limit on the minimum rate of interest, a weighting of the twelve-
(12)-month Euribor rate on each of the twelve (12) Reference Dates A corresponding to the 
Settlement Date of the Floating Rate A (said terms being deemed to be the Reference Date A 
falling on the fourteenth (14th) last calendar month prior to the Floating Rate A Settlement 
Date and the eleven (11) Reference Dates A following immediately after said Reference Date A) 
(as said weightings are stipulated in the Swap Contract Granada) and (ii) in the case of the 
Hedged Loans Granada for which the applicable rate is subject to six-monthly 
adjustments, a weighting of the twelve-(12)-month Euribor rate on each of the six (6) 
Reference Dates A corresponding to the Settlement Date of the Floating Rate A (said 
terms being deemed to be the Reference Date A falling on the eighth (8th) last 
calendar month prior to the Floating Rate A Settlement Date and the five (5) 
Reference Dates A following immediately after said Reference Date A) (as said 
weightings are stipulated in the Swap Contract Granada). On the second (2nd) last 
Business Day before each Payment Date, the Managing Company, acting on behalf of 
and representing the Fund, shall notify the Floating Floor Rate that is to apply to the 
Settlement Period that has ended three (3) Business Days earlier. 
166 


 
 
 
 
In the event that any of the Swap Contracts Granada were to be terminated early for 
a reason imputable to the Counterparty Entity, the settlement payment, should it be 
payable to the Counterparty Entity, shall be downgraded in the Payment Priority Order 
of the Fund to after the payment of interest and repayment of principal to the holders 
of the Securities, as well as the withholding of an amount sufficient to maintain the 
Amount Required for the Reserve Fund (this payment shall, therefore, come in 8th 
place in the Payment Priority Order provided for in section V.5.1.B).2). 
 
The Counterparty Entity shall undertake, and the Managing Company of the Fund 
shall ensure that said undertaking is fulfilled, that, in the event that at any time during 
the term of the Swap Contract Granada, the credit rating for its unsubordinated, 
unsecured, long-term debt were to be below A1 (MOODY'S), to choose between one 
or more of the following alternatives, depending on the rating given by the Rating 
Entity to the Counterparty Entity, within thirty (30) Business Days at the most as from 
the date on which said situation were notified, as long as the ratings given to the 
Securities by the Rating Agency are not affected: 
 
(i) make a deposit in cash or a deposit of securities for the benefit of the Fund as a 
guarantee for the performance of the contractual obligations entered into by the 
Counterparty Entity under the Swap Contract Granada, for an amount such that 
the rating given to the Securities by the Rating Agency shall not be downgraded; 
 
(ii) obtain a guarantee from a third entity that is rated at least A1 (MOODY'S) for its 
unsubordinated, unsecured, long-term debt, a guarantee that is sufficient to 
meet its contractual obligations, or else 
 
(iii) to assign its contractual position to a third-party entity, which shall be subrogated 
to replace the Counterparty Entity, or bring about that a third-party entity signs a 
new operation with the Fund, under terms that are substantially the same as the 
Swap Contract Granada, before terminating the contract, as long as the rating for 
the unsecured unsubordinated long-term debt of said third-party entity is at least 
A1 (MOODY's), in all of which the Managing Company shall act as the 
representative and for the account of the Fund, for the purpose of keeping the 
rating given to the Securities.  
 
Any failure on the part of the Counterparty Entity to fulfil the above obligation may 
lead to the credit ratings assigned to the Securities being withdrawn or downgraded 
by the Rating Agency and shall be deemed an early termination event for reasons 
imputable to the parties.  
 
All the costs, expenses and taxes incurred in order to comply with the above 
obligations shall be for the account of the Counterparty Entity. 
 
167 


 
 
 
The Swap Contract Granada shall expire on the earlier of the following dates: (i) 21 
March 2038 or, in the event that this date is not a Business Day, on the next Business

terminate the Fund in accordance with the terms of section III.8) hereof. 
 
V.4.4.2. Credifimo Swap Contract 
 
The Swap Contract Credifimo covers the risk arising from the Mortgage Loans 
assigned by CREDIFIMO (by issuing Mortgage Securities and Mortgage Transfer

The conditions set out in section V.4.4.1 hereabove for the Swap Contract Granada 
shall apply mutatis mutandis shall apply to the Swap Contract Credifimo, except for

Credifimo to the Nominal Amount multiplied by the number of days in the current 
Settlement Period and divided by 360. 
 
For said purposes, “Variable Rate B Credifimo" means, for each Settlement Period, 
the benchmark interest rate calculated in accordance with the terms of section 
II.10.1.c) hereof for the current Interest Accrual Period plus a spread of between 
seventeen (17) and twenty-four (24) basis points (0.17% and 0.24%, respectively) 
applied by the percentage represented on the first day of the Settlement Period by the 
Balance Outstanding on the Hedged Loans Credifimo over the Nominal Amount for 
said Settlement Period. The final spreads shall be set in the Swap Contract Credifimo. 
 
V.4.5 
Option Contracts

Fund, shall enter into two option contracts with one or more Spanish credit institutions 
(for the purposes hereof, each of which shall hereinafter be referred to as a 
"Counterparty Entity"), in accordance with the standard Outline Financial Operation 
Agreement (OFOA) of the Spanish Banking Association, one for the portfolio of CAJA 
GENERAL DE AHORROS DE GRANADA (the “Option Contract Granada”) and the 
other for the portfolio of UNIÓN DE CRÉDITO PARA LA FINANCIACIÓN MOBILIARIA E 
INMOBILIARIA, CREDIFIMO, E.F.C., S.A. (the “Option Contract Credifimo” and

168 


 
 
 
V.4.5.1 Option Contract Granada 
 
Under the terms of the Option Contract Granada, the Counterparty Entity must pay 
the Fund, on each Payment Date, the result of adding together, for each Settlement 
Period that ends on the last Calculation Date before said Payment Date, the amounts 
obtained by adding together, on each of the Settlement Dates for the Option included 
in said Settlement Period, the products of (i) and (ii) for each of the pools of Loans 
Benchmarked to the same Benchmark Index and for the same month. Where (i) is, for 
each Settlement Period, the balance outstanding of the pool of Loans Linked to the 
same Benchmark Index Granada and for the same month on the latest previous 
Option Settlement Date for which there are no amounts more than 90 days overdue 
on the current Option Settlement Date (including any Index-Linked Loans Granada 
that have been repaid during said period) (except for the first Settlement Period, 
which shall be the opening balance of the pool of Loans Linked to the Benchmark 
Rates Granada on the date the Fund is set up for which there are no amounts more 
than 90 days overdue on the first Option Settlement Date (including any Loans Linked 
to the Benchmark Rates Granada that have been repaid during said period)) and (ii) is 
the difference, whenever positive, between (a) the twelve-(12)-month Euribor set on 
the fifth (5th) last Business Day before the 21st day of the month the Benchmark Rate 
was set for the corresponding pool of loans plus forty-five (45) basis points (0.45%) 
and (b) the relevant Benchmark Rate for said month, multiplied by the number of day 
of the Option Settlement Period that ends on the corresponding Option Settlement 
Date, divided by 360. 
 
For the purposes of the previous paragraph, "Benchmark Index Granada Linked 
Loans" are the Assets assigned to the Fund by CAJA GENERAL DE AHORROS DE 
GRANADA to which the "Benchmark Indices" apply (these are the IRPH Entidades 
index, the IRPH Cajas index and the CECA index). 
 
The Option Contract Granada shall be divided up into successive Settlement Periods 
(which shall cover the same days as the Settlement Periods defined in section V.4.4 
for the Swap Contracts). Furthermore, each Settlement Period shall be divided up into 
"Option Settlement Periods", which shall include the days that effectively elapse 
between each Option Settlement Date, not including the first day and including the 
last day (except for the first Option Settlement Period, which shall cover the days 
elapsed as from, but not including the date the Fund is set up, up to and including 16 
May 2005). The "Option Settlement Dates" shall, for their part, fall on the fifth 
(5th) last Business Day before the 21st day of every month (the first Option 
Settlement Date shall be 16 May 2005). 
 
Under the terms of the Option Contract Granada, the Counterparty Entity must, in the 
event that at any time during the term of the Option Contract Granada, the credit 
rating for its unsubordinated, unsecured, long-term debt were to be below A1 
(MOODY'S), choose between one or more of the following alternatives, depending on 
the rating given by the Rating Entity to the Counterparty Entity, within thirty (30) 
Business Days at the most as from the date on which said situation were notified, as 
169 


 
 
 
long as the ratings given to the Securities by the Rating Entity are not affected: 
 
(i) 
make a deposit in cash or a deposit of securities for the benefit of the Fund as 
a guarantee for the performance of the contractual obligations entered into by 
the Counterparty Entity under the Option Contract Granada, for an amount 
such that the rating given to the Securities by the Rating Agency shall not be 
downgraded; 
 
(ii) 
obtain a guarantee from a third entity that is rated at least A1 (MOODY'S) for 
its unsubordinated, unsecured, long-term debt, which is sufficient to meet its 
contractual obligations, or else 
 
(iii) 
to assign its contractual position to a third-party entity, which shall be 
subrogated to replace the Counterparty Entity, or bring about that a third-
party entity signs a new option contract with the Fund, under terms that are 
substantially the same as the Option Contract Granada, before terminating 
the contract, as long as the rating for the unsecured unsubordinated long-
term debt of said third-party entity is at least A1 (MOODY's) and in all of 
which the Managing Company shall act as the representative and for the 
account of the Fund, for the purpose of keeping the ratings given to the 
Securities.  
 
Any failure on the part of the Counterparty Entity to fulfil the above obligation may 
lead to the credit ratings assigned to the Securities being withdrawn or downgraded 
by the Rating Agency and shall be deemed an early termination event for reasons 
imputable to the parties.  
 
All the costs, expenses and taxes incurred in order to comply with the above 
obligations shall be for the account of the Counterparty Entity. 
 
The Option Contract Granada shall expire on the earlier of the following dates: (i) 21 
March 2038 or, in the event that this date is not a Business Day, on the next Business 
Day thereafter (Legal Maturity Date) or (ii) (b) the date on which the Managing 
Company proceeds to terminate the Fund in accordance with the terms of section 
III.8) of the Prospectus. 
 
V.4.5.2 Option Contract Credifimo 
 
The same terms, mutatis mutandis, shall apply to the Option Contract Credifimo as set 
out in section V.4.5.1 hereabove for the Option Contract Granada, except for the 
hedged loans, which in the case of the Option Contract Credifimo shall be those assets 
assigned to the Fund by UNIÓN DE CRÉDITO PARA LA FINANCIACIÓN MOBILIARIA E 
INMOBILIARIA, CREDIFIMO, E.F.C., S.A., which are subject to the Benchmark Indices

VII.1 
Latest significant trends in the mortgage market in general and, in 
particular, in the market for mortgage loans, concerning the rules of the 
market, and the trend in interest rates, and the rates of early repayments 
and non-performance 
 
The Spanish mortgage market has undergone major changes in recent years in both 
its governing law and the predominance of the interest given to it by credit 
institutions. 
 
The aim of the latest rules has been to give mortgagors greater powers for 
negotiating the loans, as well as to bring down certain costs linked to negotiating 
mortgage loans. In this regard, in addition to the Subrogation and Modification of 
Mortgage Loans Act, Law 2/1994, dated 30 March, (which lays down the rules 
governing the scope for replacing and renegotiating the financial terms of the loans 
and reducing tax costs and duties, as well as reducing the charges for early 
repayment for floating-interest loans), two measures were adopted aimed at bringing 
down the costs of operations to subrogate and renew modified mortgage loans: on 
the one hand, the agreement signed by the Ministry of the Economy with banks and 
savings banks, bringing down charges; and on the other, the enactment of Royal 
Decree 2616/1996, dated 20 December, and Royal Decree Law 2/2003, dated 25 
April, regarding measures of economic reform (subsequently processed as a Bill and 
enacted as the Measures of Economic Reform Act, Law 36/2003, dated 11 November) 
which, inter alia, modify the fees of notaries and registers for operations to subrogate 
and renew mortgage loans governed by the aforementioned Law 36/1994. 
 
Furthermore, the plummeting of interest rates in recent years, together with an 
increase in competition between the credit institutions in this segment of finance, 
because of its strategic character as regards customer loyalty, has meant that there 
has been a major increase in the rates of early repayment for mortgage loans with 
interest rates that were higher than the rates prevailing in the mortgage market at the 
time, whenever the lenders failed to provide for a renegotiation of the financial terms. 
 
It should, therefore, be borne in mind that, in any case, mortgage loans are going to 
be repaid early regardless of the Subrogation and Modification of Mortgage Loans Act 
179 


 
 
 
referred to above, because the possibility or opportunity for doing so will be caused 
not only by the facilities granted under the Act, but rather by more determining 
factors, such as, fundamentally, the seasoning and the fact that the rate of interest on 
loans is higher than the rates currently being offered. 
 
VII.2 
Likely implications of the trends referred to in the previous point VII.1 (rate 
of early repayments, rate of non-performing loans, etc.) 
 
Part of the Mortgage Loans securitised by the Mortgage Securities and Certificates 
subscribed by the Fund are floating interest rate, and adjust regularly to changes in 
market interest rates; a high level of early repayment is therefore not to be expected 
on the Mortgage Loans. 
 
As for the credit solvency of the Debtors, none of the Mortgage Loans that make up 
the provisional portfolio and which will be used for the issue of the Mortgage 
Securities and Certificates are any payments more than 30 days overdue. This 
situation has been checked, as recorded in the audit report attached as Appendix IV 
to the Prospectus.
