The above tables are the result of the hypothesis included in section 2.12 of this Prospectus. 
“Pass-through” is a term commonly accepted by the market to indicate that the amortisation of the 
Bonds occurs through a controlled payment schedule, and related to the amortisation of the assets 
which back the Bonds. Nevertheless, the exact terms of the amortisation conditions are in section 
2.11. of the Prospectus.  


This prospectus is a translation into English of the original "Folleto Informativo" drafted in Spanish language and registered with the 
"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores" (the Spanish Securities Market Commission, "CNMV") on February 26th, 2004. The 
"Folleto Informativo" drafted in the Spanish language is the only official document, and no document other than the "Folleto 
Informativo"shall have any legal effect or be relied upon with regard to the Note Issue. 
 
3.1. Amount, price and interest rate of the Bonds 
The amount of the issue is 600,000,000 Euros, and is constituted by 6,000 Bonds in four Series, 
represented as book entries, with a nominal value of 100,000 Euros. The price of issue of each Bond 
will be 100,000 Euros, 100% of its nominal value.  
Series A consists of 5,673 Bonds, that accrue at an annual variable interest rate, paid quarterly on 
each Payment Date, resulting of the sum of (i) the 3-month EURIBOR interest rate, established in 
section 2.10.1. of the Prospectus, plus (ii) a margin set between 0.18% and 0.23%, both inclusive. 
Series B consists of 192 Bonds, that accrue at an annual variable interest rate, paid quarterly on each 
Payment Date, resulting of the sum of (i) the 3-month EURIBOR interest rate, established in section 
2.10.1. of the Prospectus, plus (ii) a margin set between 0.50% and 0.65%, both inclusive. 
Series C consists of 60 Bonds, that accrue at an annual variable interest rate, paid quarterly on each 
Payment Date, resulting of the sum of (i) the 3-month EURIBOR interest rate, established in section 
2.10.1. of the Prospectus, plus (ii) a margin set between 1% and 1.20%, both inclusive. 
Series D consists of 75 Bonds, that accrue at an annual variable interest rate, paid quarterly on each 
Payment Date, resulting of the sum of (i) the 3-month EURIBOR interest rate, established in section 
2.10.1. of the Prospectus, plus (ii) a margin set between 3% and 3.75%, both inclusive. 
In each case payment of interest will take place every quarter, and will be calculated on the basis of 
actual number of days elapsed and a 360 day year. 
The margin to be applied to the Bonds, in percentages, will be determined by common agreement 
between the Placements Directors, no later than 11:00 am (CET) on March 1st, 2004. The final 
applicable margin for the Bonds of all Series will be faxed to the Sociedad Gestora, before 11:30 am 
(CET) on March 1st, 2004 by the Placements Directors. In absence of this notification, the Sociedad 
Gestora will set the margin for the A Bonds in 0.23%, for the B Bonds in 0.60%, for the C Bonds in 
1.10%, and for the D Bonds in 3.50%. Also, at the same date, the Sociedad Gestora will notify the 
CNMV as additional information to this Prospectus. The final margin will be certified in the closing 
deed. 
Interest for Delayed Payment: in case of non-payment to the Bondholders, the amounts matured 
but not yet distributed will not accrue penalty interests. 
3.2. Amortisation of the Bonds. 
The redemption value of each Bond will be 100,000 Euros equivalent to its nominal value. 
Bonds of Series A will follow the pace of amortisation of the Mortgage Loans, such amortisation will 
be transferred on a quarterly basis, in the terms established in section 2.11.2. of this Prospectus; 
amortisation of Series B will begin once the compromises of the amortisation of Series A; the 
amortisation of Series C will begin once Series B is fully amortised; and the amortisation of Series D 
will begin once the Series C is fully amortised. 
Notwithstanding, A, B, C and D Bonds will be amortised pro rata in proportion to the 
Outstanding Nominal Balance of each Bond, without the need for the previous Series to be fully 
amortised, in the amounts resulting from the application of (a) and (b) of section II.11.2., and 
whenever there are sufficient resources to do so, in accordance with section V.4.2. of this 
Prospectus and the difference of application of (a) of section II.11.2., is equal to zero, when on a 
Payment Date, the credit enhancement of the subordinated classes, that is, the relationship

"Folleto Informativo" drafted in the Spanish language is the only official document, and no document other than the "Folleto 
Informativo"shall have any legal effect or be relied upon with regard to the Note Issue. 
 
between the Outstanding Nominal Balance of the B, C and D Bonds jointly, and the Outstanding 
Nominal Balance of all the Bonds represent twice the relationship between the Outstanding 
Nominal Balance of the B, C and D Bonds jointly, and the Outstanding Nominal Balance of all 
the Bonds on the date of the constitution of the Fund. 
The amortisation of all Series of Bonds will resume the procedure of section II.11.2. above, when 
on a Payment Date, one of the following situations takes place: 
(i) the Reserve Fund does not cover the Minimum Level established in section V.3.4. of this 
Prospectus. 
(ii) in the event that the Sociedad Gestora does not proceed to the early liquidation of the Fund 
when the Outstanding Nominal Balance of the Shares and Certificates is below 10% of its Initial 
Balance. 
Additionally, the amortisation of each Series on an individual basis will: 
(i) cease to be on a pro rata basis for Series B Bonds when the Outstanding Nominal Balance 
of the non-defaulted Shares and Certificates, with non-payments above 90 days, is equal or 
higher than 1.5% of the Outstanding Nominal Balance of all the Bonds on the date of their 
constitution, therefore only A Bonds will be on a pro rata basis. This amortisation will return 
to the pro rata basis when the Outstanding Nominal Balance of the non-defaulted Shares and 
Certificates, with non-payments above 90 days falls again below 1.5% but higher than 1% of 
the Outstanding Nominal Balance of all the Bonds on the date of their constitution, therefore 
only A and B Bonds will be on a pro rata basis. 
(ii) cease to be on a pro rata basis for Series C Bonds when the Outstanding Nominal 
Balance of the non-defaulted Shares and Certificates, with non-payments above 90 days, is 
equal or higher than 1% of the Outstanding Nominal Balance of all the Bonds on the date of 
their constitution, therefore only A and B Bonds will be on a pro rata basis. This 
amortisation will return to the pro rata basis when the Outstanding Nominal Balance of the 
non-defaulted Shares and Certificates, with non-payments above 90 days falls again below 
1% of the Outstanding Nominal Balance of all the Bonds on the date of their constitution, 
therefore only A, B and C Bonds will be on a pro rata basis. 
(iii) irreversibly cease to be on a pro rata basis for Series D Bonds, when the Outstanding 
Nominal Balance of the non-defaulted Shares and Certificates, with non-payments above 90 
days, is equal or higher than 0.5% of the Outstanding Nominal Balance of all the Bonds on 
the date of their constitution, therefore only A, B and C Bonds will be on a pro rata basis. 
In the event of the anticipated liquidation of the Fund as described in section 3.10. of this Prospectus, 
and considering the proportion of B, C and D Bonds in relation to the total issue of the Bonds, the 
amortisation of the Bonds of the B, C and D Series will take place in one payment only on the date of 
the liquidation of the Fund.  
3.3. Maturity of the Bonds. 
Bonds will be considered matured on the date in which they are totally amortised or on the date of 
Liquidation of the Fund. 
The final date of amortisation of the Mortgage Loans grouped in the portfolio will be December 12th, 
2033.

9.Early Liquidation of the Fund (call) and extinction of the Fund 
By virtue of the Fund Regulations and in this Prospectus, the Sociedad Gestora is entitled to proceed 
to the early liquidation of the Fund TDA 19-MIXTO when the remaining Balance of the Shares and 
Certificates is less than 10% of the initial amount, provided that the proceeds of the liquidation of the 
assets permits the discharge of the outstanding obligations to the Bond holders, in accordance with 
the priority order established in section 5.4. of this Prospectus, and provided that the necessary 
authorisations have been obtained from the relevant authorities. The Fund will be extinguished, in 
any event, in the following situations, following notification to the CNMV and the Rating Agencies: 
 
When the Shares and Certificates are fully amortised, included the event described in section 3.6. of 
this Prospectus for the modification of the tax regime and the Seller’s option to repurchase the entire 
amount of Shares and Certificates remaining in the Fund is effected, in accordance with said section. 
In the event that all the Shares and Certificates have matured and there remain amounts to be 
collected from said Shares and Certificates and payments to the Bondholders, the Fund will be 
extinguished on the Payment Date immediately following the 2 years after the maturity of the last 
Mortgage Loan grouped in the Fund, that is March 22nd, 2036. 
If the Sellers exercise their right to repurchase all the Shares and Certificates which remain in the 
Fund, in accordance with section 3.6, the repurchase must coincide with a Transfer Date and will 
imply the early amortisation of the Bonds on the Payment Date following the date in which the 
payment of the Shares and Certificates repurchased, takes place. 
When the Bonds issued are fully amortised. 
When, in the opinion of the Sociedad Gestora, exceptional circumstances concur that render 
impossible, or extremely difficult, the maintenance of the financial balance of the Fund. In this case, 
the Sociedad Gestora, as soon as the CNMV has been informed, will proceed to liquidate the Fund in 
accordance with the priority order described in section 5.4.2. of this Prospectus. 
In the event described in Article 19 of Royal Decree 926/1998, which establishes the obligation to 
liquidate four months after the forced replacement of the Sociedad Gestora, due to receivership or 
bankruptcy, when no other Sociedad Gestora has been found to take over the management of the 
Fund. 
When non-payment of any of the values issued takes place, indicative of a serious and permanent 
unbalance, or it is expected to happen. In this case, the Sociedad Gestora, once the CNMV has been 
informed, will proceed to liquidate the Fund in accordance with the priority order described in 
section 5.4.2. of this Prospectus. 
If the provisional ratings granted to the Bonds by the Rating Agencies are not confirmed prior to the 
Subscription Period of the Bonds, the Fund, the issue and subscription of the Shares and Certificates,

parties and in any legal proceeding, in accordance with the law.

This Prospectus has been recorded in the Official Register of the Comisión Nacional del Mercado de 
Valores on February 26th, 2004.

I.3

Caixa Tarragona, in accordance with Article 5 of Royal Decree 926/1998 of May 14th. Said Audit Report

CHAPTER I – Persons assuming responsibility for the contents of the Prospectus 
This prospectus is a translation into English of the original "Folleto Informativo" drafted in Spanish language and registered with the 
"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores" (the Spanish Securities Market Commission, "CNMV") on February 24, 2004. The "Folleto 
Informativo" drafted in the Spanish language is the only official document, and no document other than the "Folleto Informativo" shall have 
any legal effect or be relied upon with regard to the Note Issue.

Said Report has been elaborated from a selection of mortgage loans extracted from the 7,929 mortgage 
loans with a balance, on January 21st, 2004, of 631,157,039.66 Euros, which integrate the portfolio; and 
has been made using sampling techniques that constitute a commonly accepted procedure to verify the 
registers held at entities in relation to a group of items (“population”), and allow the inference of said 
population by an analysis of a number of items (“sample”) smaller than the total group. The level of 
confidence indicates the probability that the real number of items with deviations from an existing trend 
of population does not exceed a predetermined limit (“precision”). The size of the sample and the 
confidence level chosen determine that, in the event of errors not being found in the sample, a maximum 
error level is inferred for the population, always different from zero. 
In the event that new errors are detected in the rest of the population which have not been initially 
detected by the auditors for the rest of the population not included in the sample, the corresponding 
Shares and Certificates shall be replaced in accordance with section IV.1.  
The Sociedad Gestora declares that all the Mortgage Loans backing Shares and Certificates grouped in 
the Fund TDA 19-MIXTO, both in the initial al final selection to be made on the Closing Date, their 
characteristics described in section IV.4. of this Prospectus, have been selected from the portfolios to 
which the audit report applies.

Evaluation of the Inherent Risk of the Bonds 
The Sociedad Gestora in its capacity as founder and legal representative of the Fund, and the Sellers, in

Rating provided by Rating Agencies to D Series means that this Series is not investment grade, as 
detailed in Anex 3. 
The Rating Agencies were commissioned to perform an evaluation of the Bonds and provide the rating 
thereof. 
The rating, by definition, constitutes the opinion of the Agencies as to the level of credit risk (late 
payment and default) to which the Bonds are subject. Accordingly, this involves an assessment of the 
likelihood that Bondholders will receive payments of interest due to them on the expected dates.  
Fitch's rating of the credit risk is an opinion on the capacity of the Bonds to comply with interest and 
principal payments throughout the life of the transaction. 
Fitch's ratings for long and short term debt are the following: 
Long Term  
 
Short Term 
AAA  
 
F1+ 
AA 
 
F1 
A  
 
F2 
BBB  
 
F3 
BB  
 
 
B  
 
 
CCC, CC, C 
 
 
DDD, DD, D 
 
 
Fitch applies modifiers + and - to indicate the relative position of a rating within the main rating 
categories. These modifiers are not added, among long term ratings, to AAA or CCC or below, neither to 
short term ratings other than F1. 
Fitch's rating is based on the quality of the Shares and Certificates grouped in the Fund, in the available 
credit enhancements and the legal and financial aspects of the issue of the Bonds. 
The ratings assigned to each Series by Fitch measure the capacity of the Fund to comply with the 
payment of interest on each expected Payment Date and the reimbursement of principal during the life of 
the transaction, and in any event, before the Final Maturity Date, as established in the documents. The 
documents allow the delay of interest payment of Classes B, C and D under certain circumstances. This 
implies that interest might not be received from these bonds during a certain period of time if the delay 
trigger is reached and without causing the lack of payment of the bonds. The rating does not in any way 
imply an assessment of the likely yield of the Bonds. 


CHAPTER II – Information Relating to the securities issued 
This prospectus is a translation into English of the original "Folleto Informativo" drafted in Spanish language and registered with the 
"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores" (the Spanish Securities Market Commission, "CNMV") on February 26th, 2004. The "Folleto 
Informativo" drafted in the Spanish language is the only official document, and no document other than the "Folleto Informativo" shall have 
any legal effect or be relied upon with regard to the Note Issue.

In order to make its assessment, Fitch has relied upon the statements made by the participants in the 
transaction, by its auditors and lawyers, and by other experts concerning the accuracy and completeness 
of the information provided in connection with the rating and its subsequent monitoring. 
The rating assigned by Fitch upon the creation of the Fund is subject to revision, suspension or 
withdrawal at any time, on the basis of any information of which it becomes aware, or the lack of 
available information, or any other reason. 
The rating assigned by Fitch does not constitute a recommendation to buy, retain or sell the Bonds.  
Moody's assessment takes into account the structure of the transaction, the legal aspects of the Bonds, the 
characteristics of the issuing Fund, the nature and characteristics of the Mortgage Loans and the regularity 
and continuity of the flow of funds in the operation. 
The rating assigned by Moody's does not constitute an assessment of the probability that the debtors will 
prepay or amortise the principal, nor is it an assessment of the extent to which such payments may differ 
from the original expectations. The rating does not in any way imply an assessment of the likely yield of 
the Bonds. 
Moody's ratings for long and short term issues of debt are as follows: 
 
Long Term 
 
Short Term 
Aaa  
 
Prime-1 
Aa  
 
Prime-2 
A  
 
Prime-3 
Baa  
 
Not Prime 
Ba 
 
 
B 
 
 
Caa 
 
 
Ca 
 
 
C 
 
 
 
Moody's applies the numerical modifiers 1, 2 and 3 to each long term rating category between Aa and B. 
Modifier 1 indicates values in the higher range of the rating category, modifier 2 indicates medium range 
and modifier 3 indicates the lower range of each generic category. 
Moody's rating for this transaction measures the expected loss before the Legal Maturity Date of the 
Fund. 
Moody’s rating for this transaction is an opinion on the capacity of the Fund to promptly pay interest and 
principal during the life of the transaction, and in any case, before its legal termination, on March 22nd, 
2036. 
In order to make its assessment, Moody's has relied upon the statements made by the participants in the 
transaction, by its auditors and lawyers, and by other experts concerning the accuracy and completeness 
of the information provided in connection with the rating and its subsequent monitoring. 
 


CHAPTER II – Information Relating to the securities issued 
This prospectus is a translation into English of the original "Folleto Informativo" drafted in Spanish language and registered with the 
"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores" (the Spanish Securities Market Commission, "CNMV") on February 26th, 2004. The "Folleto

The rating assigned by Moody's upon the creation of the Fund is subject to revision, suspension or 
withdrawal at any time, on the basis of any information of which it becomes aware. The initial rating, as 
well as any revision or suspension: 
- 
Is formulated by Moody's on the basis of a considerable amount of information received, and in 
respect of which Moody's gives no assurance as regards accuracy or completeness so that Moody's 
shall not in manner be considered liable. 
- 
Does not constitute and cannot, accordingly, be interpreted in any manner as a recommendation or 
encouragement to Bondholders to proceed to effect any transaction in respect of the Bonds, and in 
particular, to buy, hold, retain, pledge or sell the Bonds.  
- 
And neither reflects the market conditions, or the possible needs of any particular investor. 
The absence of confirmation prior to the beginning of the subscription period of the provisional ratings 
assigned to each Series of Bonds (A, B, C and D) by the Rating Agencies, will constitute grounds for the 
dissolution of the Fund, the Initial Expenses Loan, the Subordinated and Participative Loans, the Swap 
Contract and the issue of the Bonds. 
The documents in which the Rating Agencies grant the rating to this issue are included as Annex 3 of this 
Prospectus.  
II.4 
Nature and Name of the Bonds Issued 
The aggregate amount of the issue is 600,000,000 Euros, divided into 6,000 Bonds of four Series (A, B, C 
and D).

The Bonds are regulated by Royal Decree 926/1998, benefiting from their nature as fixed income 
securities that are homogeneous, standardised, and therefore negotiable in organised security markets. 
II.4.1. 
Different Periodicity between the Flow of Income and Payments of the Fund. 
The financial service of the Bonds is effected from the flow of income of the Shares and Certificates. 
The Fund receives such income on a daily basis from Cajamar and weekly from Caixa Tarragona, 
and makes its payments on a quarterly basis, such income being invested in the Fund’s Account, 
Transfer Account and Reinvestment Accounts during the interim between inflow and outflow, as 
specified in section V.3.5. of this Prospectus. Global protection mechanisms are available, which 
cover up to a certain limit the risk of insufficiency of resources of the Fund and which have been 
taken into consideration by the Rating Agencies for the purpose of assigning the rating to the issue 
described in section II.3. of this Prospectus. 


CHAPTER II – Information Relating to the securities issued 
This prospectus is a translation into English of the original "Folleto Informativo" drafted in Spanish language and registered with the 
"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores" (the Spanish Securities Market Commission, "CNMV") on February 26th, 2004. The "Folleto 
Informativo" drafted in the Spanish language is the only official document, and no document other than the "Folleto Informativo" shall have 
any legal effect or be relied upon with regard to the Note Issue.

II.4.2. 
Priority of Payments. 
With respect to the payment of interest and principal of the Bonds, the Bondholders are subject to the 
priority of payments of the Fund as described in section V.4.2. of this Prospectus. 
II.4.3. 
Other Risk Considerations. 
II.4.3.1. 
Risk of non-payment of the Mortgage Share Certificates and the 
Mortgage Transfer Certificates. 
Bondholders shall bear the risk of non-payment of the Shares and Certificates grouped in the Fund, 
taking into account the protection granted by the credit enhancement mechanisms. 
The Sellers will not assume any liability whatsoever for the non-payment by the Mortgage debtors, of 
either principal, interest or any other amount that may be due by virtue of the Mortgage Loans. Nor do 
they, under any other form whatsoever, assume any responsibility in guaranteeing, either directly or 
indirectly, the final success of the operation or give guarantees or warranties, nor enter into repurchase 
agreements for the Shares and Certificates, neither by virtue of the Fund Regulations or any other pact 
or contract. All of the above without prejudice to the responsibilities of the Sellers in respect of the 
Loan Contracts (Initial Expenses Loan, Subordinated Loan and Participative Loan), Swap Contract, 
and by the compromise described in Clauses 9 and 10 of the Fund Regulations and described in 
section IV.2. of this Prospectus. 
II.4.3.2. 
Risk of prepayment of the Mortgage Share Certificates and the 
Mortgage Transfer Certificates. 
The Shares and Certificates grouped in the Fund may be subject to prepayment when the borrowers of 
the underlying Mortgage Loans reimburse the outstanding capital. 
The risk entailed by said prepayment will be transferred quarterly, on each Payment Date, to the 
Bondholders in accordance with the rules of amortisation described in section II.11. of this 
Prospectus. 
II.4.3.3. 
Other Considerations 
Limited Protection: An investment in the Bonds may be affected, among other things, by a downturn 
in general economic conditions which may adversely affect the payments of the Mortgage Loans 
which support the Fund. Sufficiently high defaults could reduce, or even eliminate, the protection of 
the Bonds against losses in the Loan portfolio, which is provided by the existence of the credit 
enhancements described in section V.3. of this Prospectus. 
Limited Responsibility: The Bonds issued by the Fund do not represent an obligation of the 
Sociedad Gestora or of the Sellers. The flow of resources to cover payment obligations arising from 
the Bonds is insured or guaranteed only on the specific circumstance and to the limited extent cited in 
this Prospectus. With the exception of these guarantees, no other guarantees are granted by any public 
or private entity, including the Sellers, the Sociedad Gestora, or any other company affiliated to these 
entities, or in which they have holdings. The Shares and Certificates representing the Loans and rights 
they entail constitute the sole source of income for the Fund and, therefore, the sole source of 
payments to the Bondholders. 


CHAPTER II – Information Relating to the securities issued 
This prospectus is a translation into English of the original "Folleto Informativo" drafted in Spanish language and registered with the 
"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores" (the Spanish Securities Market Commission, "CNMV") on February 26th, 2004. The "Folleto 
Informativo" drafted in the Spanish language is the only official document, and no document other than the "Folleto Informativo" shall have 
any legal effect or be relied upon with regard to the Note Issue. 
 
8 
Limited Liquidity: There is no guarantee that a secondary market with a minimum frequency and 
liquidity will develop. 
In addition, in no case may the Bonds be repurchased by the Fund from the holders, although early 
amortisation of the Bonds in their entirety is possible, in the event of the early liquidation of the Fund,  
when the outstanding Balance of the Shares plus the Certificates, is less than 10% of the initial 
balance of all the Shares and Certificates, under the terms set out in section III.10. of this Prospectus. 
Yield: The rate of prepayment of the Loans may be influenced by a variety of geographic, economic 
and social factors, such as the age of the debtors, seasonality, market interest rates and unemployment. 
The calculation of the yield, average life and duration of the Bonds involves assumptions regarding 
prepayment rates that may not occur. 
Additional Interest: The existence of delays in the payment of interest or principal to the 
Bondholders shall in no case result in additional interest in their favour. 
Legal Aspects: As of the Date of Issue of the Bonds, the Sellers have granted a Series of warranties 
and guarantees on the characteristics of the Loans and the Shares and Certificates concerning the 
existence of the Loans and any guarantees relating thereto, if any, as well as the absence of any 
obstacle to the issue of the Shares and Certificates, and their conformity with the characteristics of the 
Loans set out in the Regulations and in this Prospectus. However, the Sellers do not guarantee the 
solvency of the debtors of the Loans. In addition, such guarantees do not enable Bondholders to 
exercise against the Sellers any rights, which they may have against the Fund; the Sociedad Gestora is 
the only authorised representative of the Bondholders in relation with third parties and in any legal 
proceedings related to the Fund TDA 19-MIXTO in accordance with article 12 (1) of Royal Decree 
926/1998 and in article 6 paragraph 2 of Law 19/1992. 
In accordance with the Fund Regulations and this Prospectus, the Sellers have undertaken to act, as 
regards the servicing of the shared Loans, using the same care as when dealing with any other Loan in 
their portfolio. 
II.5 
Form and Representation and Accounting Registry 
The Bonds will be represented as book entries, in accordance with Royal Decree 926/1998 and they will 
be constituted as such by virtue of their inscription in the corresponding accounting registry.  
The Bondholders shall be identified as such (on their behalf or through third parties) in the registry 
maintained by IBERCLEAR or the entity which substitutes it, which will be responsible for maintaining 
the accounting registry of the Bonds in accordance with the Fund Regulations, in such a way that the 
clearing and payments of the Bonds is effected in accordance with the rules established in the AIAF 
Market or that may be established in the future by IBERCLEAR, or the entity which substitutes it, for 
securities admitted to listing and represented as book entries.  
II.6 
Amount of the Issue, in Nominal Euros, Number of Bonds and Amount of Each Bond. 
The aggregate amount of the issue of Bonds will be 600,000,000 Euros; the Bonds will be represented as 
book entries each with a nominal value of 100,000 Euros. 6,000 Bonds in four Series will be issued.

II.8 
Commissions and Related Expenses required to be borne by Investors when 
Subscribing for the Securities Issued by the Fund. 
The aforementioned price of issue shall be free of taxes and subscription expenses for the investor. 
II.9 
Commissions to be charged to Bondholders. 
Commissions of registry in IBERCLEAR’s Main Register will be charged to the Sociedad Gestora, it 
will be non-transferable and there will not be a commission in concept of balance maintenance. 
Furthermore, entities associated to IBERCLEAR will be able to establish, in accordance with current 
legislation, the commissions and expenses transferable to the holder of the Bonds for the concept of 
security administration they determine, notifying the Bank of Spain and/or to the CNMV as supervising 
body. 
II.10 
Interest of the Bonds. 
II.10.1. 
Nominal Interest. 
Interest payments to the Bondholders will be made, in relation to the rest of the payments of the Fund, 
according to the priority order described in section V.4.2. of this Prospectus. Interest for all classes 
will accrue on the basis of Interest Accrual Periods. Each Interest Accrual Period will be the period 
between two consecutive Payment Dates, including the first and excluding the last. The first accrual 
period will start on the Closing Date (including that date) and will end on the first Payment Date, June 
22nd, 2004 (excluding that date). 
All the Bonds issued will bear, from the Closing Date until their final maturity, a variable annual 
interest rate, paid quarterly on each Payment Date on the Outstanding Nominal Balance of each Bond.  
The applicable interest rate for each one of the Series of Bonds during each Accrual Period will be the 
sum of (i) the Reference Interest Rate, determined as established in the following section, equal for all 
Series of Bonds and rounded to the nearest thousandth of a percentage point, taking into account that, 
in the case that the proximity for the rounding up or down is identical, such rounding will be effected 
upwards, plus (ii) the margin applicable to each Series of Bonds, as is established below. 
Reference Interest Rate: The Reference Interest Rate for the determination of the applicable interest 
rate for the Bonds of all Series will be the 3-month EURIBOR, or a substitute if necessary, and will be 
determined as follows. EURIBOR is the market’s reference interest rate for the Euro.

any legal effect or be relied upon with regard to the Note Issue. 
 
10 
Notwithstanding, Reference Interest Rate for the first Accrual Period, between the Closing Date and 
the first Payment Date, will be the result of the lineal interpolation between 3-month EURIBOR rate 
and 4-month EURIBOR rate, taking account the number of days of the first Accrual Period. 
Calculation of the Reference Interest Rate for the first Accrual Period will result according with the 
following formula: 
R = E3+((d-91)/30)*(E4-E3) 
R= 
Reference Interest Rate for the first Accrual Period. 
d= 
Number of days for the first Accrual Period. 
E3= 3-month EURIBOR rate. 
E4= 4-month EURIBOR rate. 
Determination of the Reference Interest Rate for the Bonds: The determination of EURIBOR will 
conform to the rules described in this section. 
On each Determination Date, the Sociedad Gestora will determine the Reference Interest Rate equal 
to the EURIBOR, as follows:  
(i) 
The 3-month EURIBOR rate which appears on the REUTERS’ screen, EURIBOR= page at 
11:00 am C.E.T. (Central European Time) of the Determination Date. “REUTERS’ screen, 
EURIBOR= page" is the page that reflects the contents of page "EURIBOR=" on the 
REUTERS MONITOR MONEY RATES SERVICE (or any other page that might replace it in 
this service). 
 
(ii) 
In absence of the rates indicated in part (i) the average shall be that of the 3-month EURIBOR 
rate on the Determination Date which appears on “TELERATE” screen (TELERATE SPAIN, 
S.A.), page 248, (or any other page that might replace it in this service) at 11:00 am C.E.T.. 
(iii) 
In absence of the rates indicated in parts (i) and (ii) the average shall be that of the London 3-
month interbank interest rates for Euro-denominated deposit operations declared, 
simultaneously, on the Determination Date by the following institutions: 
- 
Banco Santander Central Hispano (London office) 
- 
JP Morgan Chase & Co. (London) 
- 
Barclays Bank (London) 
- 
Confederación Española de Cajas de Ahorros (London office) 
In the event that one of the above institutions does not supply quotes, the applicable rate shall 
be the average of the rates declared by at least two of the remaining institutions.  
(iv) 
In the event that the rates cannot be determined by the above mentioned procedures (i), (ii), and 
(iii), the applicable rate shall be that which was applicable for the previous Interest Accrual 
Period. 
The Sociedad Gestora will keep copy of REUTERS or TELERATE´s pages, or in its case, the 
supplied quotes of the institutions mentioned in part (iii), as documentation of the type of EURIBOR 
established.

Determination Date of the Reference Interest Rate and the Interest Rate of the Bonds: The 
Determination Date for the Reference Interest Rate for each accrual period will be the second 
Business Day before the Payment Date which marks the start of the corresponding accrual period. For 
the first Interest Accrual Period the Reference Interest Rate will be determined on March 1st, 2004. 
Once the Reference Interest Rate for the Bonds has been determined, and on the same Determination 
Date, the Sociedad Gestora will calculate and determine for each Series of Bond the applicable 
interest rate for the following accrual period. 
Margin to be applied to the Interest Rate for each one of the Series of Bonds: 
The margin to be applied to the Interest Rate, determined in the previous paragraph, to calculate the 
interest rate to be accrued during each interest period by the A Bonds will be between 0.18% and 
0.23% both inclusive. 
The margin to be applied to the Interest Rate, determined in the previous paragraph, to calculate the 
interest rate to be accrued during each interest period by the B Bonds will be between 0.50% and 
0.65% both inclusive. 
The margin to be applied to the Interest Rate, determined in the previous paragraph, to calculate the 
interest rate to be accrued during each interest period by the C Bonds will be between 1% and 1.20% 
both inclusive. 
The margin to be applied to the Interest Rate, determined in the previous paragraph, to calculate the 
interest rate to be accrued during each interest period by the D Bonds will be between 3% and 3.75% 
both inclusive. 
The margin to be applied to the Bonds, in percentages, will be determined by agreement between the Placement Directors, no later 
than 11 am (CET) on March 1, 2004. The final margin to be applied to the Bonds of all Series will be faxed to the Sociedad 
Gestora before 11.30 am (CET) on March 1, 2004 by the Placement Directors. In the absence of this notification, the Sociedad 
Gestora will establish the margin of Series A in 0.23%, Series B in 0.60%, Series C in 1.10% and Series D in 3.50%. Furthermore, 
on this same date, the Sociedad Gestora will also notify the CNMV as additional information to this Prospectus. The final margin 
to be applied will be included in the closing deed. 
Formula to calculate the interest of the Bonds: Interest accrued by the Bonds of all Series for each 
accrual period will be calculated by the Sociedad Gestora according to the following formula:

II.10.2. 
Dates, Place and Procedure for the Payment of Interest 
Interest payments on the Bonds of all Series will be made quarterly on March, June, September and 
December 22nd of every year until the Bonds are completely amortised. In the case that one of such 
days is not a Business Day in Madrid - as set by the Central European Bank for the functioning of the 
TARGET system expect those days that, even though a business day according to TARGET, the 
interest for the quarter will be paid on the following Business Day. 
In the event that on a Payment Date, and despite de mechanisms established for the protection of the 
rights of the Bondholders, the Available Resources (defined further on) are not sufficient to comply 
with all of the payment obligations of the Fund as specified in section V.4.2. of this Prospectus, the 
amount available for the payment of interest will be distributed in accordance with the priority of 
allocations established in such section. In the case that the Available Resources are only sufficient to 
comply partially with obligations with the same priority of allocation, independently for each one, the 
amount available will be divided proportionately among the Bonds affected in proportion with their 
Outstanding Balances. The amounts not received by Bondholders on such date will be deemed as 
pending payment and will be paid on the following Payment Date in which such payment is possible, 
without accruing additional interest. Amounts due but not paid to the Bondholders will be paid on the 
following Payment Date (if possible), with priority immediately before the payments due to the 
Bondholders of that same Series, for the corresponding period. The priority of allocation of payments 
is set out in section V.4.2. of this Prospectus. 
Withholding and other taxes, as well as any taxes that may be imposed in the future on the capital, 
interest, or returns of the Bonds will be the exclusive responsibility of the Bondholders and such 
amounts will be deducted, as appropriate, by the designated entity in the form legally established. 
Payment will be made through the Paying Agent (Banco Santander Central Hispano), and distributed 
through the IBERCLEAR, or the entity that substitutes it, and associated entities. 
II.11 
Amortisation of the Bonds. 
II.11.1. 
Redemption Price  
The redemption value of each Bond will be 100,000 Euros, equivalent to its nominal value, free of 
expenses and taxes for the holder, to be paid progressively on every Payment Date as is established in 
the following sections. 
II.11.2. 
Amortisation of the Bonds 
The amortisation of A, B, C and D Bonds will take place, on each Payment Date, pro rata among the 
Bonds of the Series to be amortised (in accordance with the following), through a reduction of the 
nominal amount, until said nominal amount is completed, for an amount equal to the lowest of the 
following amounts: 


CHAPTER II – Information Relating to the securities issued 
This prospectus is a translation into English of the original "Folleto Informativo" drafted in Spanish language and registered with the 
"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores" (the Spanish Securities Market Commission, "CNMV") on February 26th, 2004. The "Folleto 
Informativo" drafted in the Spanish language is the only official document, and no document other than the "Folleto Informativo" shall have 
any legal effect or be relied upon with regard to the Note Issue. 
 
14 
(a) The positive difference on said Payment Date between the Outstanding Nominal Balance of the 
Bonds (prior to the amortisation to take place on said Payment Date) and the Outstanding Nominal 
Balance of the Non-defaulted Shares and Certificates of the last day of the month prior to the Payment 
Date; and 
(b) The Available Resources on said Payment Date, minus the amounts corresponding to the items 
described in sections (i) through (vii) of section V.4.2. of this Prospectus. 
The defaulted Mortgage Shares and Certificates (those with Loans with delayed payments equal or 
above 12 months or declared defaulted by the Doubtful Quality Bank of Spain Circular 4/1991) will 
force the amortisation of the Bonds due to amortise, for an amount equal to their Outstanding 
Nominal Balance. For said amortisation the Available Resources of the Fund will be used, once all the 
prior compromises on the priority order described in section V.4.2. have been met. In the event that 
there are no Available Resources to effect these payments, the corresponding amounts will remain 
outstanding until the following Payment Date. 
Amounts received from the recovery of Defaulted Shares and Certificates will be added to the 
Available Resources of the Fund. 
In the event of Early Liquidation of the Fund, according to section III.10 of this Prospectus, Bonds 
amortisation will be in an only payment in the Liquidation Date of the Fund. 
The amortisation of B Bonds will begin once the A Bonds have been fully amortised. The 
amortisation of C Bonds will begin once the A and B Bonds have been fully amortised. The 
amortisation of the D Bonds will begin once the A, B and C Bonds have been fully amortised.  
II.11.3. 
Exceptional Rules for the Amortisation of the Bonds. 
Notwithstanding section II.11.2. above, A, B, C and D Bonds will be amortised pro rata in proportion 
to the Outstanding Nominal Balance of each Bond, without the need for the previous Series to be fully 
amortised, in the amounts resulting from the application of (a) and (b) of section II.11.2. above, and 
whenever there are sufficient resources to do so, in accordance with section V.4.2. of this Prospectus 
and the difference of section (a) above is equal to zero, when on a Payment Date, the credit 
enhancement of the subordinated classes, that is, the relationship between the Outstanding Nominal 
Balance of the B, C and D Bonds jointly, and the Outstanding Nominal Balance of all the Bonds 
represent twice the relationship between the Outstanding Nominal Balance of the B, C and D Bonds 
jointly, and the Outstanding Nominal Balance of all the Bonds on the date of the constitution of the 
Fund. 
The amortisation of all Series of Bonds will resume the procedure of section II.11.2. above, when on a 
Payment Date, one of the following situations takes place: 
(i) the Reserve Fund does not cover the Minimum Level established in section V.3.4. of this 
Prospectus. 
(ii) in the event that the Sociedad Gestora does not proceed to the early liquidation of the Fund when 
the Outstanding Nominal Balance of the Shares and Certificates is below 10% of its Initial Balance. 
Additionally, the amortisation of each Series on an individual basis will: 
(i) 
cease to be on a pro rata basis for Series B Bonds when the Outstanding Nominal Balance 
of the non-defaulted Shares and Certificates, with non-payments above 90 days, is equal 
or higher than 1.5% of the Outstanding Nominal Balance of all the Bonds on the date of

their constitution. This amortisation will return to the pro rata basis when the Outstanding 
Nominal Balance of the non-defaulted Shares and Certificates, with non-payments above 
90 days falls again below 1.5% but higher than 1% of the Outstanding Nominal Balance 
of all the Bonds on the date of their constitution. 
(ii) 
cease to be on a pro rata basis for Series C Bonds when the Outstanding Nominal Balance 
of the non-defaulted Shares and Certificates, with non-payments above 90 days, is equal 
or higher than 1% of the Outstanding Nominal Balance of all the Bonds on the date of 
their constitution. This amortisation will return to the pro rata basis when the Outstanding 
Nominal Balance of the non-defaulted Shares and Certificates, with non-payments above 
90 days falls again below 1% of the Outstanding Nominal Balance of all the Bonds on the 
date of their constitution, therefore only A, B and C Bonds will be on a pro rata basis. 
(iii) 
irreversibly cease to be on a pro rata basis for Series D Bonds, when the Outstanding 
Nominal Balance of the non-defaulted Shares and Certificates, with non-payments above 
90 days, will be equal or higher than 0.5% of the Outstanding Nominal Balance of all the 
Bonds on the date of their constitution, therefore only A, B and C Bonds will be on a pro 
rata basis.  
II.11.4. 
Maturity of the Bonds Issued 
Amortisation of the Bonds will take place on the date on which they are fully amortised or on the date 
of the Liquidation of the Fund. 
The last regular amortisation date of the Mortgage Loans grouped in the securitised portfolio will be 
December 12th, 2033. 
II.11.5. 
Examples of Amortisation of the Bonds Issued.  
Whilst the Series of Bonds maintain a sequential subordination, on March 22nd, 2006 an amount of 
principal of the Bonds of the A Series will be amortised. This amortisation will be equal to the pro 
rata distribution among each Bond of the Available Resources and always in accordance with the 
priority order established in section V.4.2. of this Prospectus. As a consequence, the following 
reduction of the nominal of every Bond of the A Series will take place; the amount will be equal to 
the pro rata distribution among each Bond of (i) the amount received by the Sellers since November 
30th, 2005 until February 28th, 2006, as principal of the Non-Defaulted Mortgage Shares, in 
accordance with the amortisation program for the Mortgage Loans, including the Technical Advance 
received on said Payment Date; plus (ii) the amount received by the Sellers as Loan Administrators, 
from November 30th, 2005 until February 28th, 2006, as pre-paid principal of the Non-Defaulted 
Shares and Certificates; plus the Outstanding Nominal Balance of the Shares and Certificates declared 
defaulted from the last Payment Date. This amount shall be the equivalent of the amount described in 
section (a) of II.11.2. of this Prospectus.  
If on March 22nd, 2008, all the Series of Bonds begin to amortise pro rata, an amount of principal of 
the A, B, C and D Bonds will be amortised, equal to the pro rata distribution among each one of them 
of the Available Resources, and always in accordance with the priority order of payments established 
in section V.4.2. of this Prospectus. As a consequence, the following reduction of the nominal of each 
Series will take place, in an amount equal to the pro rata distribution among each one of (i) the 
amount received by the Sellers, from November 30th, 2007, until February 28th, 2008, for principal 
of the non-defaulted Shares and Certificates, following the amortisation schedule of the Loans, 
including the Technical Advance received on the Payment Date; plus (ii) the amount received by the 
Sellers, as Loan Administrators, from November 30th, 2007, until February 28th, 2008, for prepaid 
amortised principal of the Shares and Certificates; plus the Outstanding Nominal Balance of the

Shares and Certificates declared defaulted from the last Payment Date. This amount will be equivalent 
to the amount described in section (a) of II.11.2. of this Prospectus. 
Publicity regarding amounts to be paid and Entities responsible for the Financial Service of the 
Fund: Banco Santander Central Hispano will act as the Paying Agent. The payment of interest and 
principal will be announced in national newspapers or through other channels generally accepted in 
the market (AIAF, IBERCLEAR), which ensure the appropriate diffusion of the information, on a 
timely and adequate basis. 
Dates of Notification of payments to be made by the Fund on each Payment Date will be every: 
December, March, June and September 20th of every year throughout the life of the Fund, or the 
Business Day immediately prior in case such dates are not Business Days. 
Periodic information to be provided by the Fund is described in section III.5. 
II.12 
Financial Service of the Fund 
The financial service of the Bonds will be effected through Banco Santander Central Hispano, institution 
appointed as Financial Agent by virtue of the Financial Service Contract entered into by Banco Santander 
Central Hispano and the Sociedad Gestora on behalf of the Fund, according to which all payments to be 
made to Bondholders by the Fund will be made through the Financial Agent. The Bondholders will be 
notified of payments of both principal and interest in accordance with and within the time specified in 
section II.11.4. of this Prospectus. 
The Average Life of the Bonds for different Rates of Prepayment (CPR), assuming the hypotheses

The Average Life of the Bonds has been calculated using the following formula: 
 
Where: 
A= 
Average Life expressed in years. 
Bn= 
Principal to be amortised on each Payment Date 
mn= Months between the Closing Date and each Payment Date. 
n= 
1,..........,n. Number of quarters (Payment Dates) in which the Bn amounts will be paid. 
C= 
Total Amount of the issue in Euros. 
Duration of the Bonds: The concept of duration, when applied to a fixed-income Bond, according to 
Macaulay’s commonly used definition, is a measure of the sensitivity of the value of the asset in relation 
to the change of an index representative of yield observed in the market. In short, the duration is a 
measure of the risk of a change in the value of the Bond as a consequence of the change in the yield of its 
market references. Therefore, this risk measure has a different interpretation for variable rate bonds and 
fixed rate bonds. 
If the Bonds (A, B, C and D) issued by the Fund TDA 19-MIXTO are considered as fixed-rate securities 
for the entire life of the Bond, with a quarterly coupon indicated in the following table, the durations 
resulting from the application of the modified Macaulay formula, shown in years, corresponding to 
portfolio prepayment rates of 5%, 10% y 15% would be:

Where: 
D= 
Modified duration of the Bonds shown in years 
Pn= 
Years between the Closing Date and each Payment Date 
VAn=  Present Value of each of the amounts that investors will receive quarterly, principal and 
interest, discounted annually at the rate of return of the Bond (Yield) 
PE= Price of the Issue, 100,000 Euros. 
I= 
Bond Yield 
Nevertheless, in relation with duration, it must be taken into account that the A, B, C and D Bonds issued 
by the Fund TDA 19-MIXTO are variable-rate, and the consequences of this are explained below. 
During the periods between interest rate revision dates, the market price of a variable-rate Bond will vary 
if market interest rates change. Nevertheless, its price always approximates par on a revision date, as, on 
that date, the cost of holding the Bond may be financed under market conditions similar, with respect to 
the Bond, to those at the purchase date. Nevertheless, the price may not equal par on such a date if certain 
conditions and characteristics (market reference, applicable margin, revision period, average life of the 
Bond, final amortisation of the Bond, etc.) at that moment are valued differently by the market (better or 
worse) than the available investment alternatives. With this exception, however, it can be assumed that 
the price of a variable interest rate Bond is par on its interest rate revision dates. 
As a consequence of the above, the duration of a variable-rate Bond must behave in a manner similar to a 
fixed-rate, zero-coupon Bond with maturity on the same date as the interest rate revision date of the 
variable-rate Bond. Therefore, on a given date, the approximate duration of A, B, C and D Bonds, with a 
period of revision of three months, can be assumed to be the remaining term until the next interest rate 
revision. 
The value for duration mentioned in the above paragraph is the result of the application of the concept 
defined by Macaulay, but taking into consideration that changes in market interest rates will modify the 
flow of Bond payments (in favour of the Bondholder) which does not occur in the case of fixed-rate 
Bonds. 
The prepayment risk of the Bond, that is, the uncertain character of the amounts amortised on each date 
of payment, will affect the duration of the Bond in a very different manner depending on whether its 
interest rate is fixed or variable. While the effect is very important in the case of a fixed-rate Bond, in 
which case the duration is highly dependent on the average life of the Bond, it is not as important in the 
case of a variable-rate Bond, since in this case the duration does not depend on the average life of the 
Bond but rather on the remaining term until the next modification of the interest rate. 
II.13 
Net Effective Interest Rate for the Bondholder (Yield). 
The calculation of the yield of the Bonds for the Holder must take into account the purchase date and 
price of the Bond, the quarterly payment of the coupon and the amortisation payments in accordance with 
the expected schedule. 
To illustrate, on the Closing Date, under the assumption of nominal interest rate for the Bonds listed in 
the following table, held constant for the life of the Fund and paid quarterly, a price of each Bond of 
100% and using the table of theoretical amortisation included in this same section, derived from the

"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores" (the Spanish Securities Market Commission, "CNMV") on February 26th, 2004. The "Folleto 
Informativo" drafted in the Spanish language is the only official document, and no document other than the "Folleto Informativo" shall have 
any legal effect or be relied upon with regard to the Note Issue.

II.14. Effective Interest Rate Expected for the Fund. 
The effective interest rate has been calculated employing the same formula used for the calculation of the 
yield for the Bondholders, adding the initial and periodic costs of the Fund to the flow of payments which 
the Fund makes to the Bondholders, in accordance with the information contained in the table in section 
V.1. of this Prospectus.  
Commissions to the Underwriters for the Issue of the Bonds, 698,700 Euros will be charged to the Fund 
as constitution expenses.  
The Sociedad Gestora will pay the following expenses derived from the Constitution of the Fund: Fees to 
the Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores, admission fees to the AIAF Market, IBERCLEAR fees, 
expenses due to the Rating Agencies, notary public, legal advisors´ expenses, publicity and printing 
expenses and the expenses derived from the audit of the Loans. 
Expenses resulting from the liquidation of the Fund will also be charged to the Fund. 
The effective interest rate expected for the Fund, under the hypotheses stated in section V.1.1. and with 
an assumed CPR of 10% will be 2.636% 
II.15. Special Guarantees on the Mortgage Share Certificates and the Mortgage Transfer 
Certificates. 
The entities taking part in the operation do not grant special guarantees on the Shares and Certificates 
grouped in the Fund nor on the securities issued, except the commitment of the Sellers to proceed to the 
replacement, or repurchase if replacement is not possible, of the Shares and Certificates which present, 
after the Date of Constitution, financial or legal characteristics not consistent with Chapter IV of this 
Prospectus. This commitment is described in section IV.1. of this Prospectus. 
II.16. Transfer of the Bonds. 
The Bonds can be freely transferred by any legal means. Accounting transfer shall transmit the title of 
each Bond. The recording in the accounting register of the transfer in favour of the buyer shall be deemed 
to have the same effect as the delivery of the title and, from that moment, such transfer will be effective 
vis-à-vis third parties. In this sense, the party that may acquire by purchase the Bonds represented as book 
entries from a person that, as regards the entries in the accounts registry, appears to be lawfully entitled to 
transfer them, shall not be subject to any sort of recovery claim, unless such party acted in bad faith or 
with gross negligence at the time of acquisition.

AIAF fixed income market, an organised, secondary securities market, created by the Asociación de 
Intermediarios de Activos Financieros. The listing of the issue in the AIAF Market is expected to be 
completed in the 30 days following the Closing Date, once the necessary authorisations have been 
granted. 
The Sociedad Gestora hereby declares that the requisites and conditions required for the admission, 
permanence and exclusion of securities in the AIAF fixed income market in accordance with current 
legislation, and the requirements of its ruling body are known; the Sociedad Gestora, on behalf of the 
Fund, will undertake their compliance.

The Sociedad Gestora is entitled to replace the Financial Agent (in all or some of its maintenance duties 
of the Fund’s Account, Transfer Account, Payment Agency or Custodian of the Shares and Certificates) 
and entities that undertake, on behalf of the Fund, services derived from the servicing of the Mortgage 
Loans; provided that it conforms with applicable law, and that authorisation of the relevant authorities is 
given. The reason for the substitution must be serious and present serious prejudice to the interests of the 
Bondholders. Notice will be given regarding the substitution to the Comisión Nacional del Mercado de 
Valores, the Rating Agencies and the Sellers. 
In the event that the rating of the Financial Agent assigned by the Rating Agencies is reduced to a rating 
below P1 for Moody’s or F1 for Fitch, the Sociedad Gestora, on behalf of the Fund, prior consultation 
with the Rating Agencies, and within 10 business days of such reduction, must implement one or more of

the obligations derived from the Payment Agent, maintenance of the Fund’s Account, Transfer Account, 
and deposit of the Shares and Certificates: 
(i) 
Obtain from the Financial Agent a pledge in favour of the Fund of financial assets of credit 
quality not less than P1 by Moody’s or F1+ by Fitch, or another recognised by the Rating 
Agencies, with a maximum maturity of five days prior to the following Payment Date, in an 
amount sufficient to guarantee the Financial Service Contract. 
(ii) 
Obtain similar guarantees or commitments from one or more credit institutions with a rating no 
less than P1, granted by Moody’s or F1 by Fitch, or another recognised by the Rating Agencies, 
which guarantee the commitments assumed by the Financial Agent. 
(iii) 
Substitute the Financial Agent for another credit entity with a rating no less than P1, for Moody’s 
or F1 for Fitch, or another recognised by the Rating Agencies, to undertake, under the same 
conditions, the functions of Financial Agent in respect of the Fund’s Account. 
Furthermore, the Financial Agent may terminate the Financial Service Contract, prior notification to the 
Sociedad Gestora two months in advance, in accordance with the terms established in the Financial 
Service Contract whenever (i) another entity with similar financial characteristics to Banco Santander 
Central Hispano and with a credit rating for short term risk at least equal to P1 in Moody’s case or F1 for 
Fitch, or other recognised by the Rating Agencies and accepted by the Sociedad Gestora, substitutes it in 
the functions of the Financial Service Contract, (ii) the Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores and 
the Rating Agencies are notified, and (iii) the rating granted to the Bonds is not affected. The termination 
will not take place, except with the authorisation of the Sociedad Gestora, until two business days after 
the Payment Date following the notification of the termination. 
In the event of breach of their contractual duties, or of adoption of a corporate, legal or judicial decision 
relating to the liquidation, dissolution or judicial investigation of any of the entities taking part in this 
transaction, or if any participant requests to be legally declared insolvent or bankrupt, or if an application 
filed by a third party is admitted to legal proceedings, the Sociedad Gestora shall be entitled to rescind the 
corresponding contracts that bind such participant to the Fund, provided that such cancellation is 
permitted pursuant to the law in force. After the termination of the contract, and provided the applicable 
law permits it, a new participant will be designated by the Sociedad Gestora, provided that the relevant 
administrative authorities have been consulted, that the rating assigned to the Bonds by the Rating 
Agencies is not impaired, and that such designation has been communicated to the Rating Agencies.

delegation shall not imply any additional cost or expense to the Fund nor the Sociedad Gestora, nor will it 
affect the ratings assigned to the Bonds. Despite any subcontract or delegation, the entities taking part in 
the operation shall be neither exonerated nor discharged from any of the responsibilities established in the 
corresponding contracts. The contracted parties will comply with the rating requirements requested by the 
Rating Agencies.  
III.10 Early Liquidation and Termination of the Fund 
By virtue of the Fund Regulations and this Prospectus, the Sociedad Gestora is entitled to proceed to the 
early liquidation of the Fund TDA 19-MIXTO when the amount of the Outstanding Balance of the Shares 
and Certificates is less than 10% of the initial balance, provided the proceeds from the liquidation of the 
assets are sufficient to discharge the outstanding obligations to the Bondholders, in accordance with the 
priority order of payments described in section V.4. of this Prospectus, and that all the necessary 
authorisations have been obtained from the relevant authorities. 
The Fund will be terminated only in the following circumstances, and the Comisión Nacional del 
Mercado de Valores and the Rating Agencies will be informed of such event: 
(i) 
When the Shares and Certificates are totally amortised, including the assumption described in 
section III.6. of this Prospectus for the modification of the fiscal regime, when the requisites 
established are met and the Sellers effect their right to repurchase over the entire Shares and 
Certificates remaining in the Fund, as set out in said section. In the event that all the Shares and 
Certificates have matured and there remain outstanding amounts to be collected and paid to the 
Bondholders, the Fund will be extinguished on March 22nd, 2036. 
If the Sellers exercise their right to repurchase over the total amount of Shares and Certificates 
which remain in the Fund, in accordance with section III.6. of this Prospectus, the exercise of this 
right will coincide with a Calculation Date and will imply the pre-paid amortisation of the Bonds 
on the Payment Date which follows the date in which the payment of the repurchased Shares and 
Certificates takes place. 
(ii) 
When the Bonds issued are totally amortised. 
(iii) 
When, in the opinion of the Sociedad Gestora, exceptional circumstances concur to render 
impossible, or extremely difficult, the survival of the financial balance of the Fund. In this case, 
the Sociedad Gestora, after notifying the CNMV, will proceed to liquidate the Fund in 
accordance with the priority order described in section V.4.2. of this Prospectus. 
(iv) 
In the case set out in Article 19 of Royal Decree 926/1998, that establishes the obligation to 
undertake the early liquidation of the Fund in the event that four months after an event that 
justifies the substitution of the Sociedad Gestora (insolvency proceedings or bankruptcy), no 
alternative Sociedad Gestora has been found to manage the Fund. 
(v) 
When a non-payment of any of the values issued or loans takes place, indicative of a serious and 
permanent imbalance occurs or is expected. In this event, the Sociedad Gestora, after notifying 
the CNMV, will proceed to liquidate the Fund in accordance with the priority order described in 
section V.4.2. of this Prospectus. 
In the absence of confirmation of any of the provisional ratings granted to the Bonds by the Rating 
Agencies before the start of the Subscription Period for the Bonds, the Fund, the issue and subscription of 
the Shares and Certificates, the Subordinated Loans, the Swap Contract and the issue of the Bonds will be 
cancelled.

any legal effect or be relied upon with regard to the Note Issue. 
 
47 
In the event that on the final liquidation of the Fund there remain outstanding obligations on behalf of the 
Fund to any of the Bondholders, the Sociedad Gestora (i) will designate a minimum of three independent 
experts to determine the value of the sale of the Shares and Certificates remaining in the Fund at the time 
of liquidation. In no event will the price of the sale of the Shares and Certificates be inferior to value of 
the sale determined by said experts, and will never be inferior to the market price, understanding market 
price the Outstanding Nominal Balance plus the interest accrued by the Shares and Certificates. The 
designation of said independent experts will be notified to the CNMV and the Rating Agencies; (ii) will 
proceed to cancel those contracts which are unnecessary for the liquidation process, and (iii) if the above 
is not sufficient or assets remain, will sell the remaining assets of the Fund. The Sociedad Gestora is 
empowered to accept those offers it considers cover the market value of the asset in question and are paid 
in cash. In order to fix the market value, the Sociedad Gestora may request the valuation reports it 
considers necessary. 
The Sociedad Gestora, following the reserve for the initial expenses for the liquidation, will apply all the 
amounts obtained from the sale of the assets of the Fund to pay the different concepts, in accordance with 
the priority order established in section V.4.2. of this Prospectus, with the obligation to preserve the 
Reserve Fund, which will be destined to the pre-paid amortisation of the issue. 
In the event that, once the Fund has been terminated and all the payments established in section V.4. of 
this Prospectus have been made, any amount remains, it shall be paid to the Sellers. In the event that the 
amount remaining is not a liquid amount and corresponds to the Shares or Certificates pending legal or 
notary resolution and initiated as a consequence of the non-payment by the Debtor of the Share or 
Certificate, its continuation or the product of its resolution will correspond to the Sellers. 
In any event, the Sociedad Gestora, on behalf of the Fund, will not terminate the Fund and cancel the 
corresponding inscription at the registers until all the assets of the Fund have been sold and distributed in 
the order established in section V.4.2. of this Prospectus, with the exception of the reserve made to pay 
for the initial expenses of the liquidation. 
Following the 6 months after the liquidation of the remaining assets of the Fund and the distribution of 
the available resources, the Sociedad Gestora will grant a notary deed declaring (i) the termination of the 
Fund, and the causes established in the Fund Regulations and this Prospectus which motivated the 
termination, (ii) the procedure undertaken to notify the holders of the Bonds and the CNMV, and (iii) the 
distribution of the available amounts in the order established in section V.4.2. of this Prospectus; this will 
made public in national papers and will comply with the remaining requirements necessary. This deed 
will be forwarded by the Sociedad Gestora to the CNMV. 
III.11 Rights of the Sellers in the Liquidation of the Fund

Certificates, the Sellers will have a right of option to repurchase the Shares and Certificates that each 
Seller sold and which belong to the Fund, corresponding to Mortgage Loans not paid at the moment of 
the liquidation, under the conditions and price established in the previous section. Such right of option 
does not imply, in any case, a pact or declaration of repurchase of the Shares and Certificates given by the 
Sellers. In order to exercise such option each Seller will have 10 Business Days from the date in which 
the Sociedad Gestora will notify the conditions in which the sale of the Shares and Certificates will take 
place.

Young which includes 7,929 loans with an outstanding nominal balance of 631,157,039.66 Euros on 
January 21st, 2004. The percentage of Mortgage Loans 1 and Mortgage Loans 2 in respect to the total 
audited portfolio will be maintained or, may vary only when this variation does not imply an increase of 
the percentage of Mortgage Loans 2. 
As holder of the Shares and Certificates, the Fund will have all the rights recognised in the applicable law 
and in the Shares and Certificates themselves.  
The Sociedad Gestora will adjust on the Closing Date the specific number of Shares and Certificates, 
depending on the substitutions which have taken place to that date, in accordance with the Fund 
Regulations. 
The final sale of the Mortgage Loans will take place on the Closing Date for the remaining term to 
maturity of the Loans, with no repurchase agreement. The constitution of the Fund, the issue of the 
Shares and Certificates and the issue of the Bonds will be made on the Closing Date. 
The Sellers do not assume any liability whatsoever for the non-payment by the Mortgage debtors of 
principal, interest or any other amount that may be due by virtue of the Mortgage Loans. The Sellers do 
not, under any circumstance, assume any responsibility in guaranteeing, either directly or indirectly, the 
success of the transaction, nor will they give guarantees or warranties, nor enter into repurchase 
agreements for the Shares and Certificates nor in virtue of the Fund Regulations or any other agreement 
or contract. The above is without prejudice to the responsibilities of the Sellers with respect to that 
established in the Loan Contracts (Initial Expenses Loan, Subordinated Loan and Participative Loan), 
Swap Contract and the compromises set out in Clauses 9 and 10 of the Fund Regulations described in 
section IV.2. of this Prospectus.

Shares and Certificates will not be subject to withholding of any kind, in virtue of article 57 p of Royal 
Decree 537/1997 of April 14th.  
In the event that in the future, direct or indirect, charges or expenses of said payments, are established, 
they will be paid by the Sellers and will be reimbursed by the Fund in the event of their recovery. 


CHAPTER IV– Information Relating to the Assets of the Fund 
This prospectus is a translation into English of the original "Folleto Informativo" drafted in Spanish language and registered with the 
"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores" (the Spanish Securities Market Commission, "CNMV") on February 26th, 2004. The "Folleto 
Informativo" drafted in the Spanish language is the only official document, and no document other than the "Folleto Informativo" shall have 
any legal effect or be relied upon with regard to the Note Issue. 
 
50 
Notwithstanding the above, and in the event that the fiscal regime is modified and new taxes or 
withholdings are established for the payments due to the Fund for the interest of the Shares and 
Certificates, negatively affecting the financial balance of the Fund, the Sellers will have the right to 
repurchase the Shares and Certificates issued by them in the terms set out in section III.6. of this 
Prospectus. 
Rights of the Fund derived from the Subscription of Shares and Certificates: The Fund, as holder of 
the Shares and Certificates, shall have the rights recognised in the applicable legislation and in the Shares 
and Certificates. In particular, it will have the right to receive all the payments made by the Mortgage 
Loan debtors from the Closing Date onwards, on any account whatsoever, and any other payment arising 
from the Mortgage Loans, provided such payments correspond to the Shares and Certificates. The Shares 
and Certificates will begin to accrue interest from the Closing Date. 
In addition to the payments made by the Mortgage Loan debtors, any other payment received by the 
Sellers in relation to the Mortgage Loans, including those arising from any accessories to the Loans such 
as compensation derived from insurance policies, payments made by possible guarantors, etc., will 
correspond to the Fund, with the exception of delinquent interest, unpaid receipt claims, subrogation 
commissions and prepayment, together with any other commission which will correspond to the Sellers 
of the Shares and Certificates. The Sellers will make the necessary notifications so that the payments to 
the Sociedad Gestora are made. The Sellers must undertake reasonable efforts to maintain with full 
effects insurance policies subscribed in relation to the Mortgage Loans, and they will be responsible for 
any damages to the Fund in the event the insurance policies have not been maintained.  
Notifications 
The Sellers will continue to administer the Mortgage Loans in accordance with section IV.2. of this 
Prospectus. The Sociedad Gestora and the Sellers have agreed not to notify the sale to the debtors of the 
Mortgage Loans as this notification is not a condition for the development of the Issue. 
As a consequence of article 1,527 of the Civil Code, the debtor that pays the creditor without knowledge 
of the issue will be exonerated from the obligation. The Seller will notify the sale to the respective 
Debtors when it is necessary or required in the conditions of the corresponding Mortgage Loan, and the 
Sociedad Gestora so requires it. Following notification, the Debtors will be freed of their obligations 
following payment to the Payment Agent. In accordance with article 1,198 of the Civil Code, the Debtor 
that agrees to the sale will not have recourse against the Fund for the compensation due from the Seller. 
Nevertheless, the Sellers will grant the widest faculties legally necessary to the Sociedad Gestora so that 
it can notify the sale to the debtors of the Mortgage Loans when deemed necessary. In particular, the 
Sociedad Gestora will notify the sale to the debtors of the Mortgage Loans in the event of the substitution 
of the Sellers in the administration of the Mortgage Loans and in the event of an administrative or judicial 
intervention of the Sellers. 
The Sellers will bear the expenses of the notification to the debtors of the Mortgage Loans event in the 
event that the Sociedad Gestora carries out such notification. 
C. Replacement of the Mortgage Share Certificates and the Mortgage Transfer Certificates 
In the exceptional circumstances in which, despite the declarations made by the Sellers and their efforts to 
ensure correspondence, a particular Mortgage Loan on the Date of the Constitution of the Fund or the 
Closing Date, does not comply with the representations set out in section IV.4. below and in Clause 8 of 
the Fund Regulations, the Sellers undertake:

any legal effect or be relied upon with regard to the Note Issue. 
 
51 
(A) To replace the corresponding Share and/or Certificate by another one with similar financial 
characteristics in terms of amount, term to maturity and interest rate, and that is acceptable to the 
Sociedad Gestora, prior consultation with the Rating Agencies. 
In any case, in the event of replacement of a Share and/or Certificate, the Sellers must demonstrate that 
the Share and/or Certificate is in accordance with the conditions referred to in section IV.4. of this 
Prospectus. 
Each Seller, as soon as it becomes aware that a Share and/or Certificate issued does not correspond to the 
cited representations, will inform the Sociedad Gestora and indicate the Mortgage Loans that will be 
presented to replace the faulty ones. In the event that any of the Shares and/or Certificates are substituted 
in accordance with these provisions, the Sellers will issue a new Multiple Deed, which will be substituted 
for the one provided in accordance with the Fund Regulations. 
(B) In addition to the obligations assumed in paragraph (A), and in the exceptional cases in which, even 
though the Sellers have fulfilled these obligations, the substitution is not possible because the available 
Mortgage Loans, for reasons not attributable to the Seller, are not similar to the securitised portfolio in 
terms of (i) amount, (ii) term to maturity, (iii) interest rate, (iv) characteristics of the borrower, or (v) 
characteristics of the mortgaged property, and the lack of conformity of any of these elements with 
respect to the affected Share and/or Certificate is sufficiently important that it affects adversely the 
legality or financial structure of the Fund and the rights and interests of the Bondholders, in the justified 
opinion of the Sociedad Gestora, which will so inform the Seller and the Comisión Nacional del Mercado 
de Valores, the Seller will agree to reimburse the outstanding principal of the corresponding Share and/or 
Certificate and the interest accrued and unpaid to date transferring them to the Transfer Account. 
Furthermore, on the Closing Date the Shares and Certificates (i) fully amortised between the Date of 
Constitution of the Fund and the Closing Date, or, (ii) do not comply with the requirements of sections 
IV.4.2. and IV.4.3., will be replaced by other Shares and Certificates of similar financial characteristics. 
In both cases the substitution will be documented in a notary deed and notified to the Comisión Nacional 
del Mercado de Valores. 
D. Custody of the Mortgage Share Certificates and the Mortgage Transfer Certificates and other 
Fund Assets 
On the Date of the Constitution of the Fund, the Sellers will deliver the Multiple Deeds representing the 
Mortgage Share Certificates and Mortgage Transfer Certificates subscribed, to the Sociedad Gestora, 
which will proceed to deposit the Deeds with the Financial Agent, in accordance with the provisions of 
the Financial Service Contract. 
IV.2 
Servicing of the Mortgage Loans 
In accordance with article 61 (3) of Royal Decree 685/1982, of March 17th, and in section 2.b) of Article 
2 of Royal Decree 926/1998, each Seller has undertaken to maintain the custody and servicing of the 
Mortgage Loans it has issued from which the Shares and Certificates are derived, remaining responsible 
to undertake whatever actions are necessary for the effective collection of the Mortgage Loans. In any 
case, the Sociedad Gestora, on behalf of the Fund, will undertake to exercise all powers that, in the case 
of default in the payment by the borrower, correspond to the holders of Shares and Certificates in article 
66 of Royal Decree 685/1982.  
All taxes, direct or indirect, charges or expenses accrued and incurred by the Sellers or those that must 
pass on in relation to the evolution of the services of the administration of the Mortgage Loans, without

Seller will reimburse the Fund or the Sociedad Gestora for the damages (justified by the Sociedad 
Gestora) consequence of said negligence. 
In any event, the Fund, through the Sociedad Gestora will have the legal actions available against each 
Seller in the event of a fault in its obligations in respect of the contracts subscribed with the Sociedad 
Gestora. 
IV.2.2. 
Administration of the Mortgage Loans 
In the administration of the Mortgage Loans, the Sellers will dedicate the same amount and attention and 
will exert the same level of ability, detail and diligence in said administration, as would employ in the

Specifically, each Seller, as Mortgage Loan Administrator, will keep under safe custody all the deeds, 
documents, files and any other accessories of the Mortgage Loans, together with any relevant documents.

Administrators, shall take the usual steps to remedy such situation, described in the Annex 7 of the Fund

Following the termination of the Shares and Certificates, the Fund, through the Sociedad Gestora, will 
maintain the right to take action against the Sellers until all its obligations have been carried out. 
IV.2.3. 
Subcontracting 
The Sellers, in relation to the Mortgage Loans they administers, are entitled to subcontract or delegate to 
third parties of recognised solvency and capacity, the performance of any of the services agreed in Clause 
10 of the Fund Regulations, provided it is legally possible and (i) there is written authorisation from the 
Sociedad Gestora, (ii) the sub-contractor or delegate has a rating equal or higher than the rating required 
by the Rating Agencies, and (iii) the subcontractor or delegate has waived all rights of recourse against 
the Fund. 
In any event, such subcontracting or delegation shall not imply any additional cost or expense to the Fund 
nor the Sociedad Gestora.  
Notwithstanding a subcontract or delegation, the corresponding Seller will not be exonerated nor 
liberated from said subcontract or delegation of any of the responsibilities undertaken by virtue of the 
Fund Regulations. 
IV.2.4. 
Substitution of the Seller as Administrator of the Shares and Certificates by the 
Sociedad Gestora 
In the event that the Sociedad Gestora verifies the breach, by a Seller, as Mortgage Loan Administrator, 
of the obligations established in this section, or the occurrence of events that, in the opinion of the 
Sociedad Gestora, derive in a prejudice or risk to the financial structure of the Fund or to the rights and 
interests of the Bondholders, the Sociedad Gestora will, in accordance with current legislation, (i) 
substitute the appropriate Seller as Administrator or (ii) request the appropriate Seller to subcontract or 
delegate the undertaking of said obligations to the person that, in the opinion of the Sociedad Gestora, has 
the technical capacity to carry out such obligations. The Sociedad Gestora will take into account the 
proposals made by the Sellers in the designation of a substitute. The appropriate Seller will carry out such 
subcontracting or delegation. 
Furthermore, it a corporate, legal or judicial decision is reached concerning the liquidation, dissolution or 
intervention of a Seller or it requests to be declared in suspension of payments or bankruptcy, or a third 
party forwards a claim, the Sociedad Gestora will substitute it as Administrator of the Mortgage Loans, if 
permitted by current legislation. 
The Sociedad Gestora will designate the new administrator of the Mortgage Loans once the relevant 
authorities have been consulted, to avoid affecting the rating granted to the Bonds by the Rating 
Agencies. The designation will be notified to the Rating Agencies. The Sociedad Gestora will agree with 
the new administrator the amount to be received, which will be considered an extraordinary expense and 
will be paid in accordance with the priority order of payments described in section V.4.2. of this 
Prospectus.  
In the event that current legislation permits it, the Seller may request its substitution as administrator of 
the Mortgage Loans; related expenses will be paid by the Seller. The Sociedad Gestora will authorise 
said substitution when the Seller has identified a replacement and the rating assigned to the Bonds by the 
Rating Agencies is not impaired. The substitution will be notified to the Rating Agencies. 
In the event of substitution, the replaced Seller will forward all the documentation to the new 
administrator.

IV.2.5. 
Modifications of the Mortgage Loans 
In accordance with article 25 of Royal Decree 685/1982 of March, 17th, the Sellers are not entitled 
(without the consent of the Sociedad Gestora) to voluntarily cancel the Mortgages underlying the Shares 
and Certificates for any other reason other than payment of the Mortgage Loans, to waive or compound 
them, to make a novation of the Mortgage Loans, to remit or pardon them partially or in full, to prorogue 
them or, in general, carry out any act that might impair or decrease the rank, legal enforceability or 
economic value of the Mortgages or the Mortgage Loans except by the modifications outlined in the 
following paragraph. 
Each Seller, as Administrator will, from the Date of the Constitution of the Fund, be authorised, as long 
as the rating assigned to the Bonds is not impaired, that payments to the Fund are not affected in a 
negative way, and that notice is given to the Sociedad Gestora and by the latter to the Rating Agencies, 
to: 
(i) 
Permit subrogations of the Mortgage Loan contracts, provided that the characteristics of the new 
debtor are similar to those of the existing debtor and that these are consistent with the criteria 
contained in the Seller’s Internal Memorandum On the Granting of Mortgage Loans. 
(ii)

section are in full vigour.

event that a Seller agrees the modifications of the interests of a Mortgage Loan, and as a consequence of 
the corresponding Share or Certificate, the totality of ordinary interests accrued by the Mortgage Loan 
will still correspond to the Fund. In no event will this renegotiation lower the applicable margin of a 
mortgage loan, when the weighted average margin by outstanding nominal balance of the maturity of the 
mortgage loans is less than 0.75%. Additionally, for Cajamar's mortgage loans, the date of revision of 
their interest will not be modified, and the reference rate, except for the loans with a reference rate 
different to EURIBOR or MIBOR .

(a) 
That, in all cases, the periodicity of the amortisation quotas of the Mortgage Loan’s principal is 
maintained or reduced, keeping the same amortisation system. 
(b) 
That the new final maturity date of the loan is not later than December 12th, 2033.  
(c) 
That the Mortgage Loan to be modified has not suffered delays in the payment of due quotas in 
the six months prior to the modification and the Loan is currently being paid. 
(d) 
That, together with the Mortgage Loan, the corresponding deed of modification of the Mortgage 
Loan is granted and inscribed in the Registro de la Propiedad maintaining the category of senior 
mortgage. 
(e) That the expenses derived from the modification of the Mortgage Loans are borne by the 
corresponding Seller or the loan debtor and, in no case by the Fund. 
(f) The amount resulting from the sum of the initial balance of the Loans with an extended final maturity 
date will exceed 5% of the initial balance of the Loans grouped in the Fund.

(h) The Sociedad Gestora, in representation of the Fund, will, at any time during the life of the Fund,

Spanish credit entities, with the purpose of financing the acquisition, construction and restoration of 
residences, following the standard market analysis and granting criteria; therefore the only differentiating 
element of said loans is the percentage financed over the appraisal value. Considering the above, all the 
mortgage loans grouped in the Fund can be considered homogeneous. 
Selection of the Loans 
The selection of Mortgage Loans, taken from the 7,929 loans audited on January 21st, 2004, with a live 
balance of that date of 631,157,039.66 Euros, includes Mortgage Loans with annual interest rates 
between 2.514% and 7.25% approximately, and with a remaining weighted term to maturity of 273.83 
months. All Mortgage Loans accrue interest at a variable rate without prejudice to the fact that during an 
initial period fixed rates may be established. In the initial selection there are loans with a EURIBOR 
reference rate with a weighed margin of 1.17%; IRPH reference rate, with a weighed margin of 0.24%; 
and with MIBOR reference rate, with a weighed margin of 1.02%. The margin of the loans with 
EURIBOR may oscillate, as a result of the compensations between the loaner and the Entity, between 0.5 
and 1.75%. 
 
The purpose of the Mortgage Loans underlying the Shares and Certificates is the acquisition and 
rehabilitation of homes by private individuals. Neither loans to promoters nor those destined to finance 
properties other than housing have been included in the selected portfolio. Some of the loans might 
include, as a guarantee, another type of property (parking lot, premises) that will always be attached to the 
dwelling that constitutes the main guarantee of the Mortgage Loan. 
 
The selection includes Mortgage Loans with up to 1 month delayed payments.

V.1.1. 
Assumptions 
The tables below refer to three of the possible assumptions, (constant prepayment rates of 5%, 10% 
and 15%) that, in respect of the income and payments made by the Fund, might occur during the life 
of the Fund and the Bonds issue. 
For the calculation of the financial service table of the Fund, the data have been taken from the 
portfolio referred to in the previous Chapter on January 21st, 2004.  
In relation to the Shares and Certificates 
• 
Volume of the Loan Portfolio from which the Loans underlying the issue of Shares and 
Certificates will be selected: 599,999,999.96 
 
Shares: 522,796,769.40 Euros 
 
Certificates: 77,203,230.56 Euros 
• 
Interest Rate: the weighted average interest rate for the Shares and Certificates portfolio is 3.53%, 
without prejudice to the revisions which will be established in accordance with the following 
paragraph. 


CHAPTER V– Financial and Economic Information Relating to the Fund  
This prospectus is a translation into English of the original "Folleto Informativo" drafted in Spanish language and registered with the 
"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores" (the Spanish Securities Market Commission, "CNMV") on February 26th, 2004. The "Folleto 
Informativo" drafted in the Spanish language is the only official document, and no document other than the "Folleto Informativo" shall have 
any legal effect or be relied upon with regard to the Note Issue. 
 
72 
• 
The interest rate of the loans on each period: the current margin on January 21st, 2004, for each 
one of them to its own interest rate. From March 31st, 2004, it will be held constant, and its value 
is calculated: a) for the loans referred to MIBOR and EURIBOR, the value is equal to the 
reference of the Bonds; b) for loans with reference rates different from those above, the value is 
equal to the MIBOR established in accordance with a) plus 1.208%.  
• 
Weighted average initial life of the Shares and Certificates contained in the portfolio: 274 months. 
• 
Annual prepayment rate: assumption 5%, 10% and 15%. 
• 
Shares Default rate: 0.3% annually for the Defaulted Shares and Certificates, from February 2005, 
and 75% recoveries from the Defaulted Stock a year later.  
Bonds 
• 
Total Amount: 600,000,000 Euros. 
A Bonds: 567,300,000 Euros  
B Bonds: 19,200,000 Euros 
C Bonds: 6,000,000 Euros 
D Bonds: 7,500,000 Euros 
• 
Interest Rate: Variable annual interest to be paid quarterly. The Bond’s interest rate is the result of 
the following sum: an EURIBOR rate of 2.080%, a margin of 0.23% for the A Bonds, a margin of 
0.60% for the B Bonds, a margin of 1.10% for the C Bonds, and a margin of 3.50% for the D 
Bonds. For the first period an interpolation between 3 and 4 month EURIBOR has been 
considered, resulting in a rate of 2.089%. 
Other Resources Deposited 
The difference between the amount corresponding to the issue of the Bonds and the balance of the 
Shares and Certificates acquired by the Fund is included under the heading “Other Resources 
Deposited”. This amount, 0.04 Euros in the previous balance, will be deposited at the Fund’s Account 
until the first Payment Date, date in which it will be fully destined to the Bond’s amortisation; 
nevertheless, it is not reflected in the Financial Tables. 
Initial Expenses Loan: 
• 
Amount: 698,700 Euros. The amount of the Loan will be used pay the initial expenses of the 
Fund. 
• 
Interest Rate: the Loan bears a variable annual interest rate equal to the Reference Interest Rate of 
the Bonds during such period plus a margin of 0.75%. 
• 
Amortisation: The amortisation of the Initial Expenses Loan will be made in 20 consecutive and 
equal quotas, the first of which will take place on the first Payment Date (June 22nd, 2004) and the 
rest on the following Payment Dates. 


CHAPTER V– Financial and Economic Information Relating to the Fund  
This prospectus is a translation into English of the original "Folleto Informativo" drafted in Spanish language and registered with the 
"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores" (the Spanish Securities Market Commission, "CNMV") on February 26th, 2004. The "Folleto 
Informativo" drafted in the Spanish language is the only official document, and no document other than the "Folleto Informativo" shall have 
any legal effect or be relied upon with regard to the Note Issue. 
 
73 
Subordinated Loan: 
• 
Amount: 1,100,000 Euros. The amount of the Loan will be used by the Sociedad Gestora to cover 
the difference of the Fund, on the first Payment Date, between the interest accrual and payment of 
the Shares and Certificates. 
• 
Interest Rate: the Loan bears a variable annual interest rate equal to the Reference Interest Rate of 
the Bonds during such period plus a margin of 0.75%. 
• 
Amortisation: The amortisation will take place on each Payment Date by a reduction of the 
outstanding principal in relation to the need for resources to cover the difference between the 
accrual and payment of the interest of the Shares and Certificates.  
Participative Loan: 
• 
Amount: 12,600,000 Euros. The amount of the Loan will be used to establish the Reserve Fund. 
• 
Interest Rate: The remuneration of the Loan will have two components, a fixed one equal to the 
interests accrued by the Outstanding Nominal Balance of the loan at an interest rate equal to the 
Reference Interest Rate of the Bonds during such period, plus a margin of 1%. And another 
component of a variable nature, which will be determined in accordance with, section V.3.5. of 
this Prospectus. 
• 
Amortisation: Amortisation of the Participative Loan will take place on each Payment Date for an 
amount equal to the amount in which the Minimum Level of the Reserve Fund is reduced. 
Financial Swap: The Fund will swap with Bear Stearns Bank Plc the result of multiplying the 
nocional amount of the financial swap by the calculation factor, in order to multiply this nocional 
amount by the Reference Interest Rate of the Bonds. 
 
Reinvestment of the Flows: The flows received by the Fund (principal and interest of the Loan

Gestora, AIAF Market and CNMV. This information is also available through the Underwriters and 
others active in the secondary market. As stated in section V.2. of this Prospectus, the Sociedad 
Gestora commits itself to make the information relating thereto available to the general public. In 
addition, the interest rate of the Bonds used for purposes of the calculation in the following table of the 
financial service of the Fund might not coincide with the rate assigned on the Issue Date.

amount in which, on each Payment Date, the Minimum Level of the Reserve Fund is reduced, all in 
accordance with the priority of payments established in section V.4.2..  
Due to the subordinated nature of the Participative Loan, in relation to the rest of the Fund’s 
obligations, and that its reimbursement depends on the performance of the Shares and Certificates, 
and the evolution of the interest rates paid to the Bonds issued, the remuneration of the Participative 
Loan will have two components, one known and another one variable and related to the evolution of 
the risks of the Fund: 
(i) “Fixed Remuneration of Participative Loan”: the Outstanding Nominal Balance of the Participative 
Loan will accrue interests calculated on the base of a variable interest rate equal to the reference 
interest rate of the Bond current at each moment, in accordance with section II.10. of this Prospectus 
plus a margin of 1%. 
(ii) “Variable Remuneration of Participative Loan”, will be equal to the positive difference between (i) 
the interests and other amounts received from the Shares and Certificates grouped in the Fund plus the 
yield generated by the Fund’s investments; (ii) plus, the net amount derived from the Swap Contract; 
minus (iii) the expenses (including taxes) of the Fund and which will be calculated in accordance with 
Clause 14.5. of the Fund Regulations. 
V.3.4. Reserve Fund 
As coverage for possible losses due to unpaid and/or defaulted Mortgage Loans, and in order to allow 
the payments to be made by the Fund, in accordance with the priority order established in section

The Reserve Fund will be constituted initially on the Closing Date, with charge to the Participative 
Loan, for an amount of 12,600,000 Euros. 
On each Payment Date, the Reserve Fund will be funded, in its case, until the Minimum Level of the 
Reserve Fund is reached, with the resources that, on each Payment Date, are available to such effect, 
in accordance with the priority order described in section V.4.2.. 
The Minimum Level of the Reserve Fund will be the lesser of the following amounts:

the following amounts: 
1) 1.05% of the initial balance of the issue of the Bonds. 
2) 0.5% of the initial balance of the issue of the Bonds, plus the higher of (i) 0.95% of the Outstanding 
Nominal Balance of the Shares and Certificates issued by Caixa Tarragona or (ii) the higher of the 
amounts collected in the last 6 Calculation Dates by the Fund in respect of the Shares and Certificates 
issued by Caixa Tarragona multiplied by 1.05

the Fund will be made through the Fund’s Account. 
The Fund’s Account will not have a negative balance against the Fund. All balances of the Fund’s 
Account will be maintained in cash. 
The amounts deposited in the Fund’s Account will accrue interest in favour of the Fund on the basis 
of a variable rate equal to the result of reducing the average of the Interbank market interest rate 1 
month published by Banco de España, by a margin of 0.30%. The average of the Interbank market 
interest rate 1 month published by Banco de España, and the way to calculate the interest accrued by

downgrading to maintain an adequate level of guarantee in respect of the compromises derived from 
the maintenance of the Fund’s Account: 
Obtain from the Financial Agent, a guarantee in favour of the Fund regarding financial assets with a 
credit rating not inferior to P1 granted by Moody’s or F1+ by Fitch, or another recognised by the 
Rating Agencies, with a term equal to 5 days prior to the following Payment Date, for an amount 
sufficient to guarantee the compromises described in the Financial Service Contract. 
Obtain from a credit entity with rating for short term risk no less than P1, granted by Moody’s, or F1

assumed by the Financial Agent. 
Replace the Financial Agent for another credit entity with a rating no less than P1, granted by 
Moody’s or F1 by Fitch, or other recognised by the Rating Agencies, that will assume, under the same 
conditions, the functions of the Financial Agent. 
V.3.5.3. Reinvestment Account 
In the event that a Seller obtains a rating equal to the highest rating for short term risk, granted by the 
Rating Agencies (P1 for Moody's or F1 for Fitch) or any other Rating Agency recognised by them, the 
Sociedad Gestora will open an account (hereon, Reinvestment Account) in the name of the Fund at 
the corresponding Seller (hereon, Seller With Rating), through which on each Calculation Date, all the 
amounts that the Fund were to receive from the Seller. The Seller With Rating will sign a contract 
with the Sociedad Gestora, on behalf of the Fund, to regulate the management of the Reinvestment 
Account. 
The Seller With Rating will undertake the services of management and maintenance of the aforesaid 
account, in accordance with regular banking practice. Expenses generated from the maintenance of 
said account will be assigned to the Seller, except when the expenses are generated by the negligence 
of the Sociedad Gestora. 
Positive balances resulting at each of the Reinvestment Accounts, will accrue an annual variable 
interest rate in favour of the Fund, equal to EURIBOR as defined in the corresponding Contrato de 
Depósito con Tipo de Interés Garantizado. 
Prior consultation with the Sociedad Gestora, the Seller With Rating will make all the necessary 
payments to attend the obligations of the Fund through the Financial Agent. 
In the event that the Seller With Rating is downgraded by the Rating Agencies, to a rating inferior to 
the highest rating for short term risk, the Sociedad Gestora, on behalf of the Fund, will transfer all the 
amounts deposited at the Reinvestment Account to the Fund’s Account. Equally, and from that 
moment, said Seller will transfer on each Transfer Date, all the amounts that, as Loan Administrator, 
and in accordance with this Prospectus, it obtains in the future. Nevertheless, if the Seller presents a 
banking endorsement, sufficient in the opinion of the Sociedad Gestora, from a credit entity with a 
rating equal to the maximum granted by the Rating Agencies for short term risk, guaranteeing the 
total availability of the amounts deposited in the Reinvestment Account, the Seller will be able to 
maintain the Reinvestment Account. 
At the time of the signing of the Fund’s Regulations, no Seller has a sufficient rating, in accordance 
with this section, to open a Reinvestment Account.

85 
V.3.6. Technical Advance 
Taking into account that some of the delays in the payments made by the borrowers have an interim 
or technical character, and with the purpose of avoiding that such delays negatively affect the flow of 
payments to the Bondholders, and taking into account that there is a lapse of 20 days between the end 
of the Collection Period and the Calculation Date on behalf of the Fund, and that the amounts 
collected by the Seller, as Loan Administrator, belong to the Fund, the Sociedad Gestora, on behalf of 
the Fund, will be entitled to receive on every Calculation Date an advance on account of such 
amounts.  
The amount of the Technical Advance cannot exceed the amount collected by the Seller, of the Loans 
it administers, for any concept related to the Fund in relation to the Shares and Certificates, from the 
end of the last Collection Period until the Calculation Date on which the Technical Advance is 
requested. 
The Sociedad Gestora will calculate the Technical Advance for each Transfer Date, as an amount 
equal to the sum of the matured amounts and not yet collected by the Seller, during the previous 
Transfer Period, for principal and interest from the Shares and Certificates issued by the Seller 
underlying the defaulted Mortgage Loans on the Calculation Date on which the Technical Advance is 
requested, taking into account the limitations described in the previous paragraph. The Technical 
Advance will not be superior, in respect of each Mortgage Loan, to the interests and principal on the 
last quota. 
On each Calculation Date, the Technical Advance delivered on the previous Calculation Date may be 
deducted from the amounts to be transferred, and a new Technical Advance corresponding to the 
following payment may be requested. 
V.3.7. Financial Interest Swap Contract 
The Sociedad Gestora, in representation and on behalf of the Fund, will settle with Bear Stearns Bank 
Plc a Financial Swap Contract described as follows.

V.3.7.1. Liquidation Dates 
The Liquidation Dates will coincide with the Payment Dates of the Bonds, March 22nd, June 22nd, 
September 22nd and December 22nd, or if this date is not a Business Day, the immediately following 
Business Day. The first Payment Date of the Fund will be June 22nd, 2004. 
V.3.7.2. Liquidation Periods 
Liquidation Periods shall be the days elapsed between two consecutive Liquidation Dates, including 
the first and excluding the last. Exceptionally, the first liquidation period will have a duration 
equivalent to the days elapsed from the Closing Date (included) and June 22nd, 2004 (excluded).

V.3.7.3. Amounts to be paid by Part A 
The result of multiplying the Nocional Amount of the Liquidation Period by the Reference Interest 
Rate of the Bonds established for each Payment Date, as is defined in section II.10.1 of this 
Prospectus. To calculate Part A the days elapsed on an annual basis of 360 will be taken into account. 
V.3.7.4. Amounts to be paid by Part B 
The amounts to be paid by Part B shall be the product, in relation to the days elapsed and on a 360 
basis, of the "nocional amount of the Financial Swap Contract" by the Calculation Factor, defined as 
follows. 
Calculation Factor shall be the weighted average of the 12-month EURIBORs obtained on each 
Reference Date, calculated as follows: (0.0318 * 12-month EURIBOR month of March) + (0.0344 * 
12-month EURIBOR month of April) + (0.0484 * 12-month EURIBOR month of May) + (0.1282 * 
12-month EURIBOR month of June) + (0.2629 * 12-month EURIBOR month of July) + (0.1640 * 
12-month EURIBOR month of August) + (0.1544 * 12-month EURIBOR month of September) + 
(0.0804 * 12-month EURIBOR month of October) + (0.0243 * 12-month EURIBOR month of 
November) + (0.0221 * 12-month EURIBOR month of December) + (0.0249 * 12-month EURIBOR 
month of January) + (0.0242 * 12-month EURIBOR month of February). 
The Reference Dates shall be the 20th of each month, beginning on March 20th, 2003. 
The Nocional Amount of the Liquidation Period shall be the outstanding nominal balance of the 
Bonds in the proportion represented by the Outstanding Nominal Balance of the Shares and 
Certificates issued by Cajamar, on the corresponding liquidation date. 
As 71% of Cajamar's mortgage loans have maximum and minimum rates, in the event that any of the 
12-month EURIBORs used in the previous calculation is below 2.25% or above 14.25%, the amount 
to be paid by Part B shall be the sum of: (i) the amount resulting from applying the Calculation Factor 
to the Nocional Amount of the Liquidation Period plus/minus, (ii) the result of multiplying the 
difference between 2.25% and 14.25% and those EURIBORs which are lower or higher than, through 
the weighing corresponding to said EURIBORs and by 71% of the Nocional Amount of the 
Liquidation Period. 
V.3.7.5. Swap Contract breaches 
If on a Liquidation Date, the Fund does not pay the amount due to Bear Stearns Bank Plc, the Swap 
Contract may be terminated by request from Bear Stearns Bank Plc. In the event that there is a 
liquidation payment to be made, the Fund will assume, if applicable, such payment established in the 
Swap Contract, always in accordance with the Priority Order of Payments. Without prejudice to the 
above, except in a situation of permanent financial unbalance of the Fund, the Sociedad Gestora, in 
representation and on behalf of the Fund, will try an arrange another financial swap contract. 
If on a Payment Date Bear Stearns Bank Plc does not pay the amounts due to the Fund, the Sociedad 
Gestora may terminate the Swap Contract. In this case, Bear Stearns Bank Plc will assume the 
payment obligation of the liquidation amount established in the Contract. Furthermore, in this case, if 
the liquidation amount corresponds to Bear Stearns Bank Plc and not to the Fund, payment will take 
place in accordance with the Priority Order of Payments of the Fund. 
The liquidation amount will be calculated by the Sociedad Gestora, as Swap calculation agent, taking 
into account the market value for Financial Interest Swap Contracts.

CHAPTER VII 
MARKET CONSIDERATIONS  
VII.1  Recent and Significant Trends of the Mortgage Market in General and of the 
Mortgage Loan Market in Particular and of the Securitization Bonds. 
 
In recent years credit assets with mortgage guarantees in the Balance of Spanish credit entities have 
become the main protagonists of the Securitization processes of the Spanish financial system. 
On the one hand, the existence of a critical mass with the sufficient size within a subgroup of this type of 
mortgage assets has been critical: mortgage loans to private individuals to finance the acquisition, 
construction or restoration of properties. On the other, the contribution has come from the decisive way in 
which this type of financing share a series of homogeneous characteristics from the legal and financial 
points of view. 
The new legislation emerging from the Ministerial Order of May 5th, 1994, regarding the transparency of 
the financial conditions of the mortgage loans, and its subsequent development in the Bank of Spain 
Circular 5/94 of July 22nd has been one of the elements that has strengthened this homogeneity. 
Secondly, it is worth noting that in recent years the competition within the Spanish mortgage market has 
intensified, once private individual and credit entities have assumed the tools offered presented to them 
by Law 2/94 of March 30th, regarding subrogation and modification of the mortgage loans. The future 
influence of the announced reform of the taxation related to mortgage cancellation must also be added; 
this inevitably will also influence the rates of mortgage prepayment. 
Finally, the importance of the Securitised Bonds in relation to the new changes derived from the new 
mechanisms introduced by the Central European Bank in Economic Policy must be noted. Greater 
competition demands the improvement of those instruments, which allow access to cheaper sources of 
financing: instruments of issue, secondary markets, or generating techniques for a more efficient 
management of the entities’ balance. 
VII.2 Implications Derived from those Trends Mentioned in the Previous Section. 
The total amount of Mortgage Loans participated by the Mortgage Share Certificates and the Mortgage 
Transfer Certificates grouped in TDA 19-MIXTO, Fondo de Titulización de Activos, carry a variable 
interest rate; some of which will accrue, during a transition period, at a fixed rate, such rates are modified 
periodically by variations in the interest rates of the market. Therefore, it is not probable that important 
modifications in the Prepayment Rates of the portfolio will occur due to changes in the interest rate 
levels.  
Notwithstanding the above, the average term and the duration of the issue of some Bonds in this 
Prospectus could be modified in relation to those initially estimated in section II.11. in the event that the 
Rate of Prepayment of the Shares and Certificates, varies. 
It is the opinion of the Sociedad Gestora that there is no historical public information at the moment 
regarding prepayment amortisation to be able to elaborate predictions in both half and long term 
regarding the behaviour of the Prepayment Amortisation Rates of the mortgage portfolios. Nevertheless, 
the Sociedad Gestora informs monthly, through various channels, for instance its web page (www.tda-
sgft.com) of the Rates of Prepayment of each one of the Funds it manages. Additionally, it is the opinion 
of the Sociedad Gestora that in following years there will be available relevant information regarding the

behaviour of this variable. Nevertheless, it must be taken into account that the market, as indicated in the 
previous section, has suffered profound modifications in recent years, and this factor does not 
recommend, for the time being, the elaboration of predictions based on the extrapolation of available data 
in the last years; furthermore these data are scarce and limited in time, and it is not possible to assign 
them any representative value. In any event, those investors interested can consult the information that 
this and other Sociedades Gestoras publish regularly on the Mortgage Backed Securities Funds and Asset 
Backed Securities Funds that they manage.
