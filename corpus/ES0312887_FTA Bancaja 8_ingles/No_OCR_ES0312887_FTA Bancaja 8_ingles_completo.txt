between Series A, B, C and D, and in an amount equal to the Available Funds applied on each Payment Date,

Issue in the Early Liquidation Events and subject to the requirements established in section III.7.1 of this 
Offering Circular. 
 
Final Maturity Date. 
The Final Maturity Date and consequently the final amortisation of the Bonds is October 25, 2037 or the

Jurisdiction in the event of litigation. 
The constitution of the Fund, the Bond issue and the agreements for transactions hedging financial risks and 
the rendering of services to be entered into by the Management Company on behalf of the Fund shall be 
subject to Spanish Law. In any event, the Deed of Constitution and the transaction agreements to be entered 
into on behalf of the Fund shall be governed by and construed in accordance with Spanish Laws. 
 
All matters, disagreements, actions and claims deriving from the Management Company’s constitution, 
administration and legal representation of BANCAJA 8 FONDO DE TITULIZACIÓN DE ACTIVOS, and the 
Bond Issue by the same, shall be submitted to the competent Spanish Courts and Tribunals. 
 
 
0.4 
Assets pooled in the Fund: Pass-Through Certificates. 
The Fund shall pool Pass-Through Certificates wholly issued by BANCAJA on Mortgage Loans owned by 
BANCAJA granted by BANCAJA to individuals with real estate mortgage security on finished homes located 
within Spanish territory, both directly and through subrogations of financing granted to developers.  
 
The Deed of Constitution shall perfect the issue by BANCAJA of the Pass-Through Certificates and their 
subscription by the Fund, represented by the Management Company, making up an as yet indeterminate 
number whose total principal or capital shall be equal to or slightly in excess of EUR 1,650,000,000.00. 
 
The Pass-Through Certificates will be issued on the Mortgage Loans as established in Act 2/1981 and 
additional provision five of Act 3/1994, as worded by article 18 of Act 44/2002, because (i) the principal yet to 
be repaid on certain mortgage loans is in excess of 80 percent of the appraisal value of the mortgaged 
property, and because (ii) there is no satisfactory evidence that the selected mortgage loans have all been 
granted in order to finance the acquisition, building or renovation of homes, although the Mortgage Loans are 
listed for any of those purposes in the Originator’s databases, or (iii) where earlier mortgages exist, that the 
latter have not been struck off the relevant Land Registry, despite having been wholly repaid. (Section 
IV.2.1.10) describes the potential legal implications of that).

notwithstanding the provisions of rules 2 and 3 below for pro rata amortisation of the different Series.

Payment Date as provided for in rule 2 above, the Available Funds for Amortisation of Series A, B, C 
and D shall also be applied to amortising Series B and/or Series C and/or Series D in such a way that 
the ratio of the Outstanding Principal Balance of Series B or of Series C or of Series D to the sum of 
the Outstanding Principal Balance of Series A, B, C and D is respectively kept at 7.297% or 1.806% or

0.6.2.3 
Liquidation Priority of Payments. 
The Management Company shall proceed to liquidate the Fund on the Payment Date on which that occurs in 
accordance with the provisions of section III.7 of the Offering Circular, by applying the available funds to the 
following items (the “Liquidation Available Funds”): (i) the Available Funds, (ii) the amounts obtained by the 
Fund from time to time upon disposing of the assets in connection with the Pass-Through Certificates 
remaining and, as the case may be, (iii) the amount drawn under a credit facility to be arranged and fully 
assigned to the final amortisation of the Series A, B, C and D Bonds, in accordance with the provisions of 
section III.7.1, in the following priority of payments (the “Liquidation Priority of Payments”): 
 
1.

Payment of the Fund’s properly supported taxes and ordinary and extraordinary expenses, whether or not 
they were disbursed by the Management Company, including the management fee due to the latter, and 
all other expenses and service fees, including those derived from the Paying Agent Agreement. Only 
expenses prepaid or disbursed on the Fund’s behalf by and amounts reimbursable to the Servicer in 
relation to the Mortgage Loans, provided they are all properly supported, and the servicing fee if 
BANCAJA shall have been replaced as Servicer shall be made to the Servicer under the Servicing 
Agreement in this priority. 
3. 
Payment of amounts, if any, due upon termination of the Interest Swaps and, only in the event of 
termination of those Agreements following a breach by the Fund or because the Fund is the party affected

Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores may have any legal effect whatsoever or be taken into account with respect to the Bond Issue. 
 
 
 
 
11
by objective circumstances subsequently occurring, payment of the settlement payment amounts payable 
by the Fund.  
4. 
Payment of interest due on the Series A Bonds. 
5. 
Repayment of Series A Bond principal. 
6. 
Payment of interest due on the Series B Bonds. 
7. 
Repayment of Series B Bond principal. 
8. 
Payment of interest due on the Series C Bonds. 
9. 
Repayment of Series C Bond principal. 
10. Payment of interest due on the Series D Bonds. 
11. Repayment of Series D Bond principal. 
12. Payment of interest due on the Series E Bonds. 
13. Repayment of Series E Bond principal.

17. Payment of the Financial Intermediation Margin. 
Where receivables for different items exist in a same priority of payments on the Final Maturity Date or on the 
Payment Date on which there is an Early Liquidation and the Liquidation Available Funds are not sufficient to 
settle the amounts due under all of them, the application of the remaining Liquidation Available Funds shall be 
prorated among the amounts payable under each such item, and the amount applied to each item shall be 
distributed in the priority in which the accounts payable fall due. 
 
 
0.7 
Liquidation and termination of the Fund. 
Termination of the Fund. 
The Fund shall terminate in the following events: 
(i) 
Upon the Pass-Through Certificates pooled therein being fully amortised. 
(ii) 
Upon the Bonds issued being fully amortised. 
(iii) Upon the Early Liquidation procedure ending, subject to the requirements and procedures contained in 
section III.7.1 of the Offering Circular. 
(iv) At all events, upon the Fund being finally liquidated on the Final Maturity Date (October 25, 2037 or the 
following Business Day if that is not a Business Day). 
(v) 
Upon the Fund constitution terminating in the event that Moody’s or Fitch should not confirm any of the 
assigned provisional ratings as final ratings by the start of the Subscription Period. 
 
 
0.8 
Risks inherent in the Bonds.   
a) 
Risk of default on the Mortgage Loans.  
The holders of the Bonds issued by the Fund shall bear the risk of default on the Mortgage Loans pooled 
therein by means of the issue of the Pass-Through Certificates.  
 
b) 
Mortgage Loan prepayment risk.  
There will be an early amortisation of the Pass-Through Certificates pooled in the Fund when the 
Mortgage Loan Obligors prepay the portion of principal pending repayment or in the event that 
BANCAJA should be substituted in the relevant Mortgage Loans by any other financial institution 
licensed to do so or in any other event having the same effect.

Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores may have any legal effect whatsoever or be taken into account with respect to the Bond Issue. 
 
 
 
 
12
 
 
That early amortisation risk shall pass quarterly on each Payment Date to the Bondholders by the partial 
amortisation of the Bonds.  
 
c) 
Limited Hedging. 
A high level of delinquency of the Mortgage Loans might reduce or indeed exhaust the limited hedging 
against Mortgage Loan portfolio losses that the Series A, B, C and D Bonds have as a result of the 
existence of the credit enhancement transactions described in section V.3 of this Offering Circular. 
Moreover, the degree of subordination in payment of interest and repayment of principal between the 
Bonds in the different Series, derived from the Fund Priority of Payments and Liquidation Priority of 
Payments, is a mechanism for distinctly hedging the different Series. 
 
d)  
Liquidity.  
There is no assurance that the Bonds will be traded on the market with a minimum frequency or volume. 
 
 
There is no undertaking that any institution will be involved in secondary trading, giving the Bonds 
liquidity by offering consideration. 
 
The Fund may in no event repurchase the Bonds from Bondholders. Nevertheless, the Bonds may be 
fully subject to early amortisation in the event of Early Liquidation of the Fund. 
 
e) 
Yield.  
Mortgage Loan repayment performance is influenced by a number of economic and social factors such 
as market interest rates, the Obligors’ employment and economic status and the general level of 
economic activity, preventing their predictability. 
 
Calculation of the internal rate of return, average life and duration of the Bonds in each Series is subject, 
inter alia, to assumed Mortgage Loan prepayment and delinquency rates that may not be fulfilled, and to 
future market interest rates, given the floating nature of the nominal interest rate of each Series. 
 
f) 
Late-payment interest. 
Late payment of interest or repayment of principal to the Bondholders shall under no circumstances 
result in late-payment interest accruing to their favour. 
 
 
0.9 
No right of action. 
The Bondholders and the remaining creditors of the Fund shall have no recourse whatsoever against Obligors 
who may have defaulted on their Mortgage Loan payment obligations. Any such rights shall lie with the 
Management Company, representing the Fund holding the Pass-Through Certificates. 
 
The Bondholders and the remaining creditors of the Fund shall have no recourse whatsoever against the Fund 
or against the Management Company in the event of non-payment of amounts due by the Fund resulting from 
the existence of default or early amortisation or prepayment of the Pass-Through Certificates, a breach by the 
counterparties to the transactions entered into for and on behalf of the Fund, or shortfall of the financial 
hedging transactions for servicing the Bonds in each Series.  
 
The Bondholders and the remaining creditors of the Fund shall have no recourse against the Management 
Company other than as derived from a breach of its duties.

Supervisory Bodies. 
This full Offering Circular regarding the constitution of the Fund and issue of the Bonds has been entered in 
the Official Registers of the CNMV on [FVCNMV]. 
 
Registration of the Offering Circular by the CNMV shall not imply recommending subscription for or purchase 
of the securities referred to therein, nor indeed any statement whatsoever as to the solvency of the issuer or 
yield or quality of the issued or offered securities; it shall only imply a recognition that the Offering Circular 
contains all the information required by the rules fixing its contents and shall at no event determine that the 
CNMV is liable for any inaccuracy of the information therein contained. 
 
This Offering Circular conforms to the contents established in Royal Decree 926/1998 and Royal Decree 
291/1992, March 27, on issues and public offerings for the sale of securities, in accordance with the authority 
laid down in the single Transitional Provision of Royal Decree 5/2005, March 11, on urgent measures for

Audit report on the assets securitised through the Fund. 
Appendix V to this Offering Circular contains the audit report on a selection of portfolio mortgage loans of 
BANCAJA, which shall mostly be assigned to the Fund, by means of the issue of the Pass-Through

That audit was made using sampling techniques consisting of analysing a number of loans fewer (sample) 
than the full selection of loans (population), allowing a conclusion to be arrived at regarding that population. 
The verification deals with a number of both quantitative and qualitative attributes regarding the sample 
mortgage loans and specifically regarding: nature of the loan and lender, identification of the borrower, date of 
origination, date of maturity, initial amount, current balance, floating interest rate and 1-year Mibor or Euribor 
reference rate, spread, interest rate applied, arrears in payment, appraisal value, current loan-to-value ratio, 
address of the mortgaged property, mortgage security and damage insurance. Loans in respect of which 
errors are detected in verifying the sample shall not be included by BANCAJA for issuing the Pass-Through 
Certificates.

The following is the meaning ascribed by Moody’s to the long- and short-term ratings used in this Offering 
Circular and the intermediates between them. 
 
Long-Term 
Aaa 
Bonds that are rated Aaa are judged to be of the best quality and carry the smallest degree of 
investment risk. Interest payments are protected by a large or by an exceptionally stable margin and 
principal collection is secure. While the various protective elements are likely to change, such changes 
are unlikely to impair the fundamentally strong position of such issues.  
Aa 
Bonds rated Aa are judged to be of high quality by all standards. Together with the Aaa group they 
comprise what are generally known as high grade bonds. They are rated lower than best bonds 
because margins of protection may not be as large. Fluctuation of protective elements may be of 
greater amplitude or there may be other elements present that make the long-term risks appear 
somewhat larger than in Aaa securities. 
A 
Bonds that are rated A possess many favourable investment attributes and are to be considered as 
upper medium grade obligations. Factors giving security to principal and interest collection are 
adequate, but elements may be present that suggest a susceptibility to impairment some time in the 
future. 
Baa 
Bonds that are rated Baa are considered as medium grade obligations, i.e., they are neither highly 
protected nor poorly secured. Interest payments and principal security appear adequate for the present 
but certain protective elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great 
length of time. Such bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in fact have speculative 
characteristics as well.  


 This is a Certified Translation into English of the Spanish Offering Circular. No document other than the Spanish Offering Circular approved by the 
Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores may have any legal effect whatsoever or be taken into account with respect to the Bond Issue. 
 
 
 
 
18
Ba 
Bonds that are rated Ba are judged to have speculative elements; their future cannot be considered as 
well assured. Often the protection of interest and principal payments may be very moderate, and 
thereby not well safeguarded during both good and bad times over the future. Uncertainty of position 
characterizes bonds in this class. 
Caa 
Bonds that are rated Caa are of poor standing. Such issues may be in default or there may be present 
elements of danger with respect to principal and interest collection. 
 
Moody’s applies numerical modifiers 1, 2, and 3 in each long-term rating category from Aa through Caa, 
inclusive. Modifier 1 indicates that the security ranks in the higher end of its rating category; modifier 2 
indicates a mid-range ranking; and modifier 3 indicates a ranking in the lower end.

The following is the meaning ascribed by Fitch to the long- and short-term ratings used in this Offering Circular and 
the intermediates between them. 
Long-Term 
AAA Highest credit quality. “AAA” ratings denote the lowest expectation of credit risk. They are assigned 
only in case of exceptionally strong capacity for timely payment of principal and interest on financial 
commitments. This capacity is highly unlikely to be adversely affected by foreseeable events. 
AA 
Very high credit quality. “AA” ratings denote a very low expectation of credit risk. They indicate very 
strong capacity for timely payment of principal and interest on financial commitments. This capacity is 
not significantly vulnerable to foreseeable events 
A 
High credit quality. “A” ratings denote a low expectation of credit risk. The capacity for timely payment 
of principal and interest on financial commitments is considered strong. This capacity may, 
nevertheless, be more vulnerable to changes in circumstances and in economic conditions than is the 
case for higher ratings. 


 This is a Certified Translation into English of the Spanish Offering Circular. No document other than the Spanish Offering Circular approved by the 
Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores may have any legal effect whatsoever or be taken into account with respect to the Bond Issue. 
 
 
 
 
19
BBB Good credit quality. “BBB” ratings indicate that there is currently a low expectation of credit risk. The 
capacity for timely payment of principal and interest on financial commitments is considered adequate, 
but adverse changes in circumstances and in economic conditions are more likely to impair this 
capacity. This is the lowest investment-grade category. 
BB 
This is the highest rating within the “speculative grade” category. “BB” ratings indicate that there is a 
possibility of credit risk developing, particularly as the result of adverse economic change over time. 
 
Short-Term 
F1 
Highest credit quality. Indicates the strongest capacity for timely payment of financial commitments; 
may have an added “+” to denote any exceptionally strong credit feature. 
 
Fitch may append “+” or “-” to a rating to denote relative status within major rating categories. Such suffixes 
are not added to the “AAA” long-term rating category, to categories below “CCC”, or to short-term ratings other 
than “F1”. 
 
Rating considerations. 
The ratings assigned to each of the Bond Series by Moody’s measure the expected loss before the Final 
Maturity Date. In Moody’s opinion, the structure allows timely payment of interest and payment of principal 
during the life of the transaction and, in any event, before the Final Maturity Date.  
 
The ratings assigned to the A, B, C and D Bond Series by Fitch measure the Fund’s ability to meet payments 
of interest as they fall due on each set Payment Date and repayment of the principal throughout the life of the 
transaction and, in any event, before the Final Maturity Date, in accordance with the terms stipulated for each 
Series in the Offering Circular and in the Deed of Constitution allowing Series B, C and D Bond interest 
payment to be deferred in certain circumstances. This means that interest on these Bonds might not be 
received for a period of time if the circumstances established for deferment should occur, although such 
deferment shall not be an event of default on the Bonds.  
 
The rating takes into account the structure of the Bond Issue, the legal aspects thereof and of the issuing 
Fund, the characteristics of the mortgage loans selected to be assigned to the Fund by means of the issue of 
the Pass-Through Certificates and the regularity and continuity of the operating flows.   
 
The Rating Agencies’ ratings are not an assessment of the likelihood of Obligors prepaying principal, nor 
indeed of the extent to which such prepayments differ from what was originally forecast. The ratings are not by 
any means a rating of the level of actuarial performance. 
 
The ratings assigned, and any revision or suspension of the ratings:  
 
(i) are assigned by the Rating Agencies based on manifold information received with respect to which they 
give no assurance, nor even as to their accuracy or wholeness, wherefore the Rating Agencies may in no 
event be deemed to be responsible therefor; and  
 
(ii) are not and cannot therefore be howsoever construed as an invitation, recommendation or encouragement 
for investors to proceed to carry out any transaction whatsoever on the Bonds and, in particular, acquire, 
keep, charge or sell those Bonds.  
 
The Rating Agencies may revise, suspend or withdraw the final ratings assigned at any time, based on any 
information that may come to their notice. Those events, which shall not constitute early liquidation events of 
the Fund, shall forthwith be notified to both the CNMV and the Bondholders, in accordance with the provisions 
of section III.4.2. 
 
In carrying on the rating process, the Rating Agencies rely on the accuracy and wholeness of the information 
provided by BANCAJA, the Management Company, auditors, lawyers and other experts.

Undertakings by the Management Company. 
The Management Company, on behalf of the Fund, agrees to report regularly to the Rating Agencies as to the 
status of the Fund and the performance of the Mortgage Loans in order that they can monitor the rating of the 
Bonds. It shall also report when reasonably required to do so and in any event whenever there is a change in 
the conditions of the Fund, in the agreements entered into by the Fund through its Management Company or 
in the parties concerned. 
 
 
II.4 
Nature and denomination of the Bonds offered. 
The face value of the issue of asset-backed bonds (the “Bond Issue” and the “Bonds”) totals EUR one billion 
six hundred and eighty million one hundred thousand (1,680,100,000.00) and consists of sixteen thousand 
eight hundred and one (16,801) Bonds pooled in five Series (Series A, Series B, Series C, Series D and 
Series E) as detailed in section II.6 below. 
 
II.4.1 
Legal system of the Bonds, specifying the procedures guaranteeing the certainty and effectiveness of 
the rights of their first and subsequent holders.  
The constitution of and the Bond Issue by the Fund are carried out pursuant to Royal Decree 926/1998 and 
Act 19/1992 failing a provision in Royal Decree 926/1998 and to the extent applicable, and pursuant to Act 
3/1994, as worded by article 18 of Act 44/2002. 
 
The Bonds legally qualify as marketable fixed-income securities with an explicit yield and are subject to the 
system prescribed in the Securities Market Act and implementing regulations.  
 
 
As provided in section II.5 of this Chapter, the Bonds shall be represented by means of book entries. The 
Bondholders will be identified as such when entered in the accounting record kept by Iberclear, and the 
relevant member may issue certificates of title when so requested by the Bondholder and at the Bondholder’s 
expense; the provisions of Title I, Chapter I, section four of the Book Entries and Stock Exchange Transaction 
Clearing and Settlement Royal Decree 116/1992, February 14, (“Royal Decree 116/1992”) will apply in this 
connection.  
 
The Bonds may be freely transferred by any means admissible at Law and in accordance with the rules of the 
market on which they are traded. A transfer in the accounts will convey the ownership of each Bond. The 
effects of entering the conveyance to the transferee in the accounting record shall be the same as handing 
over the certificates and the transfer shall thereupon be enforceable on third parties. In this sense, no claim 
may be lodged against a third party acquiring the Bonds represented by book entries for valuable 
consideration from whoever has capacity to transfer the same, according to the book entries, unless he acted 
in bad faith or with gross negligence at the time of the acquisition, in accordance with article 12 of Royal 
Decree 116/1992. 
 
The Bondholders are bound in respect of interest payment and principal repayment of the Bonds in each 
Series by the Fund Priority of Payments and Liquidation Priority of Payments. 
 
II.4.2 
Implications between the schedule of principal and interest payments on the Bonds and the cash 
flows of the assets securitised through the Fund.  
In order to cover timing differences between the scheduled flows of repayment of principal and interest on the 
Mortgage Loans and on the Bonds in each Series, the Management Company, on behalf of the Fund, shall 
enter into a Guaranteed Interest Rate Account (Treasury Account) Agreement with BANCAJA whereby the 
amounts received by the Fund from the Mortgage Loans, as both repayment of principal and interest, as well 
as the amounts referred to in section V.3.1 of the Offering Circular, will be invested until the following Bond 
Payment Date. Furthermore, the Fund has other financial hedging transactions covering up to a limit the risk 
of shortfall of the Fund’s resources to service the Bonds and which have been deemed sufficient by the Rating 
Agencies to assign each Bond Series the rating referred to in section II.3 of this Offering Circular.

21
II.4.3 
Other considerations on the risks that might affect servicing of the Bonds. 
a) Risk of default on the Mortgage Loans. 
The holders of the Bonds issued by the Fund shall bear the risk of default on the Mortgage Loans pooled 
therein by means of the issue of the Pass-Through Certificates. 
 
BANCAJA shall have no liability whatsoever for the Obligors’ default of principal, interest or any other 
amount they may owe under the Mortgage Loans. Under article 348 of the Commercial Code, BANCAJA is 
liable to the Fund exclusively for the existence and lawfulness of the Mortgage Loans on the terms and 
conditions declared in the Deed of Constitution, and for the personality with which the assignment is made. 
BANCAJA will have no liability whatsoever to directly or indirectly guarantee that the transaction will be 
properly performed nor give any guarantees or security, nor indeed agree to repurchase the Pass-Through 
Certificates, other than where any of these or of the underlying Mortgage Loans fail to conform upon the 
Fund being constituted to the representations contained in section IV.1.1 of this Offering Circular. 
 
The Bonds issued by the Fund neither represent nor constitute an obligation of BANCAJA or the 
Management Company. No other guarantees have been granted by any public or private organisation 
whatsoever, including BANCAJA, the Management Company and any of their affiliated or associated 
companies. 
 
b) Mortgage Loan prepayment risk. 
There will be an early amortisation of the Pass-Through Certificates pooled in the Fund when the 
Mortgage Loan Obligors prepay the portion of principal pending repayment, on the terms set in each of the 
Mortgage Loan documents. Similarly, there will be a full amortisation of the Pass-Through Certificates in 
the event that BANCAJA should be substituted in the relevant Mortgage Loans by any other financial 
institution licensed to do so, subject to the current wording of Mortgage Loan Subrogation and Amendment 
Act 2/1994, March 30 (“Act 2/1994”) or in any other event having the same effect. 
 
That prepayment risk shall pass quarterly on each Payment Date to the Bondholders by the partial 
amortisation of the Bonds, in accordance with the provisions of section II.11 of this Offering Circular. 
  
c) Limited Hedging. 
An investment in the Bonds may be affected, among other circumstances, by a downturn in general 
economic conditions adversely affecting payments of the Mortgage Loans backing the Bond Issue of the 
Fund. A high level of delinquency of the Mortgage Loans might reduce or indeed exhaust the limited 
hedging against Mortgage Loan portfolio losses that the Series A, B, C and D Bonds have as a result of 
the existence of the credit enhancement transactions described in section V.3 of this Offering Circular. 
Moreover, the degree of subordination in payment of interest and repayment of principal between the 
Bonds in the different Series derived from their position in the application of the Available Funds and from 
the rules for Distribution of Available Funds for Amortisation of Series A, B, C and D in the Fund Priority of 
Payments and Liquidation Priority of Payments, is a mechanism for distinctly hedging the different Series. 
 
d) Liquidity. 
There is no assurance that the Bonds will be traded on the market with a minimum frequency or volume. 
 
There is no undertaking that any institution will be involved in secondary trading, giving the Bonds liquidity 
by offering consideration. 
 
The Fund may in no event repurchase the Bonds from Bondholders. Nevertheless, the Bonds may be fully 
subject to early amortisation in the event of Early Liquidation of the Fund, on the terms established in 
section III.7.1 of this Offering Circular. 
 
e) Yield. 
Mortgage Loan repayment performance is influenced by a number of economic and social factors such as 
market interest rates, the Obligors’ employment and economic status and the general level of economic 
activity, preventing their predictability.

22
Calculation of the internal rate of return, average life and duration of the Bonds in each Series contained in 
the Offering Circular is subject, inter alia, to assumed Mortgage Loan prepayment and delinquency rates 
that may not be fulfilled, and to future market interest rates, given the floating nature of the nominal interest 
rate of each Series. 
 
f) Late-payment interest. 
Late payment of interest or repayment of principal to the Bondholders shall under no circumstances result 
in late-payment interest accruing to their favour. 
 
 
II.5 
Form of representation and name and place of business of the institution in charge of the accounting 
record. 
The Bonds issued by the Fund will be exclusively represented by means of book entries, and will become 
such Bonds when entered at Iberclear, the institution in charge of the accounting record, in accordance with 
article 11 of Royal Decree 116/1992. In this connection, and for the record, the Deed of Constitution shall have 
the effects prescribed by article 6 of the Securities Market Act. 
 
Iberclear shall be the institution designated in the Deed of Constitution to account for the Bonds in order for 
the Bonds to be cleared and settled in accordance with the operating rules regarding securities listed on the 
AIAF, and represented by book entries, established now or henceforth by Iberclear or AIAF. Such designation 
shall be entered in the Official Registers of the CNMV.  
 
Bondholders shall be identified as such when entered in the accounting record kept by the members of 
Iberclear.

Payment of interest and repayment of principal on the Series B Bonds is deferred with respect to the Series A 
Bonds, as provided in the Fund Priority of Payments and Liquidation Priority of Payments.  
 
Payment of interest and repayment of principal on the Series C Bonds is deferred with respect to the Series A 
and the Series B Bonds, as provided in the Fund Priority of Payments and Liquidation Priority of Payments.

Subscribing for or holding Bonds in one Series does not imply subscribing for or holding Bonds in the other 
Series. 
 
 
II.7 
Face and actual amounts of each Bond. 
The Bonds are issued at 100 percent of their face value. The issue price of the Bonds in each of Series A, B, 
C, D and E shall be EUR one hundred thousand (100,000) per Bond, clear of taxes and subscription costs for 
the subscriber through the Fund. 
 
The expenses and taxes attaching to the Bond issue shall be borne by the Fund. 
 
 
II.8 
Fees and related expenses of every description that must be borne by the investors upon subscribing 
for the Bonds. 
The Fund, as Bond issuer, shall neither shift to nor charge the investor any expense item whatsoever for 
subscribing for the Bonds. The issue price detailed in section II.7 above is clear of taxes and subscription 
costs for the subscriber through the Fund. 
 
 
II.9 
Fees borne by the Bondholders. 
The expenses of including and excluding the Bond Issue in and from the accounting record of Iberclear shall 
be borne by the Fund and may not be shifted to the Bondholders. Iberclear charges no fee whatsoever for 
maintaining a balance. 
 
In accordance with the laws in force for the time being, the members of Iberclear may nevertheless establish 
such fees and expenses to be charged to the Bondholder, for managing securities, as they may freely 
determine, and duly notified to the Bank of Spain or the CNMV, being their supervisory bodies. 
 
 
II.10

The Bonds in each Series shall accrue a yearly nominal interest, from the Closing Date until they mature fully, 
variable and payable quarterly, which shall be the result of applying the policies established hereinafter for 
each of the Series. 
 
The resultant yearly nominal interest rate (the “Nominal Interest Rate”) for each of the Series shall be 
payable by Interest Accrual Periods in arrears on each Payment Date on the Outstanding Principal Balance of 
the Bonds in each Series, provided that the Fund has sufficient liquidity in the Priority of Payments or 
Liquidation the Priority of Payments, as the case may be.  
 
The withholdings, payments on account, contributions and taxes established or to be established in the future 
on the principal, interest or return of the Bonds, shall be borne exclusively by the Bondholders, and their

24
II.10.1.1  
Interest Accrual.  
For interest accrual purposes, the duration of each Bond Series shall be divided into successive interest 
accrual periods (“Interest Accrual Periods”) comprising the exact number of days elapsed between every 
two consecutive Payment Dates, each Interest Accrual Period including the beginning Payment Date but not 
including the ending Payment Date. Exceptionally, the duration of the first Interest Accrual Period shall be 
equivalent to the days elapsed between the Closing Date, April 27, 2005, inclusive, and the first Payment 
Date, to wit July 26, 2005 because July 25, 2005 is not a Business Day, exclusive.  
 
The nominal interest rate shall accrue on the exact number of days in each Interest Accrual Period for which it 
was determined, calculated based upon a 360-day year. 
 
II.10.1.2 
Nominal Interest Rate. 
The Nominal Interest Rate applicable to each of the Series determined for each Interest Accrual Period shall 
be the result of adding:  
(i) 
the Reference Rate as established in the following paragraph, and  
(ii)  a margin for each Series as follows: 
• Series A: 
margin ranging between 0.05% and 0.12%, both inclusive. 
• Series B: 
margin ranging between 0.15% and 0.35%, both inclusive. 
• Series C: 
margin ranging between 0.38% and 0.80%, both inclusive. 
• Series D: 
margin ranging between 1.60% and 2.60%, both inclusive. 
• Series E: 
margin ranging between 3.50% and 4.00%, both inclusive. 
 
The margin applicable to each of the Series, expressed as a percentage, shall be determined with one 
accord among the Lead Managers and notified in writing to the Management Company by 10am (CET 
time) on the day of the Subscription Period (April 25, 2005). 
 
Failing an agreement, the Management Company shall fix the specific margin for the Series in respect of 
which no margin was agreed, as follows: 
 
• Series A: 
0.12% margin. 
• Series B: 
0.35% margin. 
• Series C: 
0.80% margin. 
• Series D: 
2.60% margin. 
• Series E: 
4.00% margin. 
 
The final margins applicable to each of the Series fixed shall be notified by the Management Company 
by the start of the Subscription Period to the Lead Managers and to the Underwriters and Placement 
Agents, to be reported to investors interested in subscribing for the Bonds. The Management Company 
will also notify this to the CNMV as information in addition to this Offering Circular. The final margin 
applicable to each of the Series shall be set down on the notarial certificate recording payment of the 
Bond Issue. 
 
The resultant Nominal Interest Rate shall be expressed as a percentage rounded to the nearest thousandth of a 
percentage point or rounded up to the nearest point where the differences of rounding up or down to the 
nearest thousandths are identical. 
  
II.10.1.3 
Reference Rate and determining the same. 
The reference rate (the “Reference Rate”) for determining the nominal interest rate applicable to each of the 
Bond Series is as follows: 
i) Other than for the first Interest Accrual Period, Euribor, “Euro InterBank Offered Rate”, calculated and 
distributed by the BRIDGE financial information system under an FBE (“Federation Bancaire de l’Union 
Europeene”) mandate, with a three- (3-) month maturity, fixed at 11am (CET time “Central European 
Time”) on the Interest Rate Fixing Date described below, which is currently published on electronic page 
EURIBOR01 supplied by Reuters, and on electronic page 248 supplied by Dow Jones Markets (Bridge 
Telerate), or any other replacement page in providing these services.

Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores may have any legal effect whatsoever or be taken into account with respect to the Bond Issue. 
 
 
 
 
25
 
Exceptionally, the Reference Rate for the first Interest Accrual Period shall be the three- (3-) month Euribor 
rate, fixed at 11am (CET time) on the second Business Day preceding the Closing Date. 
 
The Euribor rate is currently the term interbank deposit offered rate in euros calculated as the daily average of 
the quotations supplied for fifteen maturity periods by a panel consisting of 57 Banks, from among the most 
active banks in the Euro zone. The rate is quoted based on a count of the actual days to maturity and a 360-
day year, and is fixed at 11am (CET time), accurate to three (3) decimal places. 
 
The Euribor rate definitions approved by the FBE and the Financial Markets Association (ACI) 
supplementing the current Euribor rate definition shall be considered introduced for the purpose of the 
Euribor Reference Rate without having to amend the present terms of the Reference Rate or have the 
Management Company notify the Bondholders. 
 
ii) In the event that the Euribor rate established in paragraph (i) above should not be available or be 
impossible to obtain, the substitute Reference Rate shall be the interest rate resulting from finding the 
simple arithmetic mean of the interbank offered interest rates for non-transferable deposit transactions in 
euros with a three- (3-) month maturity in an amount equivalent to the Outstanding Principal Balance of the 
Bond Issue, declared by four (4) prime banks in the Euro zone, following a simultaneous request to the 
headquarters of each of them made by the Paying Agent after and around 11am (CET time) on the 
Interest Rate Fixing Date. 
 
Exceptionally, the substitute Reference Rate for the first Interest Accrual Period shall be the rate resulting 
from the straight-line interpolation between the interest rate resulting from finding the simple arithmetic 
mean of the interbank offered interest rates for non-transferable deposit transactions in euros with a three- 
(3-) month maturity and the interest rate resulting from finding the simple arithmetic mean of the interbank 
offered interest rates for non-transferable deposit transactions in euros with a four- (4-) month maturity, 
both in an amount equivalent to the face amount of the Bond Issue, declared by the banks in accordance 
with the provisions of paragraph one above, following a simultaneous request to the headquarters of each 
of them made by the Paying Agent after and around 11am (CET time) on the second Business Day 
preceding the Closing Date. 
 
The substitute Reference Rate shall be expressed as a percentage rounded to the nearest thousandth of a 
percentage point or rounded up to the nearest point where the differences of rounding up or down to the 
nearest thousandths are identical. 
 
In the event that it should be impossible to apply the above substitute Reference Rate, due to the failure by 
any or several of the banks to provide written quotations as provided for in paragraph one of this section, 
the interest rate resulting from applying the simple arithmetic mean of the interest rates declared by at 
least two of the other banks shall be applicable. 
 
iii) If the rates established in paragraphs i) and ii) above should not be available or be impossible to obtain, 
the last Reference Rate or substitute Reference Rate applied to the last Interest Accrual Period shall 
apply, and so on for successive Interest Accrual Periods whilst matters remain the same. 
 
On each of the Interest Rate Fixing Dates, the Paying Agent shall notify the Management Company of the 
Reference Rate determined in accordance with paragraphs i) and ii) above. The Management Company shall 
keep the listings and supporting documents on which the Paying Agent shall notify it the Reference Rate 
determined. 
 
II.10.1.4 
Interest Rate Fixing Date. 
The Nominal Interest Rate applicable to each of the Bond Series for every Interest Accrual Period shall be 
determined by the Management Company, for and on behalf of the Fund, as provided in sections II.10.1.2 and 
II.10.1.3 above, on the second Business Day before each Payment Date (the “Interest Rate Fixing Date”) 
and will apply for the following Interest Accrual Period. 
 
Exceptionally, the Management Company shall determine the Nominal Interest Rate of the Bonds in each of 
the Series for the first Interest Accrual Period as provided in sections II.10.1.2 and II.10.1.3 above, on the 
second Business Day preceding the Closing Date, and shall notify the same in writing by the start of the

Subscription Period to the Lead Managers and to the Underwriters and Placement Agents in order to be 
reported to investors interested in subscribing for the Bonds. The Management Company will also notify this to 
the CNMV, the Paying Agent, the AIAF and Iberclear. 
 
The Nominal Interest Rates determined for each of the Bond Series for successive Interest Accrual Periods 
shall be communicated to the Bondholders within the time period and in the manner for which provision is 
made in sections III.4.2.a) and c). 
 
II.10.1.5 
Formula for calculating interest. 
Interest settlement for the Bonds in each of the Series, payable on each Payment Date for each Interest 
Accrual Period, shall be calculated in accordance with the following formula:

Interest on the Bonds in each of the Series will be paid until they are finally amortised by Interest Accrual 
Periods in arrears on January 25, April 25, July 25 or October 25 in each year, or the following Business Day if

Period will accrue until said first Business Day, not inclusive. 
 
The first interest Payment Date for the Bonds in each of the Series shall be July 26, 2005 because July 25, 
2005 is not a Business Day, and interest will accrue at the applicable Nominal Interest Rate between the 
Closing Date, April 27, 2005, inclusive, and July 26, 2005, exclusive. 
 
For the purposes of the Bond Issue, business days (“Business Days”) shall be deemed to be all days other

accrued by the Bonds in any of the Series, in the Priority of Payments, the amounts that the Bondholders 
should not have received shall be accumulated on the following Payment Date to the interest on the Series 
proper that, as the case may be, should be paid on that same Payment Date, and will be paid in the Priority of 
Payments and applied by order of maturity if it should be impossible once again not to pay the same fully due 
to a shortage of Available Funds.  
 
Deferred interest amounts shall accrue for the holders an interest equivalent to that applied to the Bonds in 
their respective Series during the Interest Accrual Period(s) until the Payment Date on which they are paid, 
without late-payment interest and without this entailing a capitalisation of the debt. 
 
The Fund, through its Management Company, may not defer Bond interest payment beyond the Final Maturity 
Date, October 25, 2037, or the following Business Day if that is not a Business Day.

Specific characteristics of the Amortisation of each of the Bond Series. 
II.11.2.1 
Amortisation of Series A Bonds. 
Series A Bond principal shall be amortised by partial amortisation on each of the Payment Dates after their 
amortisation begins until their total face amount has been fully amortised, in an amount equal to the Available

accordance with the rules for Distribution of Available Funds for Amortisation between Series A, B, C and D 
contained in sections II.11.3.5 and V.4.2.2.2., pro rated between the Bonds in Series A proper by reducing the 
face amount of each Series A Bond. 
 
The first partial amortisation of Series A Bonds shall occur on the first Payment Date (July 26, 2005 because 
July 25, 2005 is not a Business Day). 
 
The final amortisation of the Series A Bonds shall occur on the Final Maturity Date (October 25, 2037 or the 
following Business Day if that is not a Business Day), notwithstanding the partial amortisation for which 
provision is made, and the fact that the Management Company may, for and on behalf of the Fund, and in

the Final Maturity Date.

amortised. However, even if Series A has not been fully amortised, the Available Funds for Amortisation of 
Series A, B, C and D shall also be applied to amortising Series B on the Payment Date on which the 
Conditions for Pro Rata Amortisation are satisfied in accordance with the rules for Distribution of Available 
Funds for Amortisation of Series A, B, C and D, in such a way that the ratio of the Outstanding Principal 
Balance of Series B to the sum of the Outstanding Principal Balance of Series A, B, C and D is kept at 
7.297%, or higher percentage closest thereto. 
 
The final amortisation of the Series B Bonds shall occur on the Final Maturity Date (October 25, 2037 or the 
following Business Day if that is not a Business Day), notwithstanding the partial amortisation for which 
provision is made and the fact that the Management Company may, for and on behalf of the Fund, and in

face amount of each Series C Bond. 
 
The first partial amortisation of Series C Bonds shall occur once the Series A and the Series B Bonds have 
been fully amortised. However, even if Series A and B have not been fully amortised, the Available Funds for 
Amortisation of Series A, B, C and D shall also be applied to amortising Series C on the Payment Date on 
which the Conditions for Pro Rata Amortisation are satisfied in accordance with the rules for Distribution of 
Available Funds for Amortisation of Series A, B, C and D, in such a way that the ratio of the Outstanding 
Principal Balance of Series C to the sum of the Outstanding Principal Balance of Series A, B, C and D is kept

ii) 
the Outstanding Balance of Delinquent Mortgage Loans does not exceed 0.75% of the 
Outstanding Balance of Non-Doubtful Mortgage Loans. 
d) In order to amortise Series B, Series C and Series D:  
i) 
that the Required Cash Reserve on the Payment Date preceding the relevant Payment Date was 
fully provisioned; and

3. In the event that the amortisation of Series B and/or Series C and/or Series D should apply on a Payment 
Date as provided for in rule 2 above, the Available Funds for Amortisation of Series A, B, C and D shall 
also be applied to amortising Series B and/or Series C and/or Series D in such a way that the ratio of the 
Outstanding Principal Balance of Series B or of Series C or of Series D to the sum of the Outstanding 
Principal Balance of Series A, B, C and D is respectively kept at 7.297% or 1.806% or 1.600%, or higher 
percentages closest thereto. 
 
II.11.4  
Early Amortisation of the Bond Issue. 
Without prejudice to the Fund’s obligation, through its Management Company, to amortise the Bonds in each 
Series on the Final Maturity Date or the partial amortisation on each Payment Date, as established in the 
preceding paragraphs, the Management Company shall be authorised to proceed to an Early Liquidation of 
the Fund and hence an early amortisation (“Early Amortisation”), on a Payment Date, of the entire Bond 
Issue in the Early Liquidation Events and subject to the requirements established in section III.7.1 of this 
Offering Circular and subject to the Liquidation Priority of Payments. 
 
II.11.5 
Final Maturity Date. 
The Final Maturity Date and consequently the final amortisation of the Bonds is October 25, 2037 or the 
following Business Day if that is not a Business Day, without prejudice to the Management Company, for and 
on behalf of the Fund, and in accordance with the provisions of sections II.11.2 and II.11.3, proceeding to 
amortise all or some of the Series in the Bond Issue before the Final Maturity Date and subject to the 
Liquidation Priority of Payments. 
 
II.11.6 
Simple reference to the priority of Bond principal amortisation in the Fund priority of payments. 
The Amortisation Withholding amount allocated on each Payment Date to repaying principal without distinction 
between Series A, B, C and D is seventh (7th) in the application of Available Funds in the Priority of Payments 
established in section V.4.2.1.2 of this Offering Circular. 
 
Repayment of Series A, B, C and D Bond principal shall take place in accordance with the rules for 
Distribution of Available Funds for Amortisation between Series A, B, C and D in the application of Available 
Funds for Amortisation of Series A, B, C and D established in section II.11.3.5 and in section V.4.2.2.2 of this 
Offering Circular.  
 
Repayment of Series E Bond principal is thirteenth (13th) in the application of Available Funds in the Priority of 
Payments established in section V.4.2.1.2 of this Offering Circular.

II.12 
Servicing table for each Bond Series, including both interest payments and principal repayment. 
The Bond Issue will be serviced through BANCAJA as the Paying Agent. Payment of interest and amortisation 
shall be notified to the Bondholders in the events and in such advance as may be provided for each case in 
section III.4.2. Interest and amortisation shall be paid to the Bondholders by the relevant members of Iberclear 
and to the latter in turn by Iberclear, the institution responsible for the accounting record, or any other 
replacement institution. 
 
a) Bond Issue servicing tables. 
The main characteristic of the Bonds in this Issue is that their periodic amortisation depends on the 
aggregate performance of the Mortgage Loans.  
 
The average life, yield, term and final maturity of the Bonds in each Series depend on several factors, 
most significant among which are the following:  
i) The repayment schedule and system of each of the Mortgage Loans established in the relevant 
contracts. 
ii) Obligors’ capacity to prepay the Mortgage Loans in whole or in part and the aggregate repayment pace 
throughout the life of the Fund.  
iii) The floating interest rates which shall apply to each of the Mortgage Loans, which shall result in the 
amount repaid on every instalment differing. 
iv) The Obligors’ delinquency in payment of Mortgage Loan instalments. 
 
In this sense, Mortgage Loan prepayments by Obligors, subject to continual changes, and estimated in this 
Offering Circular using several performance assumptions of the future effective constant annual early 
amortisation or prepayment rate (hereinafter also “CPR”), are very significant and shall directly affect the 
pace at which the Bonds are amortised, and therefore their average life and duration.  
 
The following assumptions have been made for the above-mentioned factors in calculating the details in 
the tables contained in this section: 
• 
Mortgage Loan interest rate: 3.26% weighted average interest rate as of March 31, 2005 of the 
portfolio of selected mortgage loans which has been used for calculating the repayment and interest 
instalments of each of the selected mortgage loans; 
• 
Mortgage Loan delinquency: 0.10% of the Outstanding Balance of the Mortgage Loans, with 100% 
recoveries within 15 months of becoming delinquent; 
• 
Mortgage Loan defaults rated as bad debts: 0%;  
• 
that the Mortgage Loan prepayment rate remains constant throughout the life of the Bonds; 
• 
that the Bond Closing Date is April 27, 2005; 
• 
that the weighted average margin applicable to the Party B interest rate in each of the Interest Swap 
Agreements is above 0%; 
• 
that there is no Amortisation Deficiency, and  
• 
that there is no extension of the term of any of the Mortgage Loans as provided for in section 
IV.2.1.10.b) of this Offering Circular. 
 
Finally, the actual adjusted life of the Bonds will also depend on their floating interest rate. The following 
nominal interest rates are assumed for each Series for the Interest Accrual Periods: 
 
 
Series A 
Bonds 
Series B 
Bonds 
Series C 
Bonds 
Series D

Series E

Nominal interest rate

5.894% 
 
Assuming that the Management Company shall exercise the Early Liquidation of the Fund and Early 
Amortisation of the Bond Issue option provided in section III.7.1 of this Offering Circular when the 
Outstanding Balance of the Mortgage Loans is less than 10% of their initial amount upon the Fund being 
constituted, the average life, return (IRR), duration and final maturity of the Bonds for different CPRs, 
based on the historic performance of mortgage loans granted to individuals securitised by BANCAJA in 
recent years, shall be as follows:

Final Maturity: for each of the Series, date on which the Bonds are expected to be finally amortised, 
assuming that the Early Liquidation of the Fund and Early Amortisation of the Bond Issue option will be 
exercised when the Outstanding Balance of the Mortgage Loans is less than 10% of the initial Outstanding 
Balance. 
 
The Management Company expressly states that the debt securities servicing tables described hereinafter 
are merely theoretical and given for illustrative purposes, and represent no payment obligation 
whatsoever, on the basis that: 
 
• 
The CPRs are assumed to be constant respectively at 9.00%, 11.00% and 13.00% throughout the life 
of the Bond Issue and, as noted, actual prepayment rates change continually. 
 
• 
The Outstanding Principal Balance of the Bonds on each Payment Date and hence the interest 
payable on each such dates shall depend on the actual prepayment and delinquency and default rate 
of the Mortgage Loans. 
 
• 
The Bond nominal interest rates are assumed to be constant for each Series, from the second Interest 
Accrual Period, whereas the interest rate of all the Series is known to be variable.  
 
• 
The assumed values referred to at the beginning of this section are at all events taken for granted. 
 
• 
It is assumed that the Management Company will exercise the Early Liquidation of the Fund and 
thereby the Early Amortisation of the Bond Issue option when the Outstanding Balance of the Mortgage 
Loans is less than 10% of their initial Outstanding Balance upon the Fund being constituted, as 
provided in section III.7.1 of this Offering Circular.

In the event that the nominal interest rates applicable to each of the Series, variable quarterly, should remain 
constant throughout the life of the Bond Issue, as established on the tables contained in section II.12.a) of the 
Offering Circular, these rates would result in Internal Rates of Return (“IRR”) for the Bond subscriber in each 
of the Series as shown on the following table, given the effect of quarterly interest payment, calculated without 
considering the tax effect, and assuming at all events the values and assumptions contained in said section 
for constant prepayment rates (CPR) of 9%, 11% and 13%.

Issue at the rates of the tables contained in section II.12.a);  
b) that the assumptions mentioned in section II.12.a) are made; and  
c) that the expected Fund constitution and Bond issue expenses are deducted from the face value of the

II.19.3 
Description of the characteristics of the Management, Underwriting and Placement Agreement. 
The Management Company shall, for and on behalf of the Fund, enter into a Bond Issue Management, 
Underwriting and Placement Agreement with BANCAJA, CALYON, Sucursal en España (“CALYON”), 
DEUTSCHE BANK AG (“DEUTSCHE BANK”) and J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES LTD. (“JPMORGAN”) as

The Underwriters and Placement Agents of the Bond Issue shall take on the obligations contained in the 
Management, Underwriting and Placement Agreement, which are basically the following: 1) securing 
placement by a third-party subscription for the Bond Issue; 2) an undertaking to subscribe on their own 
account for the Bonds not subscribed for by third parties during the Subscription Period, up to the amounts of 
their respective underwriting commitments, notwithstanding the fact that BANCAJA may be bound to 
underwrite the entire Bond Issue in certain circumstances; 3) payment by the Underwriters and Placement 
Agents CALYON, DEUTSCHE BANK, JPMORGAN, DEXIA, FORTIS BANK, BANCO PASTOR and SCH to the 
Paying Agent, by 2pm (CET time) on the Closing Date, for same day value, of the face amount of the Bonds 
placed by each of them and, as the case may be, subscribed for on their own account up to their respective 
underwriting commitments, whereupon the Paying Agent shall proceed to pay to the Fund, by 3pm (CET 
time), for same day value, the amount received from the remaining Underwriters and Placement Agents, plus 
the face amount of the Bonds it shall have placed as Underwriter and Placement Agent and, as the case may 
be, subscribed for on its own account up to the face amount of the Bond Issue underwritten; 4) undertaking to 
pay late-payment interest covenanted in the agreement in the event of late payment of the amounts due; 5) 
providing subscribers with a document proving subscription; 6) providing the Paying Agent with Bond Issue 
placement dissemination control information and 7) all other aspects governing the underwriting and 
placement. 
 
The underwriting commitments of each Underwriter and Placement Agent and the underwriting and placement 
fee are specified in section II.19.1 of this Offering Circular. The Paying Agent shall pay each of the 
Underwriters and Payment Agents on the Closing Date the amount of the underwriting and placement fee 
accrued for each of them, after they have in turn paid the face amount of the Bonds placed by each of them 
and, as the case may be, subscribed for on their own account up to their respective underwriting 
commitments. 
 
BANCAJA, CALYON, DEUTSCHE BANK and JPMORGAN shall be involved as Lead Managers in the Bond 
Issue. They shall not be remunerated for managing the Bond Issue.

of the Subscription Period. 
 
 
II.20 
Entry and registration of the subscription for the Bonds. 
The Bonds, represented by means of book entries, shall become such bonds upon being entered in the

II.21 
National laws governing the Bonds and jurisdiction in the event of litigation. 
The constitution of the Fund and Bond issue are subject to Spanish Law, and specifically to the provisions of 
(i) the Deed of Constitution; (ii) Royal Decree 926/1998 and implementing regulations; (iii) Act 19/1992, failing 
a provision in Royal Decree 926/1998, and to the extent applicable; (iv) Act 3/1994; (v) Act 44/2002 (in 
particular article 18 thereof); (vi) the Securities Market Act, and (vii) all other legal and statutory provisions in 
force and applicable from time to time. 
 
The constitution of the Fund, the issue of the Bonds and the agreements for transactions covering financial 
risks and the rendering of services to be entered into by the Management Company on behalf of the Fund 
shall be subject to Spanish Law. The Deed of Constitution and the transaction agreements  to be entered into 
by the Management Company on behalf of the Fund shall at all events be subject to Spanish Laws. 
 
All matters, disagreements, actions and claims deriving from the Management Company’s constitution, 
administration and legal representation of BANCAJA 8 FONDO DE TITULIZACIÓN DE ACTIVOS and the 
Bond Issue by the same, shall be submitted to the competent Spanish Courts and Tribunals. 
 
The Bondholders and the remaining creditors of the Fund shall have no recourse whatsoever against 
Mortgage Loan Obligors who may have defaulted on their payment obligations. Any such rights shall lie with 
the Management Company, representing the Fund. 
 
The Bondholders and the remaining creditors of the Fund shall have no recourse whatsoever against the Fund 
or against the Management Company in the event of non-payment of amounts due by the Fund resulting from 
the existence of default or early amortisation or prepayment of the Pass-Through Certificates, a breach by the 
counterparties to the transactions entered into for and on behalf of the Fund, or shortfall of the financial 
hedging transactions for servicing the Bonds in each Series.  
 
The Bondholders and the remaining creditors of the Fund shall have no recourse against the Management 
Company other than as derived from a breach of its duties. Those actions shall be resolved in the relevant 
ordinary declaratory proceedings depending on the amount claimed. 
 
 
II.22 
Tax system derived from the securities offered. 
A brief account is given hereinafter of the tax system applicable to the investments derived from this offering, 
in which connection only State laws in force for the time being and general aspects that might affect investors 
are taken into account; investors must bear in mind both their possible special tax circumstances and the rules 
applied territorially and contained in the laws in force at the time when the relevant income is obtained and 
returned. 
 
Because the Bonds will be represented by book entries and an application will be made for the securities to be 
listed and traded on an official Spanish secondary securities market, which circumstances are relevant to 
determining their taxation, the assumption made is that these requirements shall be met. It has moreover been 
considered that, upon being issued, the Bonds will be considered financial assets with an explicit yield, when 
this qualification is relevant for tax purposes. 
  
The withholdings, contributions and taxes established now or in the future on the Bond principal, interest or 
income shall be payable by the Bondholders, and their amount shall be deducted, as the case may be, in the 
manner statutorily prescribed. 
 
During the life of the Bonds, their tax system shall be as derived from the laws in force from time to time. 
 
It should finally be noted that the tax treatment described herein is general and has not therefore included the 
taxation applicable to income obtained through entities under an imputed income system, or the system 
applicable to all categories of investors, some of which (such as, for instance, financial institutions, 
Undertakings for Collective Investment, Co-operatives, etc.) may be subject to special rules.

II.22.1 
Natural or legal persons resident in Spain. 
Personal Income Tax. 
Income obtained by Bondholders who are Personal Income Tax (IRPF) payers, both as interest and in 
connection with the transfer, repayment or amortisation of the Bonds, shall be considered income on 
investments obtained from the assignment of own capital to third parties, as defined in article 23.2 of 
Legislative Royal Decree 3/2004, March 5, approving the Consolidation of the Personal Income Tax Act (the 
“IRPF Act”). 
 
In this sense, in the event of revenues derived from receipt of Bond coupons (interest), the aggregate income 
shall be determined by the amount of interest received, including the IRPF withholding made, as the case may 
be. 
 
Furthermore, in the event of transfer, redemption or amortisation of the Bonds, the income on investments 
shall be deemed to be the difference between the transfer, redemption or amortisation value (less properly 
supported ancillary disposal expenses) and the acquisition or subscription value (plus properly supported 
ancillary acquisition expenses). When the taxpayer has acquired other homogeneous financial assets within 
two months before or after transfer, redemption or amortisation, negative income from the Bonds shall 
nevertheless be integrated in the taxable income as the Bonds remaining on the taxpayer’s assets are 
transferred. 
 
The net income on investments shall be found deducting the Bond servicing and custody expenses from the 
aggregate income, provided that those expenses are not the consideration for a discretionary and 
individualised management of the portfolio of investments. The net income from the transfer, redemption or 
amortisation of Bonds generated over a time-period in excess of two years shall be reduced by 40%.  
 
Interest income received shall be subject to a 15% withholding tax on account of the beneficiary’s IRPF. 
 
However, there is no withholding tax obligation on income derived from the transfer or repayment of the 
Bonds, because these are represented by means of book entries and are traded on an official Spanish 
securities market, other than for the part of the price equivalent to the matured coupon in transfers made 
within thirty days immediately preceding coupon maturity where (i) the transferee is a person or undertaking 
not resident in Spanish territory or a Corporation Tax obligor, and (ii) this explicit income is exempt from the 
obligation to withhold in relation to the transferee.  
 
Corporation Tax. 
Both interest income and income derived from the transfer, repayment or amortisation of the Bonds obtained 
by undertakings considered to be Corporation Tax payers, shall be added to the tax base as prescribed under 
Title IV of Legislative Royal Decree 4/2004, March 5, approving the Consolidation of the Corporation Tax Act.  
 
The aforesaid income shall not be subject to a Corporation Tax withholding as provided by article 59.q) of 
Royal Decree 1777/2004, July 30, approving the Corporation Tax Regulations (“Royal Decree 1777/2004”), 
considering that the Bonds satisfy the following requirements -as this Bond Issue is expected to do: 
 
1.  That they are represented by means of book entries. 
2.  That they are traded on a Spanish official secondary securities market.   
 
The procedure for the exclusion of withholding tax or prepayment on the Bond interest to be effective, in 
accordance with the Ministerial Order of 22nd December 1999, shall be subject to the following requirements: 
 
1. 
The Management Company, for and on behalf of the Fund as the issuer, shall pay the custodians, 
through the Paying Agent, the liquid amount resulting from applying the general withholding rate in force 
on that date (currently 15%) to all the interest. 
 
2. 
By the 10th of the month after the month of maturity of each coupon, the custodians shall provide the 
Management Company or the Paying Agent with an itemised list of the holders who must pay Corporation 
Tax, along with their identification particulars, ISIN code for the securities, the number of securities they 
held at the date of maturity of each coupon, the respective gross income and the amount withheld.

Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores may have any legal effect whatsoever or be taken into account with respect to the Bond Issue. 
 
 
 
 
50
3. 
Bondholders who are Corporation Tax obligors shall certify that circumstance with the custodians of the 
securities by the 10th of the month after coupon maturity in order that the custodians may draw up the list 
specified in the preceding paragraph. 
 
4. 
Forthwith upon receiving that list, the Management Company shall promptly pay the custodians through 
the Paying Agent the excess amount withheld from those obligors. 
 
5. 
The custodians shall forthwith pay the amount withheld to the obligor holders. 
 
For the purpose of establishing that they are Corporation Tax obligors, Bondholders may use any means of 
proof admissible at Law and must produce appropriate supporting documents which shall remain with the 
Bond custodian, at the disposal of the issuer (the Management Company on the Fund’s behalf) to be checked 
and of the State Agency for Taxation Administration. In this connection, supporting documents shall be taken 
to mean a photocopy of the card establishing the Tax Identification Number. 
 
II.22.2 
Natural or legal persons not resident in Spain. 
Income obtained by Bondholders who are Non-Resident Income Tax payers, both on interest and in 
connection with the transfer, repayment or amortisation of the Bonds, shall be considered to be income 
obtained in Spain, with or without a permanent establishment, on the terms of articles 12 and 13 of Legislative 
Royal Decree 5/2004, March 5, approving the Consolidation of the Non-Resident Income Tax Act (the “IRNR 
Act”). 
 
Income obtained through a permanent establishment. 
Bond income obtained by a permanent establishment in Spain shall pay tax in accordance with the rules of 
Chapter III of the above-mentioned IRNR Act, notwithstanding the provisions of double-taxation Agreements 
of which Spain is a signatory, which might determine that the relevant income pays no tax or that reduced tax 
rates apply. The aforesaid income shall be excluded from Non-Resident Income Tax withholding on the terms 
set out above for Spanish Corporation Tax obligors. 
 
Income obtained other than through a permanent establishment. 
Bond income obtained by persons or undertakings not resident in Spain acting for these purposes without a 
permanent establishment within Spanish territory shall pay tax in accordance with the rules of Chapter IV of 
the aforesaid IRNR Act, the following elements of the system of that Act being noteworthy, without prejudice to 
the provisions of double-taxation Agreements signed by Spain determining that the relevant income need pay 
no tax or, as the case may be, that reduced rates apply: 
 
• 
The tax base shall be quantified as the full amount of the income obtained, calculated with reference to the 
rules of the IRPF Act, whereas the reductions of that Act will not apply. 
 
• 
In the event of transfer, repayment or amortisation, expenses attaching to acquisition and disposition shall 
be taken into account for calculating the income, provided that they are properly supported. Taxation shall 
be separately effected for each total or partial taxable accrual of income, which may under no 
circumstances be set off against one another.  
 
• 
Bond income obtained both as interest and in connection with transfer, repayment or amortisation of the 
Bonds shall be exempt when obtained without a permanent establishment by residents of another 
European Union Member State or by permanent establishments of those residents located in another 
European Union Member State (article 14.1.c) of the IRNR Act). 
 
• 
Income derived from the transfer of such securities made on any of the official Spanish secondary 
securities markets obtained by non-resident natural persons or undertakings other than through a 
permanent establishment in Spanish territory, resident in a State having signed a double-taxation 
Agreement with Spain with an information-exchange clause, will also be exempt. 
 
• 
The two exemptions referred to shall by no means apply where the income is obtained through countries 
or territories statutorily qualified as tax havens.   
 


 This is a Certified Translation into English of the Spanish Offering Circular. No document other than the Spanish Offering Circular approved by the 
Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores may have any legal effect whatsoever or be taken into account with respect to the Bond Issue. 
 
 
 
 
51
• 
The Tax will be calculated applying a 15 percent rate to the tax base comprising Bond interest and other 
income unless an exemption or a lower rate applies in pursuance of the provisions of the internal law or in 
an Agreement signed by Spain. Where on account of the investor’s residence a Double Taxation 
Agreement signed by Spain is applicable, the reduced tax rate provided for in said Agreement for income 
of this kind shall be applied, as the case may be. 
 
• 
The application of any exemption or reduced rate for which provision is made in the internal laws or in an 
Agreement signed by Spain shall require satisfactory proof of the investor’s tax residence by producing a 
tax residence certificate issued by the tax authorities of the country in which that investor is resident in the 
manners for which provision is made in Spanish laws. 
 
• 
On the other hand, Bond coupons are in principle liable to a withholding, unless evidence is produced of 
Tax exemption or payment. The amount withheld is equivalent to the final Tax. 
 
• 
In accordance with the Ministerial Order of April 13, 2000, where financial institutions domiciled, resident or 
represented in Spain that are custodians or manage collection of the income on those securities are 
involved in the Bond interest payment procedure, the exclusion from withholding tax or withholding at a 
reduced rate by applying the taxation limits established in double-taxation Agreements shall be put in 
place as described hereinafter: 
  
1. The Management Company shall, for and on behalf of the Fund as the issuer, through the Paying 
Agent, pay to the custodians the net amount resulting from applying the general withholding rate in 
force on that date to all the interest. 
 
2. By the 10th of the month after the month of maturity of each coupon, the custodians shall provide the 
Management Company or the Paying Agent by value/issue code and maturity/distribution date with an 
itemised list of the holders who are Non-Resident Income Tax obligors for obtaining income in Spanish 
territory without a permanent establishment with the ISIN code for the securities, type of income, type 
of person, tax residence country code, along with their identification particulars, the number of 
securities they held at the date of maturity of each coupon, the respective gross income and the excess 
percentage withheld from each holder. 
 
3. Bondholders who are Non-Resident Income Tax payers without a permanent establishment in Spain 
shall have established to the custodians that they are entitled to have the taxation limits of an 
Agreement applied or to be excused from withholding. The custodians shall draw up the list referred to 
in the preceding paragraph including the holders of the securities who have established that right upon 
the list being issued to the Management Company. 
 
4. Forthwith upon receiving the list referred to in paragraph 2 above, the Management Company shall 
promptly pay all the custodians through the Paying Agent the amount withheld from those taxpayers. 
 
5. The custodians shall forthwith pay the excess amount withheld from holders who are Non-Resident 
Income Tax payers. 
 
6. For the purpose of establishing the right to have the withholding made applying the taxation limits of an 
Agreement or to be excused therefrom, taxpayers shall prove their tax residence by means of the 
following documents: 
 
• 
When the withholding exclusion results from the application of internal Spanish regulations, by 
means of a residence certificate issued by the tax authorities of the country of residence.  
 
• 
When the withholding exclusion or the withholding is made at a reduced rate, under an Agreement 
with a certificate issued by the respective tax authority, expressly recording that the taxpayer is a 
resident within the meaning of the Agreement. Nevertheless, when a withholding is made applying 
a taxation limit laid down in an Agreement implemented by means of an Order establishing the use 
of a specific form, this shall be established therewith in lieu of the certificate. 
 
The residence certificates referred to in the preceding paragraphs shall in principle be valid for one 
year after the date of issue.

Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores may have any legal effect whatsoever or be taken into account with respect to the Bond Issue. 
 
 
 
 
52
7. In the event that tax residence may not be established for these purposes, Bond income obtained both 
as interest and in connection with the transfer, repayment or amortisation of the Bonds, by non-resident 
holders shall be subject to taxation under the general system aforesaid, although a refund of the 
excess withholding or taxation may be applied for by means of the procedure for which provision is 
made in the laws in force for the time being. 
 
• 
Furthermore, and whether or not they pay the Tax, Bond transfer or repayment income shall not be liable 
to withholding because the financial assets have an explicit yield, are represented by book entries and are 
traded on an official Spanish secondary securities market, on the terms and conditions for which provision 
is made in article 73.3.f) of Royal Decree 1775/2004, July 30, approving the Personal Income Tax 
Regulations, under an express renvoi made in article 10.3.b) of Royal Decree 1776/2004, July 30, 
approving the Non-Resident Personal Income Tax Regulations. The reference in the aforesaid article to 
the rule of the Personal Income Tax Regulations shall not expressly excuse the application of the so-called 
anti-coupon laundering rule where the investor is a non-resident without a permanent establishment in 
Spain1. The foregoing shall be without prejudice to the joint and several liability of the Bond custodian or 
manager, and the actual non-resident holder’s duties to return and pay the Tax in due course. 
 
 
II.22.3 
Indirect taxation on the transfer of the Bonds. 
The subscription for and acquisition and conveyance of Bonds is exempt from paying Capital Transfer and 
Documents Under Seal Tax and Value Added Tax. 
  
II.22.4 
Wealth Tax. 
Natural persons whose personal obligation it is to pay this Tax and have to submit a return on this Tax and 
who are Bondholders at December 31 of each year, shall include the Bonds in that Tax base at their average 
trading value in the fourth quarter of each year. 
 
Non-resident natural persons who are Bondholders at December 31 of each year shall be payers of the Tax 
by real obligation and will also have to pay Wealth Tax, other than as provided in the double-taxation 
Agreements. Nevertheless, residents in other European Union countries (other than those holding their 
financial assets through a tax haven) in regard to Bonds whose income is exempt in regard to Non-Resident 
Income Tax, on the terms set forth above, shall be exempt.  
 
II.22.5 
Inheritance and Gift Tax. 
The transfer of the Bonds to natural persons by inheritance or donation shall be subject to the general rules of 
Inheritance and Gift Tax without prejudice to the provisions of double-taxation Agreements signed by Spain. In 
the event that the beneficiary should be a Company, the income obtained would be taxed in accordance with 
the Corporation Tax or Non-Resident Personal Income Tax rules, in the event that the beneficiary is a non-
resident entity for tax purposes in Spain.   
 
 
II.23 
Purpose of the transaction. 
The net amount of the payment for subscribing for the Series A, B, C and D Bonds will be fully allocated to 
paying the price for the subscription for the Pass-Through Certificates issued by BANCAJA pooled in the Fund 
assets.  
 
The amount of the payment for subscribing for the Series E Bonds will be fully allocated to setting up the Initial 
Cash Reserve on the terms provided for in section III.2.3 of this Offering Circular.  
 
 
 
                                                           
1 The application of this rule would result in a withholding being made on the part of the price equivalent to the coupon 
accrued on transfers made within thirty days immediately preceding coupon maturity where (i) the purchaser is a person or 
an entity not resident in Spanish territory, or a Corporation Tax payer, and (ii) this return is excused from the obligation to 
withhold for the purchaser.

Royal Decree 926/1998 and shall be subject to (i) the Deed of Constitution; (ii) Royal Decree 926/1998 and 
implementing regulations; (iii) Act 19/1992, failing a provision in Royal Decree 926/1998 and to the extent

The name of the Fund is “BANCAJA 8 FONDO DE TITULIZACIÓN DE ACTIVOS” and the following short 
names may also be used without distinction to identify the Fund:  
• 
BANCAJA 8 FTA 
• 
BANCAJA 8 F.T.A. 
 
The Fund is set up to serve as a vehicle for pooling the Pass-Through Certificates on the Mortgage Loans, to 
be issued by BANCAJA and subscribed for by the Management Company for and on behalf of the Fund upon 
being constituted, and to make the Bond Issue, by means of a financial transformation and credit 
enhancement process derived from the various lending and borrowing and hedging transactions arranged for 
on the Fund’s behalf. 
 
Companies Register. 
For the record, neither the constitution of the Fund nor the Bonds issued backed by its assets shall be entered 
in the Companies Register, in pursuance of the facultative authority for which provision is made in article 5.4 
of Royal Decree 926/1998. 
 
 
III.2 
Legal nature of the Fund. 
The Fund shall be a separate closed-end fund, devoid of legal personality. Its assets shall comprise the Pass-
Through Certificates to be pooled therein upon being constituted, the Cash Reserve and the start-up 
(constitution and issue) expenses, and its liabilities shall comprise the Bonds issued and the Start-Up Loan. 
Additionally, the Fund arranges Interest Swaps to be reported in memorandum accounts. 
 
The Management Company, for and on behalf of the Fund, and BANCAJA as Originator, shall in the Deed of 
Constitution perfect the agreement assigning the Mortgage Loans to the Fund, effective from that assignment 
date, which is the Fund constitution date, which shall be perfected by means of the issue by BANCAJA of and 
the subscription by the Fund for Pass-Through Certificates as established by Act 2/1981 and by additional 
provision five of Act 3/1994, as worded by article 18 of Act 44/2002. 
 
The issue of the Pass-Through Certificates shall be made for all the outstanding principal pending repayment 
on the issue date and for all the ordinary and late-payment interest on each Mortgage Loan assigned. 
Moreover, the assignment of each Mortgage Loan shall confer on the Fund the right to receive all possible 
rights or compensations on the Mortgage Loans accruing for the Originator and derived therefrom, including 
those derived from any right attached to the Mortgage Loans, excluding the fees if any established for each of 
the Mortgage Loans, which shall remain to the benefit of the Originator. 
 
The above-mentioned rights will all accrue for the Fund from the date of issue of the Pass-Through 
Certificates (Fund constitution date). Interest will also include interest accrued and not due from the last 
interest settlement date of each of the Mortgage Loans, before or on the date of assignment, and interest due 
and not paid on that same date.

III.7.1 
Early Liquidation of the Fund. 
III.7.1.1 
Following notice served on the CNMV, the Management Company shall be entitled to proceed to an early 
liquidation (“Early Liquidation”) of the Fund and thereby an early amortisation (“Early Amortisation”), on a 
Payment Date, of the entire Bond Issue, in the following early liquidation events (“Early Liquidation Events”): 
 
(i) 
When the amount of the Outstanding Balance of the Mortgage Loans yet to be amortised is less than 10 
percent of the initial Outstanding Balance upon the constitution of the Fund, in accordance with the 
authorisation established in article 5.3 of Act 19/1992 and provided that the payment obligations derived 
from the Series A, B, C and D Bonds may be honoured and settled in full in the Liquidation Priority of 
Payments. 
 
Payment obligations derived from the Series A, B, C and D Bonds on the date of Early Liquidation of the 
Fund shall at all events be deemed to be the Outstanding Principal Balance of these Series on that date 
plus interest accrued and not paid until that date, which amounts shall be deemed to be due and payable 
on that date to all statutory intents and purposes. 
 
(ii) 
Where any event or circumstance whatsoever unrelated to the actual operation of the Fund occurs which 
results in the financial balance of the Fund required by article 11.b) of Royal Decree 926/1998 being 
substantially changed or permanently invalidated. This event includes such circumstances as the 
occurrence of a change in or supplementary enactments of laws, or the establishment of withholding 
obligations or other events that might permanently affect the financial balance of the Fund. 
 
(iii) Mandatorily, in the event that the Management Company should be adjudged insolvent, or the statutory 
term to do so, or failing that term four months, should elapse without a new management company being 
designated in accordance with the provisions of section III.8.2 of this Offering Circular. 
 
(iv) Where a default on payment occurs or is expected to occur indicating a serious, permanent imbalance in 
relation to any of the Bonds issued or any unsubordinated credit. 
 
(v) 
Upon the lapse of thirty (30) months from the date of the last maturity of the Mortgage Loans, even if 
amounts are still due and payable thereon. 
 
III.7.1.2 
The following requirements shall be necessary to proceed to that Early Liquidation of the Fund: 
 
(i) 
That Bondholders be given at least fifteen (15) Business Days’ notice, as prescribed in section III.4.2 of 
this Offering Circular, of the Management Company’s resolution to proceed to an Early Liquidation of the 
Fund. 
 
(ii) 
That the Management Company shall have previously advised the CNMV and the Rating Agencies of 
that notice. 
 
(iii) That notice of the Management Company’s resolution to proceed to the Early Liquidation of the Fund 
shall contain a description (i) of the event or events for which an Early Liquidation of the Fund is effected, 
(ii) of the liquidation procedure, and (iii) of the manner in which the payment obligations derived from the 
Bonds are to be met and settled in the Liquidation Priority of Payments. 
 
III.7.1.3 
In order for the Fund, through its Management Company, to proceed to an Early Liquidation of the Fund and 
an Early Amortisation of the Bond Issue in the events and subject to the requirements defined in this section, 
the Management Company, for and on behalf of the Fund: 
 
(i) 
Shall, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (iv) below, proceed to sell the Pass-Through 
Certificates remaining in the Fund for a price which shall not be less than the sum of the value of the 
principal yet to be repaid plus interest accrued and not paid on the relevant Mortgage Loans plus. 
 
(ii) 
Shall proceed to terminate such agreements as are not necessary for the Fund liquidation procedure. 
 
(iii) Shall be entitled to arrange for a credit facility which shall be fully and forthwith allocated to the Early 
Amortisation of the Bond Issue. Repayment of that credit facility shall be guaranteed solely with the

Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores may have any legal effect whatsoever or be taken into account with respect to the Bond Issue. 
 
 
 
 
65
interest and principal flows derived from the Mortgage Loans pending amortisation and the proceeds 
from the sale of the other properties remaining on the assets of the Fund. 
 
(iv) Finally, both due to an insufficiency of the preceding actions and the existence of Pass-Through 
Certificates or other remaining assets of the Fund, the Management Company shall proceed to sell them 
and shall therefore invite a bid from at least five (5) entities from among the most active in the purchase 
and sale of those assets who may, in its view, give a market value. The Management Company shall be 
bound to accept the best bid received for the assets on offer which, in its view, covers the market value 
of the asset at issue. In order for the market value to be fixed, the Management Company may 
commission such valuation reports as it shall see fit. 
 
In events (i), (iii) and (iv) above, BANCAJA shall have a pre-emptive right on the terms established by the 
Management Company and will therefore have priority over third parties to acquire the Pass-Through 
Certificates or other properties derived therefrom remaining on the assets of the Fund, or to grant to the Fund, 
as the case may be, the credit facility designed for the Early Amortisation of the Bond Issue. The Management 
Company shall therefore send BANCAJA a list of the assets and of third-party bids received, and the latter 
may use that right for all the assets offered by the Management Company or the credit facility within ten (10) 
Business Days of receiving said notice, and provided that its bid is at least equal to the best of the third-party 
bids. 
 
III.7.1.4 
Upon provisioning the reserve referred to in section III.7.2 below, the Management Company shall 
immediately apply all the proceeds from the sale of the Fund’s assets to paying the various items, in such 
manner, amount and order as shall be requisite in the Liquidation Priority of Payments, other than the 
amounts, if any, drawn under the credit facility arranged, which shall be fully allocated to the Early 
Amortisation of the Bond Issue. 
 
III.7.2 
Termination of the Fund. 
The Fund shall terminate in the following events: 
(i) 
Upon the Pass-Through Certificates pooled therein being fully amortised. 
(ii) 
Upon the Bonds issued being fully amortised. 
(iii) Upon the conclusion of the Early Liquidation procedure established in section III.7.1 above. 
(iv) At all events, upon the final liquidation of the Fund on the Final Maturity Date (October 25, 2037, or the 
following Business Day if that is not a Business Day). 
(v) 
Upon the Fund constitution terminating in the event that Moody’s and Fitch should not confirm any of the 
assigned provisional ratings as final ratings by the start of the Subscription Period. In this event, the 
Management Company shall terminate the constitution of the Fund, the issue of and subscription for the 
Pass-Through Certificates and the Bond Issue.  
Termination of the constitution of the Fund shall be notified to the CNMV as soon as such termination is 
confirmed, and shall be publicised by means of the procedure specified in section III.4.2.b) and c) of this 
Offering Circular. Within not more than one month after the occurrence of the event of termination, the 
Management Company shall execute a statutory declaration before a Notary Public declaring that the 
Fund’s obligations have been settled and terminated and that the Fund has terminated. Notwithstanding 
the above, the Fund Management Company shall defray the Fund constitution expenses payable and 
specified in section II.14 with the Start-Up Loan, the agreement for which shall not be terminated but 
shall rather be cancelled after those amounts are settled, the repayment of principal being subordinated 
to fulfilment of all other obligations undertaken by the Management Company, acting for and on the 
Fund’s behalf. 
 
In the event that there should be any remainder upon the Fund being liquidated and after making all payments 
to the various creditors of the Fund by distributing the Available Funds in the set Liquidation Priority of 
Payments, that remainder shall be for BANCAJA on the terms established by the Management Company for 
liquidation. 
 
In any event, the Management Company, acting for and on behalf of the Fund, shall not proceed to terminate 
the Fund and strike it off the relevant administrative registers until the Fund’s remaining assets have all been

liquidated and the Liquidation Available Funds have all been distributed, in the Fund Liquidation Priority of 
Payments. 
 
Upon a period of six (6) months elapsing from the liquidation of the Fund’s remaining assets and the 
distribution of the Available Funds, the Management Company shall execute a Statutory Declaration before a 
Notary Public declaring (i) that the Fund has terminated, and the events prompting its termination, (ii) how the 
Bondholders and the CNMV were given notice, and (iii) how the Fund’s available funds were distributed, in the 
Fund Liquidation Priority of Payments; notice of this shall be given in a nation-wide newspaper and all other 
appropriate administrative procedures will be observed. The Management Company will submit that statutory 
declaration to the CNMV.

the Fund shall have no recourse against the Fund Management Company, other than for a breach of its duties 
or failure to observe the provisions of the Deed of Constitution and the Offering Circular.   
 
The Management Company shall notify Bondholders and all other ordinary creditors of the Fund of all and any

CHAPTER IV 
 
 
INFORMATION ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ASSETS SECURITISED THROUGH THE FUND 
 
 
IV.1 
Assets pooled in the Fund. 
The credit rights making up the Fund assets shall only be credit rights owned by BANCAJA derived from loans 
granted by BANCAJA to individuals with real estate mortgage security on finished homes located within 
Spanish territory, both directly and through subrogations of financing granted to developers (the “Mortgage 
Loans”). The Mortgage Loans shall be transferred by BANCAJA to the Fund by means of the issue of pass-
through certificates (the “Pass-Through Certificates”) in accordance with the respective individual 
characteristics of each of the Mortgage Loans.  
 
The Deed of Constitution shall perfect the issue by BANCAJA of the Pass-Through Certificates and their 
subscription by the Fund, represented by the Management Company, the most significant terms of which are 
set forth hereinafter in this section.  
 
The issue by BANCAJA of the Pass-Through Certificates and their subscription by the Fund will make up an 
as yet indeterminate number whose total principal or capital shall be equal to or slightly in excess of EUR one 
billion six hundred and fifty million (1,650,000,000.00). 
 
The Pass-Through Certificates will be issued on the Mortgage Loans as established in Act 2/1981 and 
additional provision five of Act 3/1994, as worded by article 18 of Act 44/2002, because (i) the principal yet to 
be repaid on certain mortgage loans is in excess of 80 percent of the appraisal value of the mortgaged 
property, and because (ii) there is no satisfactory evidence that the selected mortgage loans have all been 
granted in order to finance the acquisition, building or renovation of homes, although the Mortgage Loans are 
listed for any of those purposes in the Originator’s databases, or (iii) where earlier mortgages exist, that the 
latter have not been struck off the relevant Land Registry, despite having been wholly repaid. (Section 
IV.2.1.10) describes the potential legal implications of that). 
 
In accordance with Additional Provision Two of Bankruptcy Act 22/2003, July 9, as worded by Economic 
Reform Measures Act 36/2003, November 11, (“Bankruptcy Act”), Additional Provision Five of Act 3/1994, 
April 14, adapting Spanish law in regard to credit institutions to the Second Banking Co-ordination Directive 
and introducing other changes relating to the financial system, amended by article 18 of Act 44/2002, 
(“Additional Provision Five”), shall be applied with the objective and subjective scope provided for therein, 
and therefore, in the event of insolvency of the Originator of the Mortgage Loans pooled in the Fund by means 
of the issue of the Pass-Through Certificates, the assignment and issue may only be contested in the event of 
fraud and moreover provided that the Originator’s insolvency occurs within two years after conclusion of the 
assignment transaction and where there is a detriment to the estate. Thus, the Fund shall have an absolute 
right of separation on the terms established in article 80 of the Bankruptcy Act (and the references to articles 
908 and 909 of the Commercial Code referred to in article 15 of Mortgage Market Regulation Act 2/1981, 
March 25, referred to in Additional Provision Five, shall be deemed to have been replaced with the provision 
referred to in article 80 of the Bankruptcy Act).  
 
The Mortgage Loans shall be taken from a selection comprised of 15,259 mortgage loans, the outstanding 
principal of which amounted as of March 31, 2005 to EUR 1,748,468,443.63, with an overdue principal of EUR 
262,677.07, representing 0.015% on the total principal yet to be repaid. The detailed most significant 
characteristics of the mortgage loans selected are described in section IV.4 of this Chapter. 
  
In this Chapter and elsewhere in the Offering Circular, the term “Mortgage Loans” shall be used in some 
definitions to generically refer both to the Mortgage Loans and to the Pass-Through Certificates together, 
other than where reference is specifically made to the Pass-Through Certificates as such. 
 
IV.1.1 
Representations by BANCAJA. 
BANCAJA, as holder of the Mortgage Loans until assigned to the Fund and issuer of the Pass-Through 
Certificates, shall represent and warrant as follows to the Fund, the Management Company and the 
Underwriters and Placement Agents in the Deed of Constitution:

Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores may have any legal effect whatsoever or be taken into account with respect to the Bond Issue.

1. In relation to itself. 
(1) 
That BANCAJA is a credit institution duly incorporated in accordance with the laws in force for the 
time being and entered in the Companies Register and in the Register of Credit Institutions of the 
Bank of Spain, and that it is authorised to operate in the mortgage market. 
 
(2) 
That neither at today’s date nor at any time since it was incorporated has it had a creditors’ meeting 
called or been insolvent, in receivership or bankrupt, nor in any circumstance generating a liability 
which might result in the credit institution authorisation being revoked. 
 
(3) 
That it has obtained all necessary authorisations both from the administration and from its corporate

1. 
The Mortgage Loans will be fully and unconditionally assigned, perfected by means of the issue of the 
Pass-Through Certificates,  for the entire term remaining until maturity. 
2. 
The issue of the Pass-Through Certificates shall be made in respect of 100 percent of the outstanding 
principal, interest not due and overdue interest and all and any other amounts, assets or rights attaching 
to each of the relevant Mortgage Loans, excluding the fees established in each of the Mortgage Loans, 
which shall remain for the benefit of BANCAJA, as detailed in section IV.1.3 below. 
3. 
The Pass-Through Certificates shall be issued for the same term remaining until maturity of each of the 
underlying Mortgage Loans. 
4. 
BANCAJA shall be liable to the Fund for the existence and lawfulness of the Mortgage Loans to the 
same extent laid down in articles 348 of the Commercial Code and 1529 of the Civil Code.

whatsoever for default by the mortgagors of principal, interest or any other amount owing to them by the

75
Obligors under the Mortgage Loans. It will moreover have no liability whatsoever to directly or indirectly 
guarantee that the transaction will be properly performed, nor give any guarantees or security, nor 
indeed agree to replace or repurchase the Pass-Through Certificates, other than as provided in section 
IV.1.6 below. 
6. 
The Pass-Through Certificates shall be represented by registered certificates as established in section 
IV.1.5 below. 
7. 
Until the execution of the Deed of Constitution, BANCAJA shall be the beneficiary of the damage 
insurance contracts taken out by the Obligors in relation to the mortgaged properties as security for the 
Mortgage Loans, up to the insured amount, and each of the Mortgage Loan documents shall, in the 
event of default on the relevant premium by the Obligor (holder) of the insurance, authorise BANCAJA, 
the mortgagee, to pay the premium amount for the Obligor in order that the premiums are always paid. 
8. 
BANCAJA shall thereupon perfect the assignment attached to the issue of the Pass-Through Certificates 
of the rights BANCAJA has as the beneficiary of those damage insurance contracts taken out by the 
Obligors or any other insurance policy providing equivalent cover. As the holder of the Pass-Through 
Certificates, the Fund shall be entitled to all the amounts BANCAJA would have received in this 
connection. 
9. 
The transfer and holding of the Pass-Through Certificates shall be limited to institutional investors, and 
they may not be acquired by the unspecialised public. 
10. Given the above and that the Fund is an institutional investor, the issue of the Pass-Through Certificates 
shall not be subject to a marginal note on each entry of the mortgages in the Land Registry. 
 
IV.1.3 
Description of rights conferred on the Fund upon subscribing for the Pass-Through Certificates on the 
Mortgage Loans. 
Specifically, the Pass-Through Certificates shall confer on the Fund as the holder thereof the following rights 
in relation to each of the Mortgage Loans: 
a) 
To receive all amounts accruing as repayment of Mortgage Loan capital or principal. 
b) 
To receive all amounts accruing as ordinary interest on the Mortgage Loans. 
c) 
To receive all amounts accruing as late-payment interest on the Mortgage Loans. 
d) 
To receive any other amounts, assets or rights received as payment of the Mortgage Loan principal, 
interest or expenses, either in the form of the knock-down price or amount determined by a court 
decision or notarial procedure in foreclosing the mortgage securities, on the sale or utilisation of 
properties awarded or, upon foreclosing, in the administration or interim possession of the properties in 
foreclosure proceedings. 
e) 
To receive all possible rights or compensations accruing for BANCAJA, including not only those derived 
from the insurance contracts attached to the Mortgage Loans which are also assigned to the Fund, but 
also those derived from any ancillary right attached to the Mortgage Loan, excluding the fees established 
for each of the Mortgage Loans, which shall remain to the benefit of BANCAJA. 
 
The above-mentioned rights will all accrue for the Fund from the date of issue of the Pass-Through 
Certificates. Interest shall moreover include interest accrued and not due since the last interest settlement 
date on each of the Mortgage Loans, on or before the date of issue of the Pass-Through Certificates, and 
interest due and not paid on that same date. 
 
The rights of the Fund resulting from the Pass-Through Certificates are linked to the payments made by the 
Mortgage Loan Obligors, and are hence directly affected by the evolution, delays, prepayments or any other 
incident relating thereto. 
 
Returns on the Pass-Through Certificates constituting Fund income shall not be subject to a Corporation Tax 
withholding as established in Royal Decree 177/2004, July 30, approving the Corporation Tax Regulations. 
 
 
The Fund shall bear all and any expenses or costs arising for BANCAJA derived from the recovery actions in 
the event of a breach of obligations by the Mortgage Loan Obligors, including foreclosing against the same.

76
IV.1.4 
Issue price of the Pass-Through Certificates. 
The issue price of the Pass-Through Certificates will be at par. The total amount payable by the Fund for 
subscribing for the Pass-Through Certificates shall be the amount equivalent to the sum of (i) the face value of 
the capital or principal pending repayment of each of the Mortgage Loans, and (ii) ordinary interest accrued 
and not due and interest not paid on each of the Mortgage Loans on the date of issue of the Pass-Through 
Certificates (the “accrued interest”).  
 
The Management Company shall pay the total amount for subscribing for the Pass-Through Certificates on 
behalf of the Fund as follows: 
 
(i) The part consisting of the face value of the capital of all the Mortgage Loans, subparagraph (i) of 
paragraph one of this section, shall be paid by the Fund on the Bond Closing Date, for same day value, 
upon the subscription for the Bond Issue being paid up. The Originator shall receive no interest on the 
deferment of payment until the Closing Date. 
 
(ii) The part of the price consisting of the interest accrued on each of the Mortgage Loans, subparagraph (ii) of 
paragraph one of this section, shall be paid by the Fund on the earlier of the collection date falling on the 
first interest settlement date of each of the Mortgage Loans or the date on which they are paid by the 
Obligor, after the issue date of the Pass-Through Certificates, and will not be subject to the Fund Priority of 
Payments. 
 
If the Fund constitution and hence the Pass-Through Certificate issue and subscription should terminate, (i) 
the Fund’s obligation to pay the Pass-Through Certificates shall terminate, and (ii) the Management Company 
shall be obliged to restore to BANCAJA any rights whatsoever accrued for the Fund upon subscribing for the 
Pass-Through Certificates. 
 
IV.1.5 
Pass-Through Certificate representation and custody. 
The Pass-Through Certificates shall be represented by multiple or individual registered certificates, which shall 
contain at least the particulars prescribed for mortgage certificates in article 64 of Royal Decree 685/1982, 
along with the registration particulars of the properties securing the Mortgage Loans. The Pass-Through 
Certificates which shall be issued to be pooled in the Fund upon being constituted shall be represented in a 
multiple registered certificate. 
 
Both in the event that the Management Company should, for and on behalf of the Fund, proceed to foreclose 
a Mortgage Loan, as provided for in section IV.2.11, and because of an Early Liquidation of the Fund, in the 
events and on the terms of section III.7.1, there is to be a sale of Pass-Through Certificates, and in any other 
event so requiring, BANCAJA agrees to split any multiple certificate issued representing Pass-Through 
Certificates into such unit or multiple certificates as may be necessary, replacing or exchanging the same for 
the attainment of the above purposes. 
 
The multiple document representing the Pass-Through Certificates and, as the case may be, the unit 
certificates into which the same is split, shall be deposited at BANCAJA, and the relations between the Fund 
and BANCAJA shall be governed by the Mortgage Loan Servicing and Pass-Through Certificate Custody 
Agreement to be entered into between BANCAJA and the Management Company for and on behalf of the 
Fund. That deposit shall be established for the benefit of the Fund and BANCAJA shall therefore safe-keep 
the documents representing the Pass-Through Certificates deposited following the Management Company’s 
instructions. 
 
IV.1.6 
Set rules for substituting the Pass-Through Certificates. 
1. In the event of early amortisation of Pass-Through Certificates due to a prepayment of the Mortgage Loan 
capital, there will be no substitution of the Pass-Through Certificates affected thereby. 
 
2. In the event that it should be observed throughout the life of the Pass-Through Certificates that any of 
them or of the underlying Mortgage Loans fails to meet the representations contained in section IV.1.1 of 
this Offering Circular upon the Fund being constituted, BANCAJA agrees, subject to the Management 
Company’s consent, to proceed forthwith to remedy and, if that is not possible, to a substitution or, as the 
case may be, early amortisation of the Pass-Through Certificate in that situation, subject to the following 
rules: 


 This is a Certified Translation into English of the Spanish Offering Circular. No document other than the Spanish Offering Circular approved by the 
Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores may have any legal effect whatsoever or be taken into account with respect to the Bond Issue. 
 
 
 
 
77
 
a) The party becoming aware of the existence of a non-conforming Pass-Through Certificate, whether 
BANCAJA or the Management Company, shall notify the other party of this circumstance. BANCAJA 
shall have five (5) Business Days from said notice to proceed to remedy that circumstance if it may be 
remedied. 
 
b) The substitution shall be made for the outstanding principal plus interest accrued and not paid and any 
amount owing to the Fund until that date on the relevant Mortgage Loan underlying the substituted 
Pass-Through Certificate. 
 
In order to proceed to the substitution, BANCAJA shall notify the Management Company of the 
characteristics of the mortgage loans proposed to be assigned under new pass-through certificates 
satisfying the representations made in section IV.1.1 and similarly characterised as to residual term, 
interest rate, outstanding principal value, and credit quality construed as the existing ratio of the 
outstanding loan principal to the appraisal value of the property mortgaged as security, in order for the 
financial balance of the Fund, and indeed the Bond rating in accordance with the provisions of section 
II.3 of this Offering Circular, to be unaffected by the substitution. Once the Management Company has 
checked that the substitute loan is appropriate, because it may be included in the Fund, and expressly 
agreed to it, BANCAJA shall proceed to issue the new replacement pass-through certificate(s). 
 
c) The substitution shall be recorded in a notarial certificate setting forth all the particulars both of the 
Pass-Through Certificate to be replaced and the Mortgage Loan attached thereto, and the new pass-
through certificate(s) issued, along with details of the Mortgage Loans, and the reason for substituting 
and characteristics determining their homogenous nature as described in the last paragraph of section 
b) above, a copy of which shall be filed by the Management Company with the CNMV, the organisation 
in charge of the accounting record for the Bonds and the AIAF Governing Body, notifying the Rating 
Agencies. 
 
d) In the event that any Pass-Through Certificate should not be substituted by issuing new ones on the 
terms set in rule b) of this section, BANCAJA shall proceed to an early amortisation of the affected 
Pass-Through Certificate. That early amortisation shall take place by a repayment in cash to the Fund 
of the outstanding principal, interest accrued and not settled, and any other amount owing to the Fund 
until that date on the Mortgage Loan underlying the relevant Pass-Through Certificate.  
 
e) In the event of early amortisation of Pass-Through Certificates by BANCAJA due to both substitution 
and repayment, BANCAJA shall be vested in all the rights attaching to those Mortgage Loans accruing 
from the amortisation date or accrued and not due, and overdue amounts on that same date. 
 
IV.1.7 
Other terms derived from the legal system of the Pass-Through Certificates. 
As prescribed by Royal Decree 685/1982, the Pass-Through Certificates may be transferred by a written 
statement on the very certificate and, in general, by any of the means admitted by Law, in accordance with the 
provisions of article 67.1 of Royal Decree 685/1982, their acquisition or holding being limited to institutional or 
professional investors for they may not be acquired by the unspecialised public, in accordance with the 
provisions of article 64.1 of Royal Decree 685/1982. Both the transfer and the new holder’s address shall be 
notified by the transferee to the issuer. 
 
The transferor shall not be liable for the solvency of the issuer or of the Obligor, nor indeed of the sufficiency 
of the mortgage securing it. 
 
BANCAJA, as the issuer, shall keep a special book in which it shall enter the Pass-Through Certificates issued 
and such transfers thereof as may be notified to it, the Pass-Through Certificates being applied the provisions 
of article 53 of Royal Decree 685/1982 for registered certificates. The same book shall include the changes of 
address notified to it by the holders of the Pass-Through Certificates. 
 
The book shall moreover include the following particulars: 
a) Mortgage Loan origination and maturity date, initial amount and settlement method. 
b) Mortgage registration particulars.

IV.2 
Servicing and custody of the Mortgage Loans and custody of the Pass-Through Certificates. 
BANCAJA, originator of the Mortgage Loans, in accordance with the provisions of article 2.2.b) of Royal 
Decree 658/1982, and as issuer of the Pass-Through Certificates to be subscribed for by the Fund, in 
accordance with the provisions of article 61.3 of Royal Decree 685/1982, agrees to be the custodian and 
servicer of the Mortgage Loans, and the Mortgage Loan Servicing and Pass-Through Certificate Custody 
Agreement (the “Servicing Agreement”) shall govern the relations between BANCAJA (hereinafter in regard 
to this Agreement the “Servicer”) and the Fund, represented by the Management Company, in regard to the 
custody and servicing of the Mortgage Loans and the custody of the documents representing the Pass-
Through Certificates. In consideration of the custody, servicing and management of the Mortgage Loans and 
custody of the documents representing the Pass-Through Certificates, the Servicer shall be entitled to receive 
in arrears on each of the Payment Dates and during the term of the Servicing Agreement, a subordinated 
servicing fee equal to 0.01% per annum, inclusive of VAT if there is no exemption, which shall accrue on the 
exact number of days elapsed and on the average daily Outstanding Balance of the Mortgage Loans serviced 
during each Interest Accrual Period. If the Servicer should be substituted in that servicing task, because that is 
legally possible and is appropriate in view of circumstances of the Servicer which might prevent or make it 
difficult for that servicing to be properly performed, the Management Company will be entitled to change the 
above percentage fee in favour of the substitute institution, which fee may be higher than that agreed with 
BANCAJA under the Servicing Agreement. 
 
If due to a shortage of liquidity in the Fund Priority of Payments, the Fund should, through its Management 
Company, fail on a Payment Date to pay the full fee due, the amounts overdue shall accumulate without any 
penalty whatsoever on the fee payable on the following Payment Dates, whereupon they shall be paid. 
 
Furthermore, on each Payment Date, the Servicer shall be entitled to a reimbursement of all expenses of an 
exceptional nature incurred in relation to the servicing of the Mortgage Loans, such as expenses or court costs 
arising in connection with foreclosure, or administering or managing the sale of properties and assets 
awarded, and after first justifying the same. Those expenses will be paid whenever the Fund has sufficient 
liquidity and in the Fund Priority of Payments.   
 
The Servicing Agreement shall be fully terminated in the event that the Rating Agencies should not confirm the 
provisional ratings assigned to each of the Series as final by the start of the Subscription Period. 
 
BANCAJA shall continue servicing the Mortgage Loans, devoting as Servicer the same time and effort to them 
and the same degree of skill, care and diligence in servicing the same as it would devote and use to service its 
own mortgage loans, and will in any event exercise a suitable degree of skill, care and diligence in providing 
the services for which provision is made in said Servicing Agreement. 
 
In any event, the Servicer waives the privileges and authorities conferred on it by law as the manager of 
collections for the Fund and as servicer of the Mortgage Loans, and in particular those for which provision is 
made in articles 1730 and 1780 of the Civil Code and 276 of the Commercial Code. 
 
The most outstanding terms of the Servicing Agreement are set out hereinafter in the following subparagraphs 
of this section. 
 
IV.2.1 
Ordinary system and procedures for servicing and managing the Mortgage Loans. 
The following is the succinct and short description of the ordinary system and procedures (hereinafter the 
“services”) for service and custody of the Mortgage Loans governed by said Servicing Agreement:   
 
1. Term. 
The services shall be provided by the Servicer until all the obligations undertaken by the Servicer as issuer 
of the Pass-Through Certificates terminate in relation to all the Mortgage Loans, once they have been 
repaid, or when the liquidation of the Fund concludes after it terminates, without prejudice to a potential 
early termination of the Servicing Agreement, if that is legally possible in accordance with its terms. 
 
2. Custody of deeds, documents and files.  
The Servicer shall keep all deeds, documents and data files relating to the Mortgage Loans and the 
damage insurance policies of the mortgage properties under safe custody and shall not give up their 
possession, custody or control other than with the Management Company’s prior written consent for it to

Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores may have any legal effect whatsoever or be taken into account with respect to the Bond Issue. 
 
 
 
 
79
do so, unless a document should be required to institute proceedings to foreclose a Mortgage Loan, or any 
competent authority should so require and after first informing the Management Company. 
 
The Servicer shall allow the Management Company or the auditors of the Fund duly authorised thereby 
reasonable access at all times to said deeds, documents and records. Furthermore, whenever it is 
required to do so by the Management Company, it shall provide within two (2) Business Days of that 
request and clear of expenses, a copy or photocopy of any of such deeds and documents. 
 
3. Collection management.   
The Servicer shall continue managing collection of all amounts payable by the Obligors under the 
Mortgage Loans, and any other item including under the insurance contracts of the mortgaged properties 
securing the Mortgage Loans. The Servicer shall act due diligently for payments to be made by the 
Obligors to be collected in accordance with the contractual terms and conditions of the Mortgage Loans.  
 
 
The amounts received by the Servicer derived from the Mortgage Loans shall be paid by the Servicer into 
the Fund’s Treasury Account on the seventh day after the date on which they were received by the 
Servicer, or the following business day, for same day value, if that is not a business day, in accordance 
with the set terms and conditions. In this connection, business days shall be taken to be all those that are 
business days in accordance with the Savings Bank sector in the city of Valencia.  
 
 
In the event of a fall in the Servicer’s debt rating or credit quality resulting in the ratings given by the Rating 
Agencies to each of the Bond Series falling, the Management Company may, in a written notice addressed 
to the Servicer, change the collection dates and payment method at any time during the term of the 
Servicing Agreement, thereby for the amounts received by the Servicer derived from the Mortgage Loans 
to be previously paid to the Fund, which may indeed occur on the same day of being received by the 
Servicer. 
 
The Servicer may in no event pay any amount whatsoever to the Fund not previously received from the 
Obligors as payment for the Mortgage Loans. 
 
4. Fixing the interest rate.   
Because the Mortgage Loans have a floating interest rate, the Servicer will continue fixing the interest 
rates applicable to each of the interest periods in accordance with the provisions of the relevant Mortgage 
Loan agreements, submitting such relevant communications and notices as may be established therein. 
 
5. Mortgaged property damage insurance.   
The Servicer shall not take or fail to take any action resulting in the cancellation of any property damage 
insurance policy covering the mortgaged properties or reducing the amount payable in any claim 
thereunder. The Servicer shall act due diligently and in any event use the rights conferred under the 
insurance policies or the Mortgage Loans in order to keep those policies (or any other policy granting 
equivalent cover) in full force and effect in relation to each Mortgage Loan and the respective property 
subject of the Mortgage Loan. 
 
The Servicer shall be bound to advance payment of policy premiums not paid by the Obligors whenever it 
is fully acquainted with this circumstance, without prejudice to its right to be reimbursed by the Fund for 
amounts so paid. 
 
In the event of a claim, each Servicer shall coordinate actions for collecting compensations derived from 
the property damage insurance policies on the terms and conditions of the Mortgage Loans and the actual 
policies, paying the amounts received to the Fund. 
 
6. Information.   
The Servicer shall regularly communicate to the Management Company the information concerning the 
individual characteristics of each of the Mortgage Loans, fulfilment by the Obligors of their obligations 
under the Mortgage Loans, delinquency status, changes in the characteristics of the Mortgage Loans, 
actions in the event of late payment, legal actions and auction of properties, the foregoing subject to the 
procedures and within the time-periods established in the Servicing Agreement.

Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores may have any legal effect whatsoever or be taken into account with respect to the Bond Issue. 
 
 
 
 
80
Furthermore, the Servicer shall prepare and hand to the Management Company such additional 
information concerning the Mortgage Loans or the rights attaching thereto as the Management Company 
may reasonably request, and in particular the documents required for the Management Company, as the 
case may be, to bring legal actions. 
 
7. Liability of the Servicer.   
The Servicer shall at no time have any liability whatsoever in relation to the obligations of the Management 
Company as manager of the Fund and manager of Bondholders’ interests, nor in relation to the obligations 
of the Obligors derived from the Mortgage Loans, without prejudice to the liabilities undertaken thereby in 
the Deed of Constitution as issuer of the Pass-Through Certificates subscribed for by the Fund. 
 
The Servicer shall be liable to indemnify the Fund or its Management Company against any damage, loss 
or expense incurred by the latter due to a breach by the Servicer of its duties to safe-keep, service and 
report on the Mortgage Loans and to custody the documents representing the Pass-Through Certificates. 
 
8. Mortgage Loan subrogation. 
The Servicer shall be authorised to permit substitutions in the position of the Obligor under the Mortgage 
Loan agreements, exclusively where the characteristics of the new mortgagor are similar to those of the 
former mortgagor and those characteristics observe the policies for granting mortgage loans described in 
the BANCAJA memorandum on policies for granting mortgage loans, which shall be attached to the Fund 
Deed of Constitution, and moreover provided that the expenses derived from that change are fully borne 
by the Obligors. The Management Company may fully or partially limit this authority of the Servicer or lay 
down conditions therefor, in the event that there might be consequences being howsoever detrimental to 
the rating accorded to the Bonds by the Rating Agencies. 
 
The Obligor may apply to the Servicer for subrogation in connection with the Mortgage Loans pursuant to 
Mortgage Loan Subrogation and Amendment Act 2/1994. Subrogation of a new creditor under the 
Mortgage Loan and the ensuing payment of the amount due shall result in a prepayment of a Mortgage 
Loan and of the relevant Pass-Through Certificate. 
 
9. Authorities and actions in relation to Mortgage Loan renegotiation procedures. 
The Servicer may not voluntarily cancel the mortgages securing the Mortgage Loans for any reason other 
than payment of the Mortgage Loan, relinquish or settle in regard thereto, forgive the Mortgage Loans in 
full or in part or extend the same, or in general do anything that may diminish the status, enforceability at 
law or economic value of the mortgage or of the Mortgage Loans, without prejudice to its proceeding to 
heed requests by the Obligors with the same diligence and procedure as if the loans should not have been 
assigned. 
 
Notwithstanding the above, the Management Company may, as manager of third-party funds and bearing 
in mind the Obligors’ requests to the Servicer directly or under Act 2/1994, previously issue instructions to 
or authorise the Servicer to agree with the Obligor, subject to the terms and conditions of this section, for a 
novation changing the relevant Mortgage Loans, either by renegotiation of the margin applicable for 
determining the interest rate or by an extension of the maturity period, provided that those novations are 
not detrimental to the ranking of the Mortgage Loans. 
 
a) Renegotiating the margin applicable for determining the floating interest rate. 
1. The Servicer may under no circumstance entertain on its own account and without being so 
requested by the Obligor, renegotiations of the margin applicable for determining the interest rate 
which may result in a decrease in the interest rate applicable to a Mortgage Loan. In any event, 
whether or not it was generically authorised, any renegotiation of the margin applicable for 
determining the Mortgage Loan interest rate shall be taken on and settled bearing in mind the 
interests of the Fund. 
 
Without prejudice to the provisions hereinafter, any renegotiation subscribed by the Servicer shall 
be made exclusively with the prior written consent of the Management Company, on behalf of the 
Fund, and the Servicer agrees to seek such consent from the Management Company as soon as it 
is aware that an Obligor has requested a renegotiation. The Management Company may 
nevertheless initially authorise the Servicer to entertain and accept renegotiations of the margin

Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores may have any legal effect whatsoever or be taken into account with respect to the Bond Issue. 
 
 
 
 
81
applicable for determining the interest rate applicable to the Mortgage Loans, requested by the 
Obligors, without requiring the prior consent of the Management Company, subject to a number of 
general requirements established hereinafter in section 2 below. 
 
The Management Company may at any time during the term of the Agreement, on behalf of the 
Fund, cancel, suspend or change the requirements for the Servicer’s authorisation to renegotiate 
the margin applicable for determining the interest rate which it may previously have determined for 
the Servicer.  
 
The Servicer shall in renegotiating the margin applicable for determining the Mortgage Loan 
interest rate clause observe that the new interest rate terms are at arm’s length and no different 
from those applied by the Servicer proper in renegotiating or granting its floating-rate mortgage 
loans. In this connection, arm’s length interest rate shall be deemed to be the interest rate offered 
by the Servicer on the Spanish market for loans granted to individuals with real estate mortgage 
security with amounts, class of mortgaged real property and terms substantially similar to the 
renegotiated Mortgage Loan.  
 
2. Renegotiating the margin applicable for determining the interest rate for a Mortgage Loan shall in 
no event result in (i) its being changed to a floating interest rate with a benchmark index for 
determination other than the Euribor or Mibor reference rates or indices or where there is a revision 
period different from the one the Mortgage Loan had upon the Fund being constituted, and (ii) that 
the average margin or spread weighted by the outstanding principal of the Mortgage Loans is below 
70 basic percentage points above the Euribor or Mibor benchmark rates or index.  
 
b) Extending the period of maturity. 
The final maturity or final amortisation date of the Mortgage Loans may be extended (hereinafter 
“extending the term”) subject to the following rules and limitations: 
 
(i)    
The Servicer may in no case entertain on its own account, i.e. without it being so requested by 
the Obligor, a change in the final maturity date of the Mortgage Loan which may result in an 
extension of that date. The Servicer, without encouraging an extension of the term, shall act in 
relation to such extension bearing in mind at all times the Fund’s interests.  
 
(ii) 
The aggregate of the initial capital or principal of the Mortgage Loans assigned to the Fund with 
respect to which the maturity date is extended may not exceed 10.00% of the initial Outstanding 
Balance of the Mortgage Loans upon the Fund being constituted. 
 
(iii) 
The term of a specific Mortgage Loan may be extended provided that the following 
requirements are met: 
 
a) That the periodicity of repayment instalments of the capital or principal of the Mortgage Loan 
is at all events maintained, and the same repayment system is in place. 
 
b) That the new final maturity or final amortisation date does not extend beyond October 31, 
2034. 
 
(iv) 
The Management Company may at any time during the term of the Servicing Agreement, on the 
Fund’s behalf, cancel or suspend the Servicer’s authorisation to extend the term. 
 
If there should be any renegotiation of the interest rate of a Mortgage Loan or its due dates, the Servicer 
shall forthwith notify the Management Company of the terms resulting from each renegotiation. Such 
notice shall be made through the software or data file provided for the terms of the Mortgage Loans to be 
updated. Both the public deeds and the private agreements pertaining to a novation of the terms of the 
Mortgage Loans will be kept by the Servicer, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2 of this 
section. 
 
In the event of a renegotiation of the interest rate of the Mortgage Loans, or their due dates, consented to 
by the Management Company, for and on behalf of the Fund, the change in the terms shall affect the 
Fund.

10. Action against the Obligors in the event of default on the Mortgage Loans and powers of the holder 
of the Pass-Through Certificates.  
Actions in the event of late payment.  
The Servicer shall apply an identical diligence and procedure for claiming overdue amounts not paid on 
the Mortgage Loans as with the rest of its portfolio mortgage loans.  
 
In the event of default by the Obligor of the payment obligations, the Servicer shall take the actions 
described in the Servicing Agreement, taking for that purpose the steps it would ordinarily take if they were 
its portfolio loans and in accordance with standard banking usage and practice for collecting overdue 
amounts, and shall be bound to advance such expenses as may be necessary for those actions to be 
taken, without prejudice to its right to be reimbursed by the Fund. Needless to say, these actions include 
all such legal actions as the Servicer may deem necessary to claim and collect the amounts due by the 
Obligors. 
 
Legal actions. 
The Servicer, using its fiduciary title to the Mortgage Loans or using the power referred to in the following 
paragraph, shall take all relevant actions against Obligors failing to meet their payment obligations derived 
from the Mortgage Loans. Such an action shall be brought using the appropriate court enforcement 
procedures prescribed in articles 517 et seq. of the Civil Procedure Act. 
 
For the above purposes, and for the purposes of the provisions of articles 581.2 and 686.2 of the Civil 
Procedure Act if this should be necessary, the Management Company grants in the Deed of Constitution 
as full and extensive a power of attorney as may be required at Law to BANCAJA in order that the latter 
may, acting through any of its attorneys properly empowered for those purposes, for and on behalf of the 
Management Company, as the authorised representative of the Fund, demand by any judicial or other 
means the obligor of any of the Mortgage Loans to pay his debt and take legal action against the same, in 
addition to other authorities required to discharge its duties as Servicer.  
 
The Servicer shall as a general rule apply for foreclosure, advancing all necessary expenses to do so, if, 
for a period of six (6) months, the Obligor under a Mortgage Loan in default of payment obligations should 
fail to resume payments or the Servicer, with the Management Company’s consent, should fail to obtain a 
payment undertaking satisfactory to the interests of the Fund, and shall in any event forthwith proceed to 
apply for such foreclosure if the Management Company, on behalf of the Fund, should deem this fit after 
analysing the specific circumstances of the case.  
 
Some of the Mortgage Loans backing the Pass-Through Certificates may have validly registered in respect 
of the mortgaged properties underlying the Mortgage Loans, mortgages predating the Mortgage Loan, 
even though, as BANCAJA has declared in section IV.1.1.(6), the loans referred to in those mortgages 
have been fully repaid. 
  
Therefore, for registration purposes, those Mortgage Loans do not have a mortgage ranking first. The 
mortgage will rank behind registered mortgages. Notwithstanding that, because the loans underlying the 
previous mortgages have been fully repaid, no creditor is preferred above the Originator. 
 
Those previous mortgages shall have their registration cancelled in accordance with the provisions of the 
Mortgage Act and the Mortgage Regulations, as currently worded. Under those laws, in the event of the 
Mortgage Loan being foreclosed without the previous mortgages having been cancelled, although the 
loans referred to therein have been fully repaid, a final judgment (i.e., a judgment that may not be 
howsoever appealed) shall be necessary in order for a cancellation entry to be made in respect of those 
mortgages establishing that much, specifying the entries to be cancelled, in accordance with articles 76 et 
seq of the Mortgage Act and articles 173 et seq of the Mortgage Regulations.  
  
In the event of the Mortgage Loan being foreclosed without the previous mortgages having been cancelled 
in the register, the successful bidder or beneficiary of the property shall also be subrogated to the previous 
loan obligor’s position, as provided for in article 231 of the Mortgage Regulations, and article 118 of the 
Act. 
 


 This is a Certified Translation into English of the Spanish Offering Circular. No document other than the Spanish Offering Circular approved by the 
Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores may have any legal effect whatsoever or be taken into account with respect to the Bond Issue. 
 
 
 
 
83
Subject to the above, the Obligor and the former creditor under the loans may at any time execute a deed 
consenting cancellation of those mortgages. Finally, under article 209 of the Mortgage Act, proceedings 
may be commenced for the lifting of liens and thereby have mortgages that have expired cancelled, in 
accordance with civil laws. 
 
In the event of default by any Obligor, the Management Company, acting for and on behalf of the Fund, 
shall have the following remedies provided for mortgage certificates in article 66 of Royal Decree 
685/1982, which also apply to pass-through certificates: 
 
(i) 
To demand the Servicer to apply for foreclosure. 
 
(ii) 
To take part on an equal standing with BANCAJA, as issuer of the Pass-Through Certificates, in the 
foreclosure the latter shall have instituted against the Obligor, intervening to that end in any 
foreclosure proceedings commenced by the former. 
 
(iii) If the Servicer should fail to take that action within sixty (60) calendar days of a notice served through 
a Notary demanding payment of the debt, the Management Company, for and on behalf of the Fund, 
shall be secondarily entitled to bring the foreclosure action on the Mortgage Loan for both principal 
and interest. 
 
(iv) In the event that the proceedings instituted by the Servicer should come to a standstill, the Fund, duly 
represented by the Management Company, may be subrogated in the position of the former and 
continue the foreclosure proceedings, without the above period having to elapse. 
 
In the cases provided in paragraphs (iii) and (iv), the Management Company, for and on behalf of the 
Fund, may apply to the Judge or Notary with jurisdiction to commence or continue with the respective 
foreclosure proceedings, attaching to the application the original Pass-Through Certificate, the notice 
served though a Notary Public provided in section (iii) above and an office certificate as to the registration 
and subsistence of the mortgage. The Servicer shall be bound to issue a certification of the balance 
outstanding on the Mortgage Loan. 
 
If this should be required by law, and for the purposes of the provisions of the Civil Procedure Act, 
BANCAJA shall confer in the Deed of Constitution an irrevocable and as extensive and sufficient a power 
of attorney as may be required by Law in order for the Management Company, acting for and on behalf of 
BANCAJA, to demand through a Notary Public payment of the debt by the Obligor under any of the 
Mortgage Loans. 
 
The Management Company, for and on behalf of the Fund as holder of the Pass-Through Certificates, 
may also take part with equal rights with BANCAJA in the foreclosure proceedings and may in this sense, 
on the terms for which provision is made in the Civil Procedure Act, request the award of the mortgaged 
property as payment of the Mortgage Loan. The Management Company shall proceed to sell the property 
awarded within the shortest possible space of time and at arm’s length. 
 
Additionally, the Servicer will provide the Management Company with all such documents as the latter may 
request in relation to the Mortgage Loans and in particular the documents required for the Management 
Company to take legal actions, as the case may be.      
 
11. Recovery action against the Servicer.  
The Management Company shall, for and on behalf of the Fund, be entitled to file a recovery action 
against the Servicer claiming the principal and interest falling due under the Pass-Through Certificates, 
where the breach of the obligation to pay those amounts does not result from a default by the Mortgage 
Loan Obligors. 
 
Upon the Mortgage Loans terminating, the Fund shall, through its Management Company, retain a right of 
action against the Servicer until fulfilment of its obligations.

Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores may have any legal effect whatsoever or be taken into account with respect to the Bond Issue. 
 
 
 
 
84
12. Set-off.  
In the event that any of the Obligors under the Mortgage Loans should have a liquid credit right, due and 
payable vis-à-vis the Servicer, and because the assignment is made without the Obligor’s knowledge, any 
of the Mortgage Loans should be fully or partially set-off against that credit right, the Servicer shall remedy 
such circumstance or, if it cannot be remedied, the Servicer shall proceed to pay to the Fund the amount 
set off plus the accrued interest which would have been payable to the Fund until the date on which the 
payment is made, calculated on the terms applicable to the relevant Mortgage Loan. 
 
13. Subcontracting.  
The Servicer may subcontract any of the services it may have agreed to provide under the Servicing 
Agreement other than those that may not be so delegated in accordance with the laws in force for the time 
being. That subcontracting may in no event result in an additional cost or expense for the Fund or the 
Management Company, and may not result in the rating assigned to each of the Bond Series being 
adversely revised. Notwithstanding any subcontracting or delegation, the Servicer shall not be exonerated 
or released under that subcontract or delegation from any of the liabilities undertaken in the Servicing 
Agreement which may legally be attributed or ascribed to it. 
 
14. Substitution.  
In the event of a breach by the Servicer of the obligations imposed in the Servicing Agreement on the 
Servicer or in the event that the Servicer’s credit rating should fall or there should be a change in its 
financial position which may be detrimental to or place the financial structure of the Fund or the rights and 
interests of the Bondholders at risk, the Management Company shall, in addition to demanding that the 
Servicer fulfil its obligations under the Servicing Agreement, proceed to put in place, inter alia and after 
notifying the Rating Agencies, any of the following actions: (i) to demand that the Servicer subcontract or 
delegate to another institution fulfilment of the obligations and commitments undertaken in the Servicing 
Agreement; (ii) to have a third-party institution whose credit rating and quality is not detrimental to the 
rating given to the Bonds by the Rating Agencies guarantee all or part of the Servicer’s obligations; (iii) to 
terminate the Servicing Agreement if that is possible by Law, in which case the Management Company 
shall previously designate a new Servicer, provided that it has an acceptable credit quality that is not 
detrimental to the rating given to the Bonds by the Rating Agencies and that the new Servicer accepts the 
obligations contained in the Servicing Agreement or, as the case may be, in a new servicing agreement. 
 
Furthermore, in the event of insolvency, or indications thereof, of administration by the Bank of Spain, of 
liquidation or of substitution of the Servicer, the Management Company may demand the Servicer to notify 
Obligors of the transfer to the Fund of the outstanding Mortgage Loans, and that the payments derived 
therefrom will only be effective as a discharge if made into the Treasury Account opened in the name of 
the Fund. However, both in the event of the Servicer failing to notify Obligors within five (5) Business Days 
of receiving the request and in the event of the Servicer becoming insolvent or going into liquidation, the 
Management Company itself shall directly or, as the case may be, through a new Servicer it shall have 
designated, notify Obligors. 
 
Upon the early termination of the Servicing Agreement, the Servicer shall provide the new Servicer, on 
demand by the Management Company and as determined thereby, with the necessary documents and 
data files for it to carry on the relevant activities.

pay monthly instalments comprising capital repayment and interest. 
 
At any time during the life of the loans, mortgagors may prepay all or part of the outstanding capital, in 
which case the accrual of interest on the part prepaid will cease as of the date on which the repayment 
occurs.

Circular. 
 
V.1.1 
Assumptions made in relation to the main or most likely rates of such factors as prepayment, late 
payments, delinquencies and defaults, with respect to the Mortgage Loans. 
The tables shown in section V.1.3 below relate to one of the hypothetical scenarios that could, in relation to 
the income and payments made and received by the Fund, arise during the term of the Fund and this Bond 
Issue. 
 
The following assumptions have been made in preparing these Bond servicing and Fund cash flow tables:  
 
a)  Mortgage Loans. 
• 
Outstanding principal of the portfolio as of March 31, 2005 from which the Mortgage Loans assigned 
to the Fund will be taken: EUR 1,748,468,443.63. 
• 
Interest Rate: 3.26% (% weighted average interest rate of the selected mortgage loan portfolio as of 
March 31, 2005). 
• 
CPR: 9%, 11% and 13% per annum. 
• 
Delinquency rate: 0.10% of the Outstanding Balance of the Pass-Through Certificates, with 100% 
recoveries within 15 months of becoming delinquent.

Total 
1,680,100,000.00 
 
(ii) 
Nominal Interest Rate: floating interest rate for the outstanding balances of each of the Series. 
 
• 
The following are the interest rates in each Series assumed for the Interest Accrual Periods, as 
specified in sections II.10.1.5.a) and II.12.a):

Exercise by the Management Company of the early amortisation option of the Bonds in each of the 
Series is assumed when the Outstanding Balance of the Mortgage Loans is less than 10% of their initial 
amount. 
 
d) Ancillary agreements. 
(i) 
Treasury Account. 
• 
It is assumed that the Treasury Account shall be maintained at BANCAJA. 
• 
Interest rate: it is assumed to remain constant at 2.144% for remunerating amounts credited to 
the Treasury Account. 
 
(ii) 
Start-Up Loan. 
• 
Amount: EUR 5,150,000.00 which shall be allocated to financing the expenses of setting up the 
Fund and issuing the Bonds (approximately EUR 2,908,485.28) and to partially financing the 
subscription for the Pass-Through Certificates (up to EUR 91,514.72) and the balance to covering 
the timing difference existing between Pass-Through Certificate interest collection and Bond 
interest payment (EUR 2,150,000.00). 
• 
Interest rate: it is assumed to remain constant at 4.144%. 
• 
Repayment of principal designed for financing the expenses of setting up the Fund and issuing

26, 2010 (inclusive). The remaining principal is repaid on the first Payment Date. 
 
e) Cash Reserve. 
• 
Amount: EUR 28,100,000.00. It is assumed that the weighted average margin applicable to the Party 
B interest rate in each of the Interest Swap Agreements is above 0%

Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores may have any legal effect whatsoever or be taken into account with respect to the Bond Issue. 
 
 
95 
 
• 
Reduction: it is assumed that its amount may be decreased down to the Required Cash Reserve on 
each Payment Date. 
 
f)  Expenses, fees and margin. 
i) 
Servicing  Agreement fee: 0.01% per annum on the average daily Outstanding Balance of the 
Mortgage Loans during each relevant Interest Accrual Period, inclusive of VAT if there is no 
exemption.  
ii) 
Financial Intermediation Margin: variable amount to be settled quarterly on each Payment Date, and 
to accrue upon the expiration of each quarterly period in an amount equal to the positive difference, if 
any, between the Fund’s income and expenditure as of the last day of the calendar month preceding 
each Payment Date. 
iii) 
Management Company Fee: variable amount equal to 0.012% per annum on the Outstanding 
Principal Balance of the Bond Issue, and fixed amount of EUR 10,500 on each Payment Date, up to 
a maximum on each of the quarterly Payment Dates of EUR 37,500.  
iv) 
Annual expenses of the Fund for auditing accounts, monitoring the rating and publishing notices, 
approximately EUR 25,380.80 and an assumed yearly Retail Price Index of 2.5%. 
v) 
Bond Paying Agent Fee: 0.01% on the amount to be distributed to Bondholders on each Payment 
Date. 
 
V.1.2 
Analysis of and comments on the impact that potential changes in the assumptions described in the 
preceding point would have on the financial balance of the Fund. 
In order to hedge the contingent credit risk due to delinquency and default on the Mortgage Loans, it has been 
resolved to set up a Cash Reserve, initially provisioned with the payment for subscribing for the Series E 
Bonds in order to fulfil on each Payment Date, upon a shortage of Available Funds, certain of the Fund’s 
payment or withholding obligations, which include payment of interest and principal on the Bonds. Moreover, 
the deferred interest payment and principal repayment between the Bonds in the different Series derived from 
their position in the application of the Available Funds and from the rules for Distribution of Available Funds for 
Amortisation between Series A, B, C and D in the Priority of Payments or in the application of the Liquidation 
Available Funds in the Liquidation Priority of Payments, is a mechanism for distinctly hedging the different 
Series. 
 
The base interest risk resulting in the Fund between Mortgage Loan interest, floating with different benchmark 
indices (mortgage market 1-year Mibor/Euribor), or fixed, as the case may be, as a result of subsequent 
renegotiations, and different revision periods and instalment settlement date, and the floating interest on the 
Bond Issue based on 3-month Euribor and with quarterly accrual and settlement periods, is neutralised by 
means of the Interest Swap, which does not neutralise the credit risk remaining in the Fund, since calculation 
of amounts payable and receivable by the Fund is based on a single notional which includes the Outstanding 
Balance of Mortgage Loans in good standing in payment of amounts due and with a default over a term not in 
excess of eighteen (18) months. 
 
As for the incidence the prepayment of the Mortgage Loans might have on the Bonds, section II.12.a) of this 
Offering Circular contains a table showing the performance as to average life and duration of the Bonds for 
different effective constant annual early amortisation or prepayment rates (CPRs). 
 
In general, the quality of the Mortgage Loans and the mechanisms and financial hedge transactions in place 
for maintaining the financial balance of the Fund are such that they have been considered sufficient by the 
Rating Agencies to assign the ratings to each of the Bond Series contained in section II.3 of this Offering 
Circular. These ratings express the Rating Agencies’ opinion about the Fund’s capacity to meet interest 
payments as they fall due on each set Payment Date and principal repayment during the life of the Fund and, 
in any event, by the Final Maturity Date.

V.1.3 
Number outline of the cash flows of funds. 
The number outline set forth hereinafter relates to collections and payments derived from the application of a 
cash policy, for ease of understanding of the investor, though in accordance with the provisions of section V.2 
of this Offering Circular, the Fund will apportion income and expenditure in time in accordance with the 
accruals principle. 
 
This outline is based not only on the assumptions referred to in section V.1.1 above but also on those 
assumptions remaining constant throughout the life of the Fund, whereas it is well-known that the relevant 
variables, particularly interest rates of the Bonds in all Series, and actual interest rates and delinquency, 
default and prepayment rates of the Mortgage Loans are subject to continual changes. 
 
Now, therefore, the value of that number outline is merely illustrative.

determined for each Interest Accrual Period. The accrued interest to be settled on January 25, April 25, July 
25 and October 25 in each year, shall be calculated based on: (i) the exact number of days in each interest 
accrual period, and (ii) a three-hundred-and-sixty (360-) day year. The first interest settlement date shall be 
July 25, 2005. 
 
In the event that the rating of the unsubordinated and unsecured short-term debt of BANCAJA should, at any 
time during the life of the Bonds, fall below P-1 or F1 respectively in Moody’s and Fitch’s rating scales, the 
Management Company shall within not more than thirty (30) days from the time of the occurrence of any such 
circumstances put in place, after notifying the Rating Agencies, any of the options described hereinafter 
allowing a suitable level of guarantee to be maintained with respect to the commitments derived from this 
Agreement in order for the rating given to the Bonds by the Rating Agencies not to be adversely affected: 
 
a) Obtaining from an institution having a credit rating for its unsubordinated and unsecured short-term debt of 
at least P-1 and F1 respectively in Moody’s and Fitch’s rating scales, a first demand guarantee securing 
for the Fund, merely upon the Management Company so requesting, prompt payment by BANCAJA of its 
obligation to repay the amounts deposited in the Treasury Account, during the time over which the loss of 
the P-1 or F1 ratings is maintained by BANCAJA. 
 
b) Transferring the Fund’s Treasury Account to an institution whose unsubordinated and unsecured short-
term debt has a rating of at least P-1 and F1 respectively in Moody’s and Fitch’s rating scales, arranging 
the highest possible yield for its balances, which may differ from that arranged with BANCAJA under this 
Agreement. 
 
c) If options a) and b) above are not possible, obtaining from BANCAJA or a third party collateral security in 
favour of the Fund on financial assets with a credit quality of not less than that of Spanish State 
Government Debt (Deuda Pública del Estado Español), in an amount sufficient to guarantee the 
commitments established in this Agreement.

106 
 
d) Moreover, if the above options should not be feasible on the set terms, the Management Company may 
invest the balances for periods not extending beyond the following Payment Date, in short-term fixed-
income assets in euros issued by institutions having ratings of at least P-1 and F1 for unsubordinated and 
unsecured short-term debt respectively in Moody’s and Fitch’s rating scales, including short-term securities 
issued by the Spanish State, in which case the yield obtained could also differ from that obtained initially 
with BANCAJA under this Agreement. 
 
e) In both events b) and d), the Management Company shall subsequently transfer the balances back to 
BANCAJA under the Guaranteed Interest Rate Account (Treasury Account) Agreement, in the event that 
BANCAJA’S unsubordinated and unsecured short-term debt should again attain the P-1 and F1 ratings 
respectively in Moody’s and Fitch’s above-mentioned scales. 
 
The ratings for BANCAJA’s unsubordinated and unsecured debt currently given by Moody’s and Fitch are 
respectively P-1 and F1 for short-term debt and A1 and A+ for long-term debt. 
 
The Guaranteed Interest Rate Account (Treasury Account) Agreement partly mitigates the risk relating to the 
timing difference between the Fund’s receipts of principal and interest on the Mortgage Loans, the periodicity 
of which differs from the quarterly amortisation and interest payment on the Bonds. 
 
V.3.2  
Start-Up Loan Agreement. 
The Management Company shall, for and on behalf of the Fund, enter with BANCAJA into a commercial loan 
agreement amounting to EUR five million one hundred and fifty thousand (5,150,000.00) (the “Start-Up Loan 
Agreement”) which shall be drawn down on the Closing Date and be allocated to financing the expenses of 
setting up the Fund and issuing the Bonds and financing partially the subscription for the Pass-Through 
Certificates and covering the timing difference existing between collection of Pass-Through Certificate interest 
and payment of Bond interest on the first Payment Date. 
 
The Start-Up Loan will accrue an annual nominal interest, determined quarterly for each Interest Accrual 
Period, which shall be the result of adding: (i) the Reference Rate determined for the Bonds, and (ii) a 2.00% 
margin. This interest will be payable only if the Fund should have sufficient liquidity in the Fund Priority of 
Payments or Liquidation Priority of Payments. Interest shall be settled and payable on the date of expiration of 
each Interest Accrual Period on each of the Payment Dates, and shall be calculated based on: (i) the exact 
number of days in each Interest Accrual Period and (ii) a three-hundred-and-sixty- (360-) day year. The first 
interest settlement date shall be July 26, 2005 because July 25, 2005 is not a Business Day. 
 
Interest accrued and not paid on a Payment Date will be accumulated and accrue late-payment interest at the 
same ordinary interest rate as the Start-Up Loan interest and will be paid, provided that the Fund has sufficient 
liquidity, and in the Priority of Payments, on the following Payment Date and in the same place provided for 
payment of ordinary interest on the Start-Up Loan in accordance with the Priority of Payments. 
 
Repayment will be effected quarterly on each of the Payment Dates as follows: 
 
(i) 
The portion of Start-Up Loan principal actually used to finance the Fund constitution and Bond issue 
expenses, finance partially the subscription for the Pass-Through Certificates and cover the timing 
difference existing between collection of Pass-Through Certificate interest and payment of Bond interest 
on the first Payment Date shall be repaid in twenty (20) consecutive quarterly instalments in an equal 
amount, on each Payment Date, the first of which shall be the first Payment Date, July 26, 2005 
because July 25, 2005 is not a Business Day, and the following until the Payment Date falling on April 
25, 2010, inclusive.  
 
(ii)   The portion of Start-Up Loan principal not used, as the case may be, shall be repaid on the first 
Payment Date, July 26, 2005 because July 25, 2005 is not a Business Day. 
 
In the event that the Fund should not have sufficient liquidity, in the Priority of Payments, on a Payment Date 
to proceed to the partial repayment falling due on the Start-Up Loan, then the portion of principal not repaid 
shall be repaid on the following Payment Date along with the amount that should be repaid on that same 
Payment Date, as the case may be, until it is fully repaid.

107 
 
Payment of amounts not paid on preceding Payment Dates shall take precedence over amounts falling due 
under the Start-Up Loan on that Payment Date, satisfying in the first place overdue interest and secondly 
repayment of principal, in the Fund Priority of Payments or Liquidation Priority of Payments, as the case may 
be. 
 
V.3.3 
Interest Swap Agreements. 
The Management Company shall, for and on behalf of the Fund, enter with DEUTSCHE BANK AG London 
Branch, into two floating interest rate swap agreements (the “Interest Swap Agreements” or the “Interest 
Swaps”) both of which shall be entered into based on the standard 1992 ISDA Master Agreement 
(Multicurrency-Cross Border) and the 2000 definitions (ISDA 2000 Definitions) of the International Swap 
Dealers Association, Inc. (“ISDA”) (the “Master Agreement”), the most relevant characteristics of which are 
described below. 
 
The two Interest Swap Agreements shall be entered into under the Master Agreement. The first agreement 
shall contain a floating interest rate swap agreement whereby the Fund and DEUTSCHE BANK shall make 
each other payments calculated on the outstanding balance of Mortgage Loans whose interest rate is revised 
annually, respectively applying the 12-month Euribor rate and the Reference Rate determined for the Bonds, 
the foregoing as described in the following subparagraphs (the “Interest Swap Agreement (Annual)”). The 
second agreement shall contain a floating  interest rate swap agreement whereby the Fund and DEUTSCHE 
BANK shall make each other payments calculated on the outstanding balance of Mortgage Loans whose 
interest rate is revised every six months, respectively applying the 12-month Euribor rate and the Reference 
Rate determined for the Bonds, the foregoing as described in the following subparagraphs (the “Interest 
Swap Agreement (Six-Monthly)”). 
 
The ratings for DEUTSCHE BANK’s unsubordinated and unsecured debt currently given by Moody’s and Fitch 
are respectively P-1 and F1+ for short-term debt and Aa3 and AA- for long-term debt. 
 
The Interest Swap Agreement shall expire on the earlier of the following Payment Dates: 
(i) the Final Maturity Date ; or 
(ii) the date on which Early Liquidation of the Fund ends in accordance with section III.7.1.4 of this 
Offering Circular when the Fund’s remaining assets have all been liquidated and the Liquidation 
Available Funds have all been distributed, in the Fund Liquidation Priority of Payments.

6.  
Events of default particular to the Interest Swap Agreements. 
The schedule to the Master Agreement and therefore applicable to both Interest Swap Agreements shall 
determine that if on a Payment Date of either Interest Swap Agreement the Fund (Party A) should not 
have sufficient liquidity to make payment of the full net amount, if any, payable to Party B, under either 
Interest Swap Agreement, the portion of this net amount not paid shall be settled on the following 
Payment Date provided that the Fund has sufficient liquidity in the Priority of Payments. Should such 
event of non-payment under either Interest Swap Agreement occur on two consecutive Payment Dates, 
the Interest Swap Agreements shall be terminated (Termination). In this event, the Fund (Party A) shall 
accept the obligation to pay the settlement amount established to which it is bound on the terms of the 
relevant Interest Swap Agreements, the foregoing in the Priority of Payments. Should the settlement 
amount under the relevant Interest Swap Agreement be a payment obligation for Party B and not for the 
Fund (Party A), Party B shall take over the obligation to pay the settlement amount provided for in the 
relevant Interest Swap Agreement. 
The schedule to the Master Agreement shall also determine that if on a Payment Date of either Interest 
Swap Agreement Party B should not make payment of the full amount payable to the Fund (Party A), 
under either Interest Swap Agreement, the Management Company, for and on behalf of the Fund, may 
choose to terminate the relevant Interest Swap Agreement (Termination). In that event, Party B shall 
accept the obligation to pay the settlement amount established in the relevant Interest Swap Agreement. 
Should the settlement amount under the relevant Interest Swap Agreement be due by the Fund (Party A) 
and not by Party B, payment thereof by the Fund (Party A) shall be made in the Priority of Payments. 
 
Without prejudice to the foregoing, other than in an event of permanent financial imbalance of the Fund, 
the Management Company shall endeavour, for and on behalf of the Fund, to enter into a new swap 
agreement. 
 
7.  
Actions in the event of change in the rating of Party B. 
(i) 
Fitch Criteria 
If either the long-term, unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of Party B or any Credit 
Support Provider from time to time in respect of Party B (or its successor) cease to be rated at 
least as high as A (or its equivalent) by Fitch or the short-term debt obligations of Party B (or its 
successor) or any credit support provider from time to time in respect of Party B cease to be rated 
at least as high as F1 (or its equivalent) by Fitch and, as a result of such cessation, the then 
current rating of the Bonds is downgraded or placed under review for possible downgrade by

Fitch (an “Initial Fitch Rating Event”) then Party B will, on a reasonable efforts basis within 30 
days of the occurrence of such Initial Fitch Rating Event, at its own cost, either: 
 
(A) put in place an appropriate mark-to-market collateral agreement (which may be based on the 
credit support documentation published by ISDA, or otherwise, and relates to collateral in the 
form of cash or securities or both to be posted on a weekly basis) in support of its obligations 
under the Interest Swap Agreements provided that (a) the collateral amount will be 
determined on a basis which satisfies (but is no more onerous than) the Fitch Criteria as 
described in the relevant collateral agreement (the “Collateral Amount”), and (b) the 
Collateral Amount will not be required to exceed such amount as would be required (in 
accordance with the Fitch Criteria) to maintain or restore the rating of the Bonds at or to the 
level it would have been at immediately prior to such Initial Fitch Rating Event;  
 
(B) transfer all of its rights and obligations with respect to the Interest Swap Agreements to a 
replacement third party satisfactory to Party A (whose consent, not to be unreasonably 
withheld, will be given if Fitch confirms that such transfer would maintain the rating of the 
Bonds by Fitch at, or restore the rating of the Bonds by Fitch to, the level it would have been 
at immediately prior to such Initial Fitch Rating Event); 
 
(C) obtain a guarantee of its rights and obligations with respect to the Interest Swap Agreements 
from a third party satisfactory to Party A (whose consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, 
will be given if Fitch confirms that such guarantee would maintain the rating of the Bonds at, 
or restore the rating of the Bonds to, the level it would have been at immediately prior to such 
Initial Fitch Rating Event); or 
 
(D) take such other action as Party B may agree with Fitch as will result in the rating of the 
Bonds following the taking of such action being maintained at, or restored to, the level it 
would have been at immediately prior to such Initial Fitch Rating Event. 
 
If any of (i)(B), (i)(C) or (i) (D) above are satisfied at any time, all collateral (or the equivalent 
thereof, as appropriate) transferred by Party B pursuant to (i)(A) will be retransferred to Party B 
and Party B will not be required to transfer any additional collateral and the Threshold for Party B, 
as set out in the Credit Support Annex, shall revert to infinity. 
 
(ii) Fitch Criteria (continued) 
If either the long-term, unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of Party B (or its 
successor) or any Credit Support Provider from time to time in respect of Party B (or its 
successor) cease to be rated at least as high as BBB+ (or its equivalent) by Fitch or the short-
term debt obligations of Party B (or its successor) or any Credit Support Provider from time to 
time in respect of Party B (or its successor) cease to be rated at least as high as F2 (or its 
equivalent) by Fitch and, as a result of such cessation, the then current rating of the Bonds is 
downgraded or placed under review for possible downgrade by Fitch (a “First Subsequent Fitch 
Rating Event”) then Party B will either: 
 
(A) continue to comply with the terms of, or, within 30 days of the occurrence of such First 
Subsequent Fitch Rating Event and at its own cost, put in place, as the case may be, a 
mark-to-market collateral agreement as described in paragraph (i)(A) above and provide any 
collateral required to be provided thereunder, provided that in either case the mark-to-market 
calculations and the correct and timely posting of collateral thereunder are verified by an 
independent third party (with the costs of such independent verification being borne by Party 
B); or 
 
(B) on a reasonable efforts basis within 30 days of the occurrence of such First Subsequent 
Fitch Rating Event, at its own cost, attempt either to: 
 
1. 
transfer all of its rights and obligations with respect to the Interest Swap Agreements to 
a replacement third party satisfactory to Party A (whose consent, not to be 
unreasonably withheld, will be given if Fitch confirms that such transfer would maintain 
the rating of the Bonds by Fitch at, or restore the rating of the Bonds by Fitch to, the

level it would have been at immediately prior to such First Subsequent Fitch Rating 
Event); 
 
2. 
obtain a guarantee of its rights and obligations with respect to the Interest Swap 
Agreements from a third party satisfactory to Party A (whose consent, not to be 
unreasonably withheld, will be given if Fitch confirms that such guarantee would 
maintain the rating of the Bonds at, or restore the rating of the Bonds to, the level it 
would have been at immediately prior to such First Subsequent Fitch Rating Event); or 
 
3. 
take such other action as Party B may agree with Fitch as will result in the rating of the 
Bonds following the taking of such action being maintained at, or restored to, the level it 
would have been at immediately prior to such First Subsequent Fitch Rating Event. 
 
If any of paragraphs (ii)(B)(1), (2) or (3) above are satisfied at any time, all collateral (or the 
equivalent thereof, as appropriate) transferred by Party B pursuant to a mark-to-market collateral 
agreement put in place in accordance with paragraph (i) (A) above or paragraph (ii) (A) will be 
retransferred to Party B and Party B will not be required to transfer any additional collateral. 
 
(iii) Fitch Criteria (continued) 
If either the long-term, unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of Party B (or its 
successor) or any Credit Support Provider from time to time in respect of Party B (or its 
successor) cease to be rated at least as high as BBB (or its equivalent) by Fitch or the short-term 
debt obligations of Party B (or its successor) or any Credit Support Provider from time to time in 
respect of Party B (or its successor) cease to be rated at least as high as F3 (or its equivalent) by 
Fitch and, as a result of such cessation, the then current rating of the Bonds is downgraded or 
placed under review for possible downgrade by Fitch (a “Second Subsequent Fitch Rating 
Event”) then Party B will, on a reasonable efforts basis within 30 days of the occurrence of such 
Second Subsequent Fitch Rating Event, at its own cost, attempt either to: 
 
(A) transfer all of its rights and obligations with respect to the Interest Swap Agreements to a 
replacement third party satisfactory to Party A (whose consent, not to be unreasonably 
withheld, will be given if Fitch confirms that such transfer would maintain the rating of the 
Bonds by Fitch at, or restore the rating of the Bonds by Fitch to, the level it would have been 
at immediately prior to such Second Subsequent Fitch Rating Event); 
 
(B) obtain a guarantee of its rights and obligations with respect to the Interest Swap Agreements 
from a third party satisfactory to Party A (whose consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, 
will be given if Fitch confirms that such guarantee would maintain the rating of the Bonds at, 
or restore the rating of the Bonds to, the level it would have been at immediately prior to such 
Second Subsequent Fitch Rating Event); or 
 
(C) take such other action as Party B may agree with Fitch as will result in the rating of the 
Bonds following the taking of such action being maintained at, or restored to, the level it 
would have been at immediately prior to such Second Subsequent Fitch Rating Event. 
 
Pending compliance with any of paragraphs (iii)(A), (B) or (C) above, Party B will continue to 
comply with the terms of any mark-to-market collateral agreement put in place in accordance with 
paragraph (i)(A) or (ii)(A) above or, within 10 days of the occurrence of the Second Subsequent 
Fitch Rating Event and at its own cost, put in place such an agreement (provided that the mark-
to-market calculations and the correct and timely posting of collateral thereunder are verified by 
an independent third party (with the costs of such independent verification being borne by Party 
B)).  If any of paragraphs (iii)(A), (B) or (C) above are satisfied at any time, all collateral (or the 
equivalent thereof, as appropriate) transferred by Party B under such a mark-to-market collateral 
agreement will be retransferred to Party B and Party B will not be required to transfer any 
additional collateral. 
 
All the confirmations of the ratings of the Bonds to be requested to Fitch, in accordance with 
paragraphs (i)(A), (i)(B), (ii)(B)(1), (ii)(B)(2), (iii)(A) and (iii)(B) above shall be requested by Party 
A.

(iv) Moody's Criteria 
In the event that: 
 
(1)  (aa) the long-term, unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of Party B (or its 
successor) cease to be rated at least as high as A1 (or its equivalent) by Moody’s; or

Support Provider of Party B cease to be rated as high as A1 (or its equivalent) by Moody's or 
its short-term, unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations cease to be rated as high as 
P-1 (or its equivalent) by Moody's,  
 
such cessation being a "Downgrade Event", then Party B will within 30 days and at its own cost, 
do one of the following: 
 
(A) transfer all of its rights and obligations with respect to the Interest Swap Agreements to a 
replacement third party with the Required Ratings (as defined below) providing that such 
transfer does not result in any requirement for deduction or withholding for or on account of 
any Tax; or 
 
(B) procure another person with the Required Ratings to become co-obligor in respect of the 
obligations of Party B under the Interest Swap Agreements providing that such does not 
result in any requirement for deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax; or 
 
(C) post collateral to Party A as per Moody’s Criteria, in an account whose arranger short-term, 
unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations it is at least of Prime-1 by Moody’s rating,  
as set out in the Credit Support Annex annexed to the Interest Swap Agreements (please 
refer to paragraph 11(b)(iii)(B)(a) of the Credit Support Annex), in support of its obligations 
under the Interest Swap Agreements. 
 
If any of (iv)(A) or (iv)(B) above are satisfied at any time, all collateral (or the equivalent thereof, 
as appropriate) transferred by Party B pursuant to (iv)(C) will be retransferred to Party B and 
Party B will not be required to transfer any additional collateral and the Threshold for Party B, as 
set out in the Credit Support Annex, shall revert to infinity. 
 
(v) Moody's Criteria (continued) (“Second Downgrade Event”) 
In the event that: 
 
(aa) the long-term, unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of Party B (or its successor) 
and, if relevant, any Credit Support Provider of Party B, cease to be rated at least as high as 
Baa2 (or its equivalent) by Moody’s; or  
 
(bb) the short-term, unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of Party B (or its successor) 
and, if relevant, any Credit Support Provider of Party B, cease to be rated at least as high as 
P-2 (or its equivalent) by Moody’s, or 
 
(cc) the retirement of all the ratings granted to Party B by Moody’s 
 
such cessation being a "Second Downgrade Event", then Party B will, as soon as reasonably 
practicable, on a best efforts basis, in any case within 30 days of the Second Downgrade Event  
and at its own cost, do one of A or B below:

(A) transfer all of its rights and obligations with respect to the Interest Swap Agreements to a 
replacement third party with the Required Ratings providing that such transfer does not 
result in any requirement for deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax; or 
 
(B) procure another person with the Required Ratings to become co-obligor in respect of the 
obligations of Party B under the Interest Swap Agreements providing that such does not 
result in any requirement for deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax.  
 
(C) And, additionally, within 10 days of the occurrence of such Second Downgrade Event under 
item (v), if Party B has taken none of the actions specified in (v)(A) or (B) above, Party B 
shall post collateral as per Moody’s Criteria, in an account whose arranger short-term, 
unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations it is at least of P-1 by Moody’s rating, set 
out in the Credit Support Annex annexed to the Interest Swap Agreements and the 
Threshold for Party B shall be as set out in paragraph 11(b)(iii)(B)(b) provided that Party B 
shall continue, on a best efforts basis, to make all reasonable attempts to take the actions 
specified in (v)(A) or (B) above.   
 
If any of (v)(A) or (v)(B) are satisfied at any time, all collateral (or the equivalent thereof, as 
appropriate) transferred by Party B pursuant to (v)(C) will be retransferred to Party B and Party B 
will not be required to transfer any additional collateral and the Threshold for Party B, as set out 
in the Credit Support Annex, shall revert to infinity. 
 
For the purposes of (iv) and (v), "Required Ratings" means in respect of the relevant entity, its 
long-term, unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations are rated at least as high as A1 and 
its short-term unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations are rated at least as high as P-1 
by Moody’s or such other ratings as may be agreed with Moody’s from time to time. 
 
(vi) If Party B does not take any of the measures described in either (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) (except for 
(v)(C)) above such failure shall not be or give rise to an Event of Default but shall constitute an 
Additional Termination Event with respect to Party B and shall be deemed to have occurred on 
the thirtieth day following such downgrade with Party B as the sole Affected Party and all 
Transactions shall be Affected Transactions. 
 
If Party B does not take the measure described in (v) C above, such failure shall constitute an 
Event of Default with respect to Party B. 
 
(vii) Further, it shall constitute an Additional Termination Event with respect to Party B if, even after 
satisfying the requirements of collateral posting, Party B has failed within 30 days of a 
Subsequent Moody’s Rating Event to either: 
 
(A) transfer all of its rights and obligations with respect to the Interest Swap Agreements to a 
replacement third party with the Required Ratings providing that such transfer does not result 
in any requirement for deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax; or 
 
(B) procure another person with the Required Ratings to become co-obligor in respect of the 
obligations of Party B under the Interest Swap Agreements providing that such does not 
result in any requirement for deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax;  
 
and such Additional Termination Event shall be deemed to have occurred on the thirtieth day 
following such Subsequent Moody’s Rating Event with Party B as the sole Affected Party and all 
Transactions shall be Affected Transactions.    
 
(“Additional Termination Event” is a concept defined in the Master Agreement for the Interest 
Swap Agreements which shall result in the relevant Interest Swap Agreement being terminated if 
the Management Company , for and on behalf of the Fund (Party A), should decide this.) 
 
(“Event of Default” (Event of Default) is a concept defined in the Master Agreement for the 
Interest Swap Agreements which shall result in the relevant Interest Swap Agreement being 
automatically terminated early.)

116 
 
In both Termination events, Party B shall accept the obligation to pay the settlement amount 
provided for in the relevant Interest Swap Agreement. Should the settlement amount under the 
relevant Interest Swap Agreement be due by the Fund (Party A) and not by Party B, payment 
thereof by the Fund (Party A) shall be made in the Priority of Payments. 
 
(viii) Party A shall use its reasonable endeavours to co-operate with Party B in putting in place such 
credit support documentation, including agreeing to such arrangements in such documentation as 
may satisfy Fitch and Moody’s with respect to the operation and management of the collateral 
and entering into such documents as may reasonably be requested by Party A in connection with 
the provision of such collateral. 
 
(ix) If more than one of the ratings criteria applies to Party B, the measures adopted by Party B shall 
satisfy the ratings criteria established above by both Fitch and Moody’s. 
 
8.  
Other characteristics of the Interest Swap Agreements. 
8.1 Additional Termination Events: 
(i) With respect to Party A only: any amendment of the Deed of Constitution resulting in an adverse 
change in the position of payments to Party B in the Priority of Payments or in the Liquidation Priority 
of Payments, relative to the Bonds such that payments to Party B rank pari passu with some or all of 
the Bond Series or rank junior to any or all of the Bond Series. In this connection, Party A shall be the 
sole Affected Party. 
(ii) With respect to Party A and Party B: where (A) there is default on payment of Series A Bond interest 
and (B) the Management Company notifies, in accordance with the provisions of section III.7.1.2 of 
this Offering Circular, the Early Liquidation of the Fund in the Early Liquidation Event established in 
section III.7.1.1 (iv). In this connection, both Parties shall be Affected Parties. For the purposes of the 
provisions of section 6 (e) (ii) of the Master Agreement, Party A shall be deemed to be the sole 
Affected Party.  
 
“Additional Termination Event” is a concept defined in the Master Agreement for the Interest Swap 
Agreements which shall result in the relevant Interest Swap Agreement being terminated (i) if Party B 
should decide this in event (i) above, or (ii) if the Management Company, for and on behalf of the Fund 
(Party A), or Party B should decide this in event (ii) above. 
 
In both Termination events, Party B shall accept the obligation to pay the settlement amount provided for 
in the relevant Interest Swap Agreement. Should the settlement amount under the relevant Interest Swap 
Agreement be due by the Fund (Party A) and not by Party B, payment thereof by the Fund (Party A) shall 
be made in the Priority of Payments or in the Liquidation Priority of Payments, as the case may be. 
 
8.2 Party B may only assign all its rights and obligations under the Interest Swap Agreements, subject to 
Party A’s consent, to a third party whose credit ratings for its unsubordinated and unsecured debt 
obligations are equal to or in excess of A-1 and A for its long-term debt obligations respectively by 
Moody’s and Fitch, and F1 for its short-term debt obligations by Fitch. 
 
8.2 The Interest Swap Agreements shall be submitted to Spanish law. 
 
8.2 The Interest Swap Agreements shall be fully terminated in the event that the Rating Agencies should not 
confirm the provisional ratings assigned to each of the Series as final by the start of the Subscription 
Period. 
 
The occurrence, as the case may be, of the Termination of any of the Interest Swap Agreements will not in 
itself be an Early Amortisation event of the Bond Issue and an Early Liquidation event of the Fund referred to 
in sections II.11.4 and III.7.1 of this Offering Circular, unless in conjunction with other events or circumstances 
related to the net asset value of the Fund, its financial balance should be materially or permanently altered. 
 
The execution of the Interest Swap Agreements derives from the need to mitigate the interest rate risk (base 
risk) occurring in the Fund because the Mortgage Loans are subject to floating interest with different 
benchmark indices and different review and settlement periods at the floating interest established for the 
Bonds based on 3-month Euribor and with quarterly accrual and settlement periods.

V.3.4  
Bond Paying Agent Agreement. 
The Management Company shall, for and on behalf of the Fund, enter with BANCAJA into a paying agent 
agreement to service the Bonds issued by the Fund (the “Paying Agent Agreement”). 
 
The obligations to be taken on by BANCAJA (the “Paying Agent”) under this Paying Agent Agreement are 
summarily as follows:  
(i) 
Paying to the Fund by 3pm (CET time) on the Closing Date, by crediting the Treasury Account, for same 
day value, the aggregate amount of the subscription for the Bond Issue received from the remaining 
Underwriters and Placement Agents in accordance with the provisions of the Bond Issue Management, 
Underwriting and Placement Agreement plus the face amount of the Bonds placed and, as the case may 
be, subscribed for on its own account, as Underwriter and Placement Agent. 
(ii) 
Paying to each of the Underwriters and Payment Agents on the Closing Date the underwriting and 
placement fee amount accrued in favour of each one, after they have in turn paid it the face amount of 
the Bonds they shall each have placed and, as the case may be, subscribed for on their own account up 
to their respective underwriting commitment. 
(iii) Handing to the Management Company Bond Issue placement dissemination control information based 
on the information provided in that connection by the Underwriters and Placement Agents, using for that 
purpose the form duly established by the CNMV. 
(iv) On each of the Bond Payment Dates, paying interest and, as the case may be, repaying principal on the 
Bonds, deducting the total amount of the tax withholding for return on investments that should be made 
in accordance with applicable tax laws. 
(v) 
On each of the Interest Rate Fixing Dates, notifying the Management Company of the Reference Rate 
determined to be used as the basis for calculating the Nominal Interest Rate applicable to each of the 
Bond Series. 
  
In the event of the credit ratings assigned to BANCAJA falling or for any other duly justified reason which may 
be detrimental to the ratings granted to the Bonds by the Rating Agencies, the Management Company may 
revoke the appointment of BANCAJA as Paying Agent, and shall thereupon designate a substitute institution. 
Should BANCAJA be replaced as Paying Agent, the Management Company shall be entitled to change the 
fee payable to the substitute institution, which may be higher than that established with BANCAJA under the 
Paying Agent Agreement. 
 
In consideration of the services provided by the Paying Agent, the Fund shall pay it a fee of 0.01%, inclusive 
of taxes as the case may be, on the amount to be distributed to Bondholders on each Bond Payment Date 
during the term of the Paying Agent Agreement, payable on the same Payment Date, provided that the Fund 
has sufficient liquidity in the Priority of Payments or the Liquidation Priority of Payments, as the case may be. 
 
In the event that the Fund should not have sufficient liquidity to pay said full fee, then the amounts accrued 
and not paid shall be accumulated without any penalty whatsoever to the fee falling due on the following 
Payment Date, unless that absence of liquidity should continue, in which case the amounts due shall build up 
until fully paid on the Payment Date on which that situation is no longer current. 
 
The Paying Agent Agreement shall be fully terminated in the event that the Rating Agencies should not 
confirm the provisional ratings assigned to each of the Series as final by the start of the Subscription Period. 
 
V.3.5 
Financial Intermediation Agreement. 
The Management Company shall, for and on behalf of the Fund, enter with the Originator into a Financial 
Intermediation Agreement designed to remunerate the Originator for the financial intermediation process 
carried out, enabling the financial transformation defining the Fund’s activity, the subscription by the Fund for 
the Pass-Through Certificates and the rating assigned to each of the Bond Series. 
 
The Originator shall be entitled to receive from the Fund a variable subordinated remuneration which shall be 
determined and shall accrue upon the expiration of every quarterly accrual period, comprising, other than for 
the first period, the three calendar months preceding each Payment Date, in an amount equal to the positive 
difference, if any, between the income and expenditure, including losses, if any, brought forward from previous

118 
 
years, accrued by the Fund with reference to its accounts and before the close of the months of March, June, 
September and December, which are the last month in each quarterly period. Exceptionally, the first period 
shall be comprised between the Fund constitution date and June 30, 2005, inclusive, this being the last day of 
the month preceding the first Payment Date, July 26, 2005 because July 25, 2005 is not a Business Day. 
 
The variable remuneration accrued at the close of the months of March, June, September and December shall 
be settled on the Payment Date immediately following the last day of each of said months, provided that the 
Fund has sufficient liquidity in the Priority of Payments. 
 
If the Fund should not have sufficient liquidity on a Payment Date in the Priority of Payments to pay the full 
remuneration, the variable remuneration amount accrued and not paid shall accumulate without any penalty 
whatsoever on the variable remuneration accrued, as the case may be, in the following quarterly period in the 
Priority of Payments. 
 
The Financial Intermediation Agreement shall be fully terminated in the event that the Rating Agencies should 
not confirm any of the provisional ratings assigned to each of the Bond Series as final by the start of the 
Subscription Period. 
 
 
V.4

CHAPTER VII 
 
 
 
RECENT EVOLUTION AND PROSPECTS OF THE MORTGAGE MARKET IN GENERAL AND OF THE 
MORTGAGE LOAN MARKET IN PARTICULAR WHICH MIGHT AFFECT THE FINANCIAL PROSPECTS 
OF THE FUND 
 
 
 
 
VII.1  
Most recent significant trends in the Mortgage Market in general and of the mortgage loan market in 
particular in relation to the legal framework, with the development of interest rates, and prepayment 
and delinquency rates. 
The Spanish mortgage market has in recent years undergone a major transformation both in regard to its laws 
and the prevailing interest of credit institutions in developing and increasing their interest in the market, and as 
a result of factors inherent in the development of the market proper (interest rates, demand for credit and price 
of housing). The most significant elements in the recent evolution of the Spanish market are described 
hereinafter in this section. 
 
Mortgage credit. 
In January 2005, mortgage credit came to have an outstanding balance of EUR 541,288 millions, 54.5% in the 
investment portfolio of Savings Banks and 38.40% in that of banks. From early 1998, mortgage credit has 
grown at an average pace in excess of 20% per annum. Consequent upon this strong boost, mortgage credit 
accounted for almost 55% of the total credit portfolio of financial institutions towards the end of January 2005.

The increased demand for mortgage credit was supported by the strong development of the housing market, 
resulting in more than a million transactions per annum since early 1998, and an increase in the average 
amount per mortgage, which has more than doubled over this period years, going from an average of EUR 
50,000 per mortgage in 1998 to EUR 133,000 on average in 2004.

128 
 
In the year 2004, the mortgage balance amounted to EUR 531,711 million, rising by 23.4% with respect to the 
year before. 
 
Interest rates. 
Upon the Spanish economy coming under the European Central Bank’s discipline, there was an outstanding 
drop in interest rates which was rapidly passed to the mortgage market. These enhanced financial terms have 
made it easier for families to buy a home, boosting the demand for residential homes. From the early nineties, 
mortgage interest rates in Spain have dropped to one-third and repayment terms have been extended to 25 
and 35 years. The reduced interest rates and extended credit terms has resulted in a significant drop in 
instalments paid by families for buying a home.

Real estate price increases have prevented the enhanced financing terms from being fully passed to the home 
accessibility ratios due to a significant real estate price increase. Overall, family monthly payments for buying 
a home have remained relatively consistent in proportion: although improved rates and extended terms result 
in lower monthly payments for a family buying a home, higher-priced homes have resulted in a greater credit 
amount being required, thereby increasing the monthly instalment. In terms of financial effort, monthly 
payments under a loan for buying an average home, using data for the third quarter of 2004, were equivalent 
to 31% of an average family’s total gross income, which were reduced to 25% when tax rebates were 
considered, for a 25-year medium-term financing. 
 
Delinquency. 
The mortgage market has been strongly boosted in these years in the midst of important risk management 
improvements resulting in mortgage delinquency of financial institutions as a whole being minimised.  
 
At present, finished home mortgage delinquency is currently at 0.314% of the total mortgage portfolio of credit 
institutions, very far from the 4% rate there was in 1993. As for the credit portfolio as a whole, mortgage 
delinquency stands at less than 50% of total delinquency (0.744%).

Regulatory changes. 
The object of most recent regulations has been to provide mortgagors with a greater power to negotiate the 
terms of loans, and reduce certain costs attached to loan renegotiation. In this sense, in addition to Mortgage 
Loan Subrogation and Amendment Act 2/1994, March 30 (making provision for the possibility of substituting 
and renegotiating the economic terms of loans, reducing both tax and fee costs, and reducing floating interest 
rate loan prepayment charges), two measures were taken designed to cheapen transaction costs in mortgage 
loan subrogation and amendment and novation transactions: on the one hand, the agreement made between 
the Economy Ministry and banks and savings banks, lowering charges; and on the other the approval of Royal 
Decree 2616/1996, December 20, modifying both notarial and registration fees in mortgage loan subrogation 
and novation transactions under that Act 2/1994. 
 
Prepayment. 
The substantial cut in interest rates in recent years along with an enhanced competitiveness among credit 
institutions in this segment of financing given its strategic character with a view to fidelising customers, has 
fostered a considerable increase in prepayment rates of mortgage loans remaining with interest rates in 
excess of those prevailing in the mortgage market from time to time, upon the failure by the lenders to 
renegotiate the financial terms. 
 
In any event, it should therefore be borne in mind that mortgage loan prepayment shall take place irrespective 
of said Mortgage Loan Subrogation and Amendment Act 2/1994, for the possibility or advisability of so doing 
shall be prompted not only by the facilities given in that connection but by such more determinant factors as 
mainly age and higher interest rate of the loans in relation to those offered from time to time. 
 
 
VII.2  
Implications that might derive from the trends remarked in the preceding point Vll.1 (prepayment rate, 
default rate, et cetera): 
The Mortgage Loans for the issue of the Pass-Through Certificates to be subscribed for by the Fund all have a 
floating interest rate and are adjusted from time to time to market interest rate variations. Because of this, a 
high prepayment rate of the Mortgage Loans is not to be expected. The provisions established for the 
renegotiation for determining the interest rate of Mortgage Loans that might be in upper ranges in relation to 
the market level from time to time should also be borne in mind.  
 
As for the obligors’ creditworthiness, as set forth in section IV.4.i), some of the provisional portfolio mortgage 
loans which shall back the issue of the Pass-Through Certificates were liable as of March 31, 2005 for arrears 
in payment of amounts due, which situation was checked, as explained in the audit report attached as 
Appendix V to this Offering Circular. The Mortgage Loans that will finally be assigned to the Fund by means of 
the issue of Pass-Through Certificates shall have no overdue amounts on the date of issue for a period in 
excess of one (1) month, pursuant to the representation by BANCAJA contained in section IV.1.1.2 (22).
