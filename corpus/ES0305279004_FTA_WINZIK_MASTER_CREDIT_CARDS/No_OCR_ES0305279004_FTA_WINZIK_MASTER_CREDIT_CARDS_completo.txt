RISK FACTORS 
1. RISKS DERIVED FROM THE ASSETS BACKING THE ISSUE 
1.1. 
Risk of non-payment by the Borrowers 
Neither Wizink BANK, S.A. (WIZINK) as seller of the Receivables to the Fund (the Seller), 
nor the Director, the Arrangers and the Joint Lead Managers or any global coordinator, lead 
manager, bookrunner or underwriter assumes any liability for non-payment by the individuals 
who have entered into such Credit Card Agreements as principal obligors to the Seller (the 
Borrowers and each of them a Borrower), whether for principal, interest or any other 
amount owed by virtue of the Receivables. The Receivables do not benefit from any personal 
guarantee or security.  
Each holder of a securitisation note (the Notes) issued by the Fund (a Noteholder) will bear 
the risk of non-payment by the Borrowers always taking into account the protection 
mechanisms described in section 3.4.3 of the Additional Building Block. 
Transfer of title to the Receivables will be complete and unconditional throughout the 
remaining repayment period until maturity of each Receivable. Pursuant to article 1,529 of the 
Civil Code and article 348 of the Commercial Code, the Seller will only be held liable 
vis-à-vis the Fund for the existence and legitimacy of the Receivables, in the terms 
and conditions declared in this Base Prospectus and the public deed of incorporation of the 
Fund (the Deed of Incorporation) that are set forth in this Base Prospectus, as well as for 
the legal status with which it carries out the sale.  
Likewise, the Seller will not grant collateral or bank guarantees, whether pursuant to the Deed 
of Incorporation, or to this Base Prospectus, or to any other agreement or contract to secure 
the payments under the Receivables by the Borrowers (subject to the in rem rights of pledge 
in favour of the Fund granted over the accounts opened by WIZINK in its capacity as servicer 
of the Purchased Receivables (the Servicer) with the Collections Account Bank for the 
purposes set out in section 3.4.3.9 of the Additional Building Block (the Collections 
Account) to reduce the commingling risk as described in section 3.4.3.9 of the Additional 
Building Block (see risk factor 3.4 in this regard)).  
All of this, without prejudice to (i) the Seller's obligation to repurchase the Purchased 
Receivables that do not comply with the applicable sale representations or, alternatively, 
indemnify the Fund where such repurchase is not possible, subject to and in accordance with 
the provisions set forth in section 2.2.9 of the Additional Building Block, (ii) the General 
Reserve and (iii) the Commingling Reserve described in sections 3.4.3.7 and 0 of the 
Additional Building Block, respectively. 
The Notes of any series (each a Note Series) do not represent or constitute an obligation of 
the Seller, the Director, any global coordinator, lead manager (including the Joint Lead 


 
 
 
12 
Managers), bookrunner or underwriter, the Eligible Hedging Counterparties or of the 
Management Company.  
No guarantees have been granted by any public or private entities, including the Seller, 
the Management Company, the Director, any global coordinator, lead manager (including the 
Joint Lead Managers), bookrunner or underwriter, the Eligible Hedging Counterparties, the 
Paying Agent, the Issuer Accounts Bank or any other firm affiliated with or invested by any 
of the above. 
1.2. 
The Seller may change the terms and conditions of the Credit Card Agreements, the 
Receivables and its Credit and Servicing Policies  
Although the legal title of the Receivables will be transferred by the Seller to the Fund, the 
Seller will continue to manage the Credit Cards under which the Receivables come into 
existence and will remain the contractual counterparty of the Borrowers under the Credit Card 
Agreements. As such, the Seller retains the right to change various terms and conditions of 
the Credit Cards (as governed by the related Credit Card Agreement), including the interest 
amounts and other fees it charges and the required minimum monthly payment in accordance 
with its usual business practices.  
The Seller may change the terms of the Credit Card Agreements in a manner which may 
reduce the amount of Receivables arising under the Credit Card Agreements, may reduce the 
amount of the Available Collections on those Receivables or otherwise may adversely alter 
payment patterns. Additionally, as described in section 1.3 below, the Seller may change the 
rate of periodic interest amounts. 
Additionally, the Seller shall be entitled to amend the Credit Card Agreements if such 
amendment (A) is the mandatory result of a final court resolution, (B) is imposed by any 
competent administrative or regulatory authority, (C) affects the interest rate or the fees, the 
instalment due date, the instalment amount and/or the maximum authorised credit amount to 
the extent permitted by the terms of such Credit Card Agreement, the usual Credit Policies 
and the Servicing Policies or (D) is required by applicable laws or regulations. 
Certain mechanisms have been introduced in the documentation to minimise the impact of 
such amendments to the Credit Card Agreement as described in section 3.4.3 of the 
Additional Building Block. 
Additionally, the Servicer shall be entitled to agree amendments or write-offs in relation to 
the Purchased Receivables in the context and within the limits set out in its servicing and 
management policies (the Servicing Policies), which could also imply a reduction the amount 
of the Available Collections on those Purchased Receivables or otherwise adversely alter 
payment patterns. 
In order to mitigate this risk, any such amendments are subject to certain limits and in some 
instances, to the payment of Seller Dilutions by the Seller to the Fund, as set out in section 
3.3.1.10 of the Additional Building Block.  


 
 
 
13 
In addition, the Seller may change its credit policies (the Credit Policies) and Servicing 
Policies, procedures and practices relating to the operation of its general credit business if 
such change is made applicable to the comparable segment of revolving credit accounts 
owned and serviced by the Seller.  
1.3. 
The Seller may change the interest payable under the Receivables 
The interest rate payable under the Receivables is contractually agreed between the Seller and 
the Borrower. In accordance with the information provided in section 2.2.2 of the Additional 
Building Block, the weighted average contractual nominal interest rate of the Audited 
Portfolio is 23.93%. For these purposes, Audited Portfolio means the aggregate of the 
Receivables audited by KPMG Auditores, S.L.P. (KPMG or the Auditor) from which the 
Receivables to be transferred to the Fund on the Fund Incorporation Date (or, as applicable, 
on any other Purchase Date during the life of the Fund) will be selected. 
The Seller may modify the terms and conditions of the Credit Card Agreements (including the 
interest rate applicable under the Receivables from time to time) after individually notifying 
the Borrower with the legally applicable prior notice to the proposed date of implementation 
of the amendments.  
In case that the Seller modifies the terms and conditions of the Credit Card Agreements 
reducing the interest rate applicable under the Receivables there would be a reduction of the 
amounts received by the Fund and consequently its capacity to honour its payments 
obligations under the Notes. 
Consequently, there can be no guarantee that the yield received following such a rate change 
will remain at the same level relative to the rate of interest payable by the Fund on the Notes. 
1.4. 
Interest Rate risk  
The Receivables to be purchased by the Fund bear an adjustable fixed interest rate while the 
Class A Notes and/or the Class B Notes and/or the Class C Notes of any Note Series may bear 
a floating rate of interest as specified in the relevant the Issuing Document. 
Consequently, the Fund may be exposed to an interest rate risk which may be hedged 
contractually (through the setting of a Maximum Interest Rate to the relevant Notes) or with 
any Class A Hedging Agreement on the issue of any Class A Floating Rate Notes, any Class 
B Hedging Agreement on the issue of any Class B Floating Rate Notes any Class C Hedging 
Agreement on the issue of any Class C Floating Rate Notes entered into between the Fund, 
represented by the Management Company, and any Eligible Hedging Counterparties. 
Where interest rate risk is hedged with any Hedging Agreement, during periods in which 
floating rate payments payable by any Eligible Hedging Counterparty under any Hedging 
Agreement are greater than the fixed rate payments payable by the Fund under the same 
Hedging Agreement, the Fund will be more dependent on receiving net payments from the 
Eligible Hedging Counterparty in order to make interest payments on the Notes of any Note 
Series bearing a floating interest rate.  


 
 
 
14 
If in such a period the Eligible Hedging Counterparty fails to pay any amounts when due 
under the Hedging Agreement, the Available Distribution Amount may not be sufficient to 
make all required payments on the Notes of any Note Series and the holders of such Notes 
may experience delays and/or reductions in the interest and principal payments on their 
Notes.  
During periods in which floating rate payments payable by any Eligible Hedging 
Counterparty under any Hedging Agreement are less than the fixed rate payments payable by 
the Fund under the same Hedging Agreement, the Fund will be obliged under the Hedging 
Agreement to make a net payment to the Eligible Hedging Counterparty.  
The Eligible Hedging Counterparty’s claims for payment (including certain termination 
payments required to be made by the Fund upon a termination of the Hedging Agreement) 
under the Hedging Agreement will rank higher in priority than all payments on the Class A 
Notes, the Class B Notes and the Class C Notes.  
If a net payment under any of the Hedging Agreement is due to any Eligible Hedging 
Counterparty on a Payment Date, the then Available Distribution Amount may be insufficient 
to make such net payment to the Eligible Hedging Counterparty and, in turn, interest and 
principal payments to the holders of Notes of any Note Series, so that the Noteholders may 
experience delays and/or reductions in the interest and principal payments on their Notes.  
The Fund is exposed to the risk that any Eligible Hedging Counterparty may become 
insolvent. In the event that any Eligible Hedging Counterparty suffers a rating downgrade 
below the required ratings, the Fund may terminate the relevant Hedging Agreement if the 
Eligible Hedging Counterparty fails, within a set period of time, to take certain actions 
intended to mitigate the effects of such downgrade. Such actions may include the Eligible 
Hedging Counterparty collateralising its obligations under the Hedging Agreement, 
transferring its obligations to a replacement interest rate swap counterparty having the 
required ratings or procuring that an entity with the required ratings becomes a co obligor 
with or guarantor of the Eligible Hedging Counterparty as further described in section 3.4.8.1 
of the Additional Building Block.  
However in the event any Eligible Hedging Counterparty is downgraded below the required 
ratings there can be no assurance that a co-obligor, guarantor or replacement interest rate 
swap counterparty will be found or that the amount of collateral provided will be sufficient to 
meet the Eligible Hedging Counterparty’s obligations.  
1.5. 
Credit Consumer protection law 
The Spanish Supreme Court has recently ruled (Judgment 628/2015 of 25 November) that 
contractual interest rates which are twice the "normal interest rates" are "usurious" and, 
therefore, illegal.  
 
When determining what is the "normal interest rate" of the money for these purposes, the 
Judgment resorted to the interest rate statistics published by the Bank of Spain, in accordance 


 
 
 
15 
with Regulation (EU) No 1072/2013 of the European Central Bank of 24 September 2013 and 
Bank of Spain Circular 1/2010 of 27 January). 
However, pursuant to such interest rate statistics, the interest rate of the Credit Cards 
Agreements of the Seller (the breakdown of which is included in section 2.2.2 of the 
Additional Building Block) is lower than twice the average TEDR interest rate (equivalent to 
TAE but without including fees) of credit cards for 2017 (which, according to the latest 
statistics 
published 
by 
the 
Bank 
of 
Spain 
available 
at 
http://www.bde.es/webbde/es/estadis/infoest/bolest19.html, 
is 
currently 
at 
20.74%). 
Therefore, it should not be considered "usurious" in accordance with the test set out in the 
Judgment. 
At present, a percentage equal to only 0.007% of Wizink accounts (calculated over the total 
portfolio amount potentially eligible for the Programme), are subject to claims regarding the 
interest rates applied over the Credit Cards Agreements. 
1.6. 
Searches, Investigations and Warranties in Relation to the Receivables  
The Seller will give certain warranties to the Fund regarding the Receivables sold to the Fund. 
See section 2.2.8 of the Additional Building Block in this regard. 
Neither the Management Company, the Fund, the Arrangers, the Director, the Global 
Coordinators, the Joint Lead Managers nor any Eligible Hedging Counterparties have 
undertaken, or will undertake, any investigations, searches or other actions of any nature 
whatsoever in respect of any Receivables in the Audited Portfolio or to establish the 
creditworthiness of any Borrowers and each relies instead on the warranties given by the 
Seller which are disclosed in section 2.2.8 of the Additional Building Block.  
As such, the Receivables may be subject to matters which would have been revealed by a full 
investigation or, if incapable of remedy had such matters been revealed. The primary remedy 
of the Fund against the Seller if any of the warranties made by the Seller is materially 
breached or proves to be materially untrue as at the Purchase Date which breach is not 
remedied will be to require the Seller to repurchase any relevant Receivable in accordance 
with the repurchase provisions in the Master Receivables Sale and Purchase Agreement, as 
set forth in Section 2.2.9 of the Additional Building Block. The Seller is liable for any 
repurchase. However, there can be no assurance that the Seller will have the financial 
resources to honour such obligations.  
Furthermore, the Seller has undertaken to notify the Fund upon becoming aware of a material 
breach of any representation and warranty in relation to the Receivables. The Seller is not 
obliged to monitor compliance of the Receivables with the representations and warranties 
following the relevant Purchase Date.  
 
 


 
 
 
16 
1.7. 
Limited protection 
An investment in the Notes of any Notes Series may be affected, inter alia, by a deterioration 
of the general economic conditions that have a negative effect on the payments of the 
Receivables that back the issue of the Notes of any Notes Series by the Fund. In the event that 
non-payments reach an elevated level, they could reduce, or even eliminate, the protection 
against losses in the Receivables portfolio which the Notes of any Notes Series benefit from 
as a result of the credit enhancements described under section 3.4.3 of the Additional 
Building Block. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing considerations, the risk of the Noteholders is mitigated by the 
different Priorities of Payments described in section 3.4.7.2 of the Additional Building Block. 
1.8. 
Purchase of Receivables 
There is no assurance that in the future the origination or the current level of origination of 
new Receivables satisfying the Eligibility Criteria set out in section 2.2.8.2 of the Additional 
Building Block (the Eligible Receivables) (transferred by the Seller to the Fund in the 
context of Initial Transfers) or new Receivables deriving from additional Drawings 
(transferred in the context of Additional Transfers) will be maintained and that, consequently, 
during the Programme Revolving Period (only), the Fund’s securitised portfolio will be 
replenished at its required level to prevent the occurrence of a Revolving Termination Event 
(as defined in section 3.1.3 of the Additional Building Block) which will early terminate the 
Programme Revolving Period and will start the Programme Amortisation Period. Once the 
Programme Amortisation Period has started, the Seller shall transfer Eligible Receivables in 
the context of Additional Transfers and may still be entitled to transfer Eligible Receivables 
in the context of Initial Transfers but with no guarantee to prevent a breach of the Minimum 
Portfolio Amount. 
Failure by the Seller to transfer Eligible Receivables to the Fund for an amount at least equal 
to the Minimum Purchase Amount on each Purchase Date during the Programme Revolving 
Period and the Programme Amortisation Period shall neither constitute a Seller Event of 
Default during the Programme Revolving Period or the Programme Amortisation Period, nor 
necessarily cause the occurrence of the Revolving Termination Event during the Programme 
Revolving Period.  
In any case, it should be noted that the fact that for the 6th consecutive Payment Dates the 
Unapplied Revolving Amount standing at the Treasury Account exceeds 15 per cent. (15%) 
of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of all Note Series on such date (a Purchase 
Shortfall) would cause a Revolving Termination Event. 
It should be noted that the Fund shall not purchase from the Seller Eligible Receivables in the 
context of Initial Transfers and/or Additional Transfers if any of the Conditions Precedent to 
the Purchase of Receivables set out in section 3.3.1.2 of the Additional Building Block are not 
satisfied.  
 


 
 
 
17 
1.9. 
Changes in the Portfolio 
The characteristics of the portfolio of outstanding Purchased Receivables will change from 
time to time with (i) the additional purchases of Receivables in the context of Initial Transfers 
and/or Additional Transfers by the Fund during the Programme Revolving Period, the 
Programme Amortisation Period and the Programme Accelerated Amortisation Period and (ii) 
the repayment or prepayment, as the case may be, of the Receivables. 
The Eligibility Criteria described in section 2.2.8.2 of the Additional Building Block aim at 
limiting the changes of the overall characteristics the Purchased Receivables. 
1.10. 
No assurance of insurance protection 
The Credit Card Agreements offer the Borrower the option of taking out insurance to cover 
the risk of the Borrower's death, temporary or permanent incapacity, unemployment or 
hospitalisation. The Aggregate Outstanding Debt of the insured Credit Cards was EUR 
113,406,613.75 as of 16 June 2017, representing 18.72% of the Aggregate Outstanding Debt. 
In all such Credit Card Agreements, the Seller was designated as beneficiary of the insurance 
payment and therefore, these payments (the Insurance Indemnification) would form part of 
the rights conferred upon the Fund, as established in section 3.3.3 of the Additional Building 
Block. 
1.11. 
Projections, Forecasts and Estimates. Forward-looking statements 
Certain matters contained in this Base Prospectus are forward-looking statements. Such 
statements appear in a number of places in this Base Prospectus, including with respect to 
assumptions on prepayment and certain other characteristics of the Receivables and reflect 
significant assumptions and subjective judgments by the Management Company that may or 
may not prove to be correct. Consequently, future results may differ from the Fund's 
expectations due to a variety of factors, including (but not limited to) the economic 
environment and changes in governmental regulations, fiscal policy, planning or tax laws in 
Spain or elsewhere. Moreover, past financial performance should not be considered a reliable 
indicator of future performance and prospective purchasers of any Class A Note and/or any 
Class B Notes of any Note Series and/or any Class C Notes of any Note Series are cautioned 
that any such statements are not guarantees of performance and involve risks and 
uncertainties, many of which are beyond the control of the Management Company. Neither 
the Arrangers, the Director nor any global coordinator, lead manager (including the Joint 
Lead Managers), bookrunner or underwriter has attempted or will attempt to verify any such 
statements, and do not make any representation, express or implied, with respect thereto. 
More generally, when issued in this Base Prospectus, the words “expect(s)”, “intend(s)”, 
“will” “may”, “anticipate(s)” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking 
statements. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which could cause 
actual results to differ materially from those projected. 
In addition, any projections, forecasts and estimates contained herein are forward-looking 
statements and are necessarily speculative in nature. It can be expected that some or all of the 


 
 
 
18 
assumptions underlying such projections will not materialise or will vary significantly from 
actual results. The historical performance of similar obligations is not necessarily indicative 
of its future performance. 
The financial and other information set out in this Base Prospectus, represents the historical 
experience of the Seller. None of the Arrangers, the Director , any global coordinator, lead 
manager (including the Joint Lead Managers), bookrunner or underwriter, the Management 
Company, the Paying Agent, the Issuer Accounts Bank or any of the Eligible Hedging 
Counterparties has undertaken or will undertake any investigation or review of, or search to 
verify the historical information. 
There is no assurance that the future experience and performance of the Purchased 
Receivables, the Fund or the Servicer will be similar to the historical experience described in 
this Base Prospectus. 
2. RISKS DERIVED FROM THE NOTES 
2.1. 
Subordination of the Class B Notes and the Class C Notes 
Credit enhancement for the Class A Notes of each Notes Series will be provided by the 
subordination of payments on the Class B Notes and the Class C Notes of the corresponding 
Notes Series during the Programme Revolving Period and the Programme Amortisation 
Period, and, by the subordination of payments on the Class B Notes and the Class C Notes of 
all Notes Series during the Programme Accelerated Amortisation Period. 
In addition, credit enhancement for the Class B Notes of each Notes Series will be provided 
by the subordination of payments on the Class C Notes of the corresponding Notes Series 
during the Programme Revolving Period and the Programme Amortisation Period, and, by the 
subordination of payments on the Class C Notes of all Notes Series during the Programme 
Accelerated Amortisation Period. 
Nevertheless there is no certainty that these subordination rules shall protect any class of 
Noteholders from the risk of loss. 
According to section 3.1.3 of the Additional Building Block, only the non-payment of the 
interest due and payable of the then most senior class of Notes between the Class A Notes and 
the Class B Notes shall be considered an Accelerated Amortisation Event. 
2.2. 
Relationship between Class A, Class B and Class C Notes and the Seller Interest Credit 
Facility  
During the Programme Revolving Period (i) the payments of interest under the Seller Interest 
Credit Facility will be paid on the same rank with the payments of interest under the then 
most senior Class of Notes of all outstanding Note Series (whether it be Class A Notes, Class 
B Notes or Class C Notes) and (ii) the payments of principal under the Seller Interest Credit 
Facility will be paid on the same rank with the payments of principal under the then most 
senior Class of Notes of all outstanding Note Series (whether it be Class A Notes, Class B 


 
 
 
19 
Notes or Class C Notes) (provided that the Residual Principal Deficiency Ledger is not in 
debit on the preceding Calculation Date). 
During the Programme Amortisation Period and the Programme Accelerated Amortisation 
Period (i) the payments of interest on the Seller Interest Credit Facility are subordinated to the 
payments of interest of the Notes of any Note Series and (ii) the payments of principal under 
the Seller Interest Credit Facility will be subordinated to the full redemption of the Class A 
Notes, the Class B Notes and the Class C Notes of all Note Series. 
2.3. 
Default interest 
In the event that on a Payment Date the Available Distribution Amounts, after going through 
the Interest Shortfall Priority of Payments, are not sufficient to meet in full interest amount due 
under the Notes, the unpaid amount of interest will be postponed.  
The postponed interest will neither accrue default interest nor imply capitalisation of the debt.  
For these purposes, Payment Date means the day falling on the 26th in each month of each 
year (subject to the Modified Following Business Day Convention). 
Interest Shortfall Priority of Payments has the meaning set out in section 3.4.7.2 of the 
Additional Building Block.  
2.4. 
Yield to Maturity of the Notes of any Note Series and the weighted average life of the 
Notes of each Note Series 
The yields to maturity on the Note Series will be sensitive to and affected by the amount and 
timing of delinquencies, prepayment and payment pattern, revolving and credit card usage, 
dilution and default on the Purchased Receivables, the level of the relevant interest reference 
rate with respect to the Notes, the occurrence of any Revolving Termination Events or any 
Accelerated Amortisation Events (as these terms are defined in section 3.1.3 of the Additional 
Building Block), the issuance of a new Note Series, the redemption of a Note Series, the 
occurrence of an Optional Early Redemption Event (as defined in section 4.8.of the Securities 
Note), the exercise by the Seller of the optional repurchase of Purchased Receivables and the 
early liquidation of the Fund. Each of such events may impact the respective weighted 
average lives and the yield to maturity of the Notes of any Note Series.  
The weighted average interest rate of the Credit Card Agreements may decrease from time to 
time due to various economic, financial or commercial events. 
The weighted average life of the Notes of any Note Series and the relevant assumptions shall 
be specified (i) with respect to the Notes of the Note Series to be issued on the Fund 
Incorporation Date, in the relevant Issuing Document and (ii) with respect to the Notes of any 
Note Series to be issued on any Issue Date (other than the Fund Incorporation Date), in the 
relevant Issuing Document. 
 


 
 
 
20 
2.5. 
Rating of the Rated Notes 
The credit risk of the Notes of any Notes Series (the Rated Notes) may be assessed by the 
Rating Agencies specified in the applicable Issuing Document of each Note Series (the 
Relevant Rating Agencies) as referred to in section 7.5 of the Securities Note.  
The Class A Notes and the Class B Notes (if any) of any Note Series shall always be Rated 
Notes. It is not obligatory that the Class C Notes are Rated Notes. That said, if the Class C 
Notes of any Note Series are Rated Notes, the Class C Notes of such Note Series shall be 
rated at least by one of the Relevant Rating Agencies. 
The meaning of the ratings assigned to the Rated Notes can be consulted in the web pages of 
the Relevant Rating Agencies. 
The Relevant Rating Agencies may not confirm any of the preliminary ratings initially 
assigned to the Rated Notes (or even withdraw such preliminary ratings) before or during the 
Subscription Date. In such event, the issue of such Note Series will be terminated by the 
Management Company (as described in section 2.6 below). 
In addition, the Relevant Rating Agencies may revise, suspend or withdraw the final rating 
assigned to the Rated Notes in each class at any time, based on any information that may 
come to their attention and/or changes in rating methodologies and practices. 
Therefore, these ratings are not and cannot therefore be construed as an invitation, 
recommendation or encouragement for investors to proceed to carry out any transaction 
whatsoever on the Rated Notes and, in particular, acquire, keep, charge or sell those Rated 
Notes. 
In general, European regulated investors are restricted under Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 
of the European Parliament and the Council of 16 September 2009 on credit rating agencies 
(Regulation 1060/2009) from using credit ratings for regulatory purposes, unless such ratings 
are issued by a credit rating agency established in the EU and registered under Regulation 
1060/2009 (and such registration has not been withdrawn or suspended). The list of registered 
and certified rating agencies published by the European Securities and Markets Authority 
(ESMA) on its website in accordance with Regulation 1060/2009 is not conclusive evidence 
of the status of the relevant rating agency included in such list, as there might be delays 
between certain supervisory measures being taken against a relevant rating agency and the 
publication of the updated ESMA list. Certain information with respect to the credit rating 
agencies and ratings is set out in this Base Prospectus. 
In addition to the abovementioned, there could be unsolicited ratings published in respect of 
the Rated Notes. If such unsolicited ratings are lower than the comparable rating assigned to 
the Rated Notes by the Relevant Rating Agencies, those unsolicited ratings could have an 
adverse effect on the value of the Rated Notes. 
 


 
 
 
21 
2.6. 
Risk linked to the early termination of a Notes Series issue and the early liquidation of 
the Fund  
2.6.1. 
Early termination of a Notes Series issue 
An issue of a Notes Series will be terminated by the Management Company if: 
 
any of the preliminary ratings initially assigned to the Rated Notes by the 
(a)
Relevant Rating Agencies have not been confirmed (or if such ratings are 
withdrawn) before or during the Subscription Date; or  
 
an event occurs that could not be foreseen or, even if foreseen, is inevitable 
(b)
rendering it impossible to perform the subscription or disbursement of the Notes 
of such Notes Series pursuant to article 1,105 of the Civil Code (force majeure); 
or  
 
the conditions precedent to the relevant Notes Subscription Agreement as 
(c)
described in the Subscription Agreement are not met before the beginning of the 
Subscription Period; or 
 
an Insolvency Event has occurred with respect to the Seller before the 
(d)
disbursement of the relevant Notes on the Disbursement Date; or 
 
the General Reserve is not funded up to the General Reserve Required Amount 
(e)
specified in the relevant Issuing Document, (i) with respect to the first Note 
Series issued on the Fund Incorporation Date, before the disbursement of the 
Notes on the Disbursement Date, (ii) with respect to the subsequent Note Series 
issued by the Fund, on the Issue Date; or 
 
the Commingling Reserve is not funded up to the Commingling Reserve 
(f)
Required Amount specified in the relevant Issuing Document, (i) with respect to 
the first Note Series issued on the Fund Incorporation Date, before the 
disbursement of the Notes on the Disbursement Date, (ii) with respect to the 
subsequent Note Series issued by the Fund, on the Issue Date; or 
 
the Seller (as Expenses Subordinated Facility Provider) has not made available to 
(g)
the Fund under the Expenses Subordinated Facility an amount equal to (i) with 
respect to the first Note Series issued on the Fund Incorporation date, the Initial 
Expenses and the Note Series Issue Expenses before the disbursement of the 
Notes on the Disbursement Date and (ii) with respect to any other Note Series, 
the Note Series Issue Expenses on or prior the relevant Issue Date of such Note 
Series.  
The early termination of the issue of a Note Series (other than as described below with respect 
to the issue of the Note Series to be made on the Fund Incorporation Date) shall not constitute 
a Fund Liquidation Event nor imply the extinguishment of the Fund in any manner 


 
 
 
22 
whatsoever and shall not affect nor cause the termination of any of the Note Series previously 
issued by the Fund.  
If the Note Series to be issued on the Fund Incorporation Date is early terminated in 
accordance with section 4.4.7.1 of the Registration Document for any reason (other than the 
occurrence of the event foreseen in paragraph (d) of such section 4.4.7.1), the Purchase Price 
of the initial portfolio of Eligible Receivables shall be funded with a drawing under the Seller 
Interest Credit Facility. 
2.6.2. 
Early liquidation of the Fund 
If the Note Series to be issued on the Fund Incorporation Date is early terminated in 
accordance with section 4.4.7.2 of the Registration Document upon the occurrence of an 
Insolvency Event with respect to the Seller before the disbursement of the relevant Notes on 
the Disbursement Date, the Fund will be terminated by the Management Company. 
In the event foreseen in the preceding paragraph, the transfer of the Receivables to the Fund 
made under the Deed of Incorporation, the issue of the Notes Series issued on the Fund 
Incorporation Date, as well as the rest of agreements of the Fund will be terminated and the 
Fund will be extinguished. The Seller shall pay all the Initial Expenses and the Note Series 
Issue Expenses incurred as a result of the incorporation of the Fund and the issue of the Notes 
Series issued on the Fund Incorporation Date. 
2.7. 
The Servicer 
Without prejudice that the obligations to manage and service the Receivables correspond 
initially to the Management Company as master servicer of the Purchased Receivables (in 
such condition, the Master Servicer) in accordance with article 26.1 b) of Law 5/2015, of 27 
April, on the Business Financing Promotion (Ley 5/2015, de 27 de abril, de Fomento de la 
Financiación Empresarial) (Law 5/2015), the custody and servicing of the Receivables will 
be carried out by WIZINK (in such condition, the Servicer) as services provider without such 
appointment implying a limitation of the liability of the Management vis-à-vis the noteholders 
and any funder of the Fund, in accordance with the terms described in section 3.7.2 of the 
Additional Building Block and in the Deed of Incorporation.  
If a Servicer Termination Event occurs (as this is defined in section 3.7.2.14 of the Additional 
Building Block), then the Fund will be entitled to terminate the appointment of the Servicer 
and the Management Company, acting in the name and on behalf of the Fund as Master 
Servicer and as back-up servicer facilitator in accordance with section 3.7.2.14 of the 
Additional Building Block, shall use its reasonable endeavours to find, select and appoint a 
new servicer (also as services provider) in its place.  
Any change in the Servicer could delay collection of payments on the Receivables and 
ultimately could adversely affect the ability of the Fund to make payments in full on the 
Notes.  


 
 
 
23 
If a Servicer Termination Event occurs, there can be no assurance that a replacement servicer 
with sufficient experience in servicing the Receivables would be found who would be willing 
and able to service the Receivables on the terms, or substantially similar terms, set out in 
section 3.7.2.1 of the Additional Building Block. No assurance can be given that such 
replacement servicer will not charge fees in excess of the fees to be paid to the Servicer.  
Furthermore, it may be that the terms on which a replacement servicer may be appointed are 
substantially different from those set out in section 3.7.2.1 of the Additional Building Block 
and the terms may be such that the Noteholders may be adversely affected. The ability of a 
replacement servicer to fully perform the required services would depend, among other 
things, on the information, software and records available at the time of the appointment. 
Transition from a servicer to a replacement servicer may result in delays in the performance 
of servicing functions. Any delay or inability to appoint a replacement servicer may affect 
payments on the Receivables and hence the Fund's ability to make payments when due on the 
Notes. 
The Noteholders have no right to give orders or directions to the Management Company in 
relation to the duties and/or appointment or removal of the Servicer. Such rights are vested 
solely in the Management Company. 
In addition, Noteholders should be aware that the Servicer has no obligation itself to advance 
payments that Borrowers fail to make in a timely fashion. 
2.8. 
Liquidity  
Class A Notes, Class B Notes and Class C Notes of any Notes Series may be unlisted or listed 
on the AIAF Fixed Income Market (AIAF). There is no guarantee that a minimum volume or 
frequency of Notes transactions will be forthcoming in the market. There is no entity required 
to intervene in the secondary market, providing liquidity to the Notes by offering itself as 
counterparty. In particular, neither the Director, the Arrangers nor any global coordinator, lead 
manager (including the Joint Lead Managers), bookrunner or underwriter nor any of their 
affiliates are obliged to intervene in the secondary market, providing liquidity to the Notes. 
A prolonged reduction in demand for asset-backed or other debt securities, alone or in 
combination with the continuing increase in prevailing market interest rates, may adversely 
affect the market value of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes or the Class C Notes, the 
ability of the Noteholders to sell the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes or the Class C Notes or 
acquire credit protection on the Notes and may cause significant fluctuations in the market 
value of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes or the Class C Notes. Any of the above may 
result in significant losses to the Noteholders. 
Furthermore, outside the optional redemption as set forth in section 4.8. of the Securities Note 
and in the case of Early Liquidation of the Fund upon the terms set forth in section 4.4.3 of the 
Registration Document, the Fund may not early redeem the Notes. 
 


 
 
 
24 
2.9. 
Issue of further Notes Series 
In accordance with the open nature of the Fund, the Fund may from time to time during the 
Programme Revolving Period issue further Notes Series without notice to existing 
Noteholders and without their consent and which may have different term from outstanding 
notes. Each issue of further Notes Series will be subject to the fulfilment of the Further Note 
Series Issuance Conditions Precedent set out in section 4.12.3 of the Securities Note have 
been satisfied.  
The issuance of new Note Series could adversely affect the timing and amount of payments 
on outstanding Notes of any Note Series. For example, some Note Series issued after any 
existing Note Series may have a higher interest rate than the existing Note Series. This could 
result in a reduction in the amounts available pay interest on any existing Note Series. 
If further Note Series are issued, the Available Amortisation Amount would be shared 
amongst all outstanding Notes with potential effects on the amounts payable towards the 
redemption of each outstanding Class A Note, each outstanding Class B Note and each 
outstanding Class C Note of any Note Series and making the rate at which they amortise 
slower than would otherwise be the case.  
In order to mitigate this risk it should be noted that: 
 
the Scheduled Amortisation Starting Date of any new Note Series shall only fall after 
(a)
the Scheduled Amortisation Starting Date of any previously issued Note Series which 
remains outstanding on the Issue Date of such new Note Series; and 
 
a fixed ratio of allocation of principal (i.e. the Note Series 20xx-yy Principal Ratio) 
(b)
between the outstanding Note Series which enable a faster amortisation of any Note 
Series compared to a pro rata allocation and to preserve the economic interests of 
previously issued Note Series has been set up (subject to an automatic reset in case of 
further issue of a Note Series or a full redemption). 
2.10. 
Prepayments or payment rate 
Faster than expected rates of prepayments or principal payment rate on the Receivables will 
cause the Fund to make payments of principal on the Notes earlier than expected and will 
shorten the maturity of the Notes of any Note Series. Prepayments or higher payment rate on 
the Receivables may occur as a result of (i) prepayments of Receivables by Borrowers in 
whole or in part; (ii) increase of the instalments by the Borrowers above the minimum 
contractual instalments; (iii) liquidations and other recoveries due to default and (iv) 
repurchases by the Seller of any Receivables. A wide variety of economic, social and other 
factors will influence the rate of prepayments on the Receivables. No prediction can be made 
as to the actual prepayment rates that will be experienced on the Receivables. 
If principal is paid on the Notes of any Notes Series earlier than expected due to prepayments 
on the Receivables (such prepayments occurring at a time when interest rates are lower than 
interest rates that would otherwise be applied if such prepayments have not been made or 


 
 
 
25 
made at a different time), Noteholders may not be able to reinvest the principal in a 
comparable security with an effective interest rate equivalent to the interest rate on the Notes 
of any Note Series. Similarly, if principal payments on the Notes of any Note Series are made 
later than expected due to slower than expected prepayments or payments on the Receivables, 
Noteholders may lose reinvestment opportunities. Noteholders will bear all reinvestment risk 
resulting from receiving payments of principal on the Notes of any Note Series earlier or later 
than expected. 
2.11. 
Early redemption of the Notes 
In accordance with section 4.8 of the Securities Note, subject to certain conditions, the Seller 
may be entitled to instruct the Management Company to exercise on behalf of the Fund (i) the 
optional redemption of the relevant Note Series on the applicable Note Series 20xx-yy Clean-
Up Call Date or (ii) the optional redemption of the relevant Note Series on the Note Series 
20xx-yy Call Date specified in the applicable Issuing Document.  
For these purposes as described in section 4.8.5 Optional Early Redemption of the Securities 
Note: 
Note Series 20xx-yy Clean-Up Call Date means, in respect of any Note Series 20xx-yy, the 
Payment Date on which the Note Series 20xx-yy Clean-Up Call Condition is satisfied and any 
subsequent Payment Date. 
Note Series 20xx-yy Call Date means, with respect to the Note Series 20xx-yy, any call date 
(which is a Payment Date) specified in the applicable Issuing Document. Any Note Series 
may have one or several Note Series 20xx-yy Call Date(s) which can be successive or not. 
If a Notes Series is redeemed earlier than expected due to the exercise by the Fund 
(following instructions of the Seller) of the early redemption of such Note Series, 
Noteholders may not be able to reinvest the principal in a comparable security with an 
effective interest rate equivalent to the interest rate on the Notes of any Note Series. 
Noteholders will bear all reinvestment risk resulting from early redemption of the Notes of 
any Note Series earlier than expected. 
2.12. 
General Investment Considerations 
The Notes Series are addressed solely to qualified investors as defined in article 39 of Royal 
Decree 1310/2005, of 4 November, partly developing the Law 24/1988, of 28 July, on the 
Spanish Securities Market Law in regard to admission to trading of securities in official 
secondary markets, public offerings for sale or subscription and the Base Prospectus required 
for that purpose (the Royal Decree 1310/2005). 
The Notes of any Notes Series are limited recourse instruments and there can be no assurance 
that the Noteholders will receive the full amounts payable at any time by the Fund under the 
Notes or that they will receive any return on their investment in the Notes. Prospective 
investors are therefore advised to review this Base Prospectus, any supplement to the Base 
Prospectus prepared by the Management Company in accordance with article 22 of Royal 


 
 
 
26 
Decree 1310/2005 (each, a Prospectus Supplement) and the Issuing Document of each Note 
Series carefully and consider, among other things, the risk factors set out in this section before 
deciding whether to invest in the Notes of any Notes Series.  
Prospective investors should also ensure they understand the nature of the Notes and the 
extent of their exposure to risk when they consider the suitability of investing in such Notes in 
light of their own circumstances and financial conditions. The Arrangers, the Director and any 
global coordinator, lead manager (including the Joint Lead Managers), bookrunner or 
underwriter have not undertaken to review the financial condition or affairs of the Seller or 
the Fund during the life of the arrangements contemplated by this Base Prospectus, or to 
advise any investor or potential investor in the Notes or any information that is not included 
in this Base Prospectus that comes to the attention of the Arrangers, the Director and any 
global coordinator, lead manager (including the Joint Lead Managers), bookrunner or 
underwriter. 
2.13. 
Certain material interests and potential for conflicts 
Certain parties to the transaction have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, 
investment banking and/or commercial banking or other services for the Fund (including the 
placement and underwriting of the Notes of any Notes Series), the Seller or its affiliates and 
the Management Company in the ordinary course of business. Other parties to the transaction 
may also perform multiple roles. Accordingly, conflicts of interest may exist or may arise as a 
result of parties having previously engaged or in the future engaging in transactions with 
other parties, having multiple roles or carrying out other transactions for third parties. The 
parties to the transaction may be replaced by one or more new parties. It cannot be excluded 
that such a new party could also have a potential conflicting interest, which might ultimately 
have a negative impact on the ability of the Fund to perform its obligations in respect of the 
Notes. 
Accordingly, conflicts of interest may exist or may arise as a result of parties to this 
transaction: (a) having previously engaged or in the future engaging in transactions with other 
parties to the transaction; (b) having multiple roles in this transaction; and/or (c) carrying out 
other roles or transactions for third parties. 
Currently, there is no knowledge of the existence of any conflict of interests between the 
parties involved in the transaction. 
2.14. 
Change of counterparties 
The parties to the Programme Documents who receive and hold monies or provide support to 
the transaction pursuant to the terms of such documents are required to satisfy certain criteria 
to continue to be counterparty to the Fund.  
These criteria include requirements in relation to the short-term and long-term unguaranteed 
and unsecured ratings ascribed to such party by the Relevant Rating Agencies. If the party 
concerned ceases to satisfy the applicable criteria, then the rights and obligations of that party 
(including the right or obligation to receive monies on behalf of the Fund) may be required to 


 
 
 
27 
be transferred to another entity which does satisfy the applicable ratings criteria. In these 
circumstances, the terms agreed with the replacement entity may not be as favourable as those 
agreed with the original party and the cost to the Fund may therefore increase. In addition, it 
may not be possible to find an entity with the required ratings that would be willing to act in 
such role. This may reduce amounts available to the Fund to make payments of interest and 
principal on the Notes and/or lead to a downgrade in the ratings of the Rated Notes. 
In addition, should the applicable criteria cease to be satisfied, then the parties to the relevant 
Programme Document may agree to amend or waive certain of the terms of such document, 
including the applicable criteria (although this will not apply to mandatory provisions of law), 
in order to avoid the need for a replacement entity to be appointed. The consent of 
Noteholders may not be required in relation to such amendments and/or waivers. 
3. RISKS DERIVING FROM THE LEGAL STATUS AND BUSINESS OF THE FUND 
3.1. 
Nature of the Fund and obligations of the Management Company 
The Fund is an isolated pool of assets with no legal personality open both on the assets and 
liability side such that is entitled to acquire additional Receivables and issue successive Notes 
Series during the life of the Fund. All the Receivables pooled in the Fund from time to time 
will serve to secure the payment of all the obligations derived from all the Notes under all 
Notes Series issued by the Fund and constitute its liabilities at that time.  
Pursuant to Law 5/2015 the Fund is managed by a Management Company duly licensed for 
such purposes. The Fund’s liability for its obligations vis-à-vis its creditors (including the 
holders of the Notes) shall be limited in recourse to its assets and payments are subject to the 
applicable Priority of Payments, and none of the Management Company, the Arrangers, the 
Director, any global coordinator, lead manager (including the Joint Lead Managers), 
bookrunner or underwriter, the Eligible Hedging Counterparties or any of the other 
transaction parties shall be responsible for any of the Fund’s liabilities. 
The Management Company will perform for the Fund those duties attributed to it in Law 
5/2015, as well as safeguarding the best interest of the holders of the Notes and generally the 
creditors of the Fund. The Noteholders will not be entitled to give directions or instructions to 
the Management Company in relation to the exercise of their respective rights.  
The Noteholders and the other ordinary creditors of the Fund shall not have any right of 
action either against the Fund or against the Management Company other than that deriving 
from non-performance of their respective duties or non-compliance with the provisions of 
the Deed of Incorporation, this Base Prospectus or the applicable laws and regulations. Any 
such actions will need to be resolved in the (corresponding) judicial proceedings.  
Hence, the Noteholders will have no recourse to the Fund or the Management Company based 
only on delinquency or payment default of the Receivables or breach of agreement by third 
parties.  


 
 
 
28 
3.2. 
Certain features of the Fund and the Programme have been created in the interest of 
the Seller  
Pursuant to the Deed of Incorporation and as described in the Base Prospectus, the Fund and 
the Programme have certain features that have been designed in the interest of the Seller. 
In this regard, amongst others, the Seller is entitled to: 
 
direct the Management Company to carry out an issue by the Fund of a new Note 
(a)
Series; 
 
direct the Management Company to liquidate the Fund where (i) the aggregate 
(b)
Principal Amount Outstanding of all outstanding Notes is equal or less than 10% of 
the aggregate Initial Principal Amount thereof or (ii) the Notes issued by the Fund are 
held solely by the Seller or there are no Notes outstanding and the Seller requests the 
liquidation of the Fund, in accordance with section 4.4.3 of the Registration 
Document; 
 
subject to certain conditions, send a Seller's Optional Early Redemption Written 
(c)
Instruction in order for the Management Company to exercise on behalf of the Fund 
(i) the optional redemption of the relevant Note Series on the applicable Note Series 
20xx-yy Clean-Up Call Date or (ii) the optional redemption of the relevant Note 
Series on the Note Series 20xx-yy Call Date specified in the applicable Issuing 
Document, in accordance with section 4.8. of the Securities Note; 
 
repurchase certain Purchased Receivables from the Fund (including Purchased 
(d)
Receivables arising from Performing Credit Cards), in accordance with section 
3.3.1.12 of the Additional Building Block; 
 
reserve the right to subscribe for all or part of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes or 
(e)
the Class C Notes of a given Note Series. In case where the Seller subscribe all the 
Class A Notes, Class B Notes or the Class C Notes of such Note Series, such Notes 
shall not be placed with any investor, in accordance with section 4.12.6 of the 
Securities Note. 
The interests of the Seller may not be at all times aligned with those of the rest of the holders 
of the Notes and, therefore, this circumstance should be taken into consideration by the 
investor when acquiring the Notes. 
3.3. 
Mandatory replacement of the Management Company 
In accordance with article 33 of Law 5/2015, if the Management Company is subject to 
an insolvency proceeding (concurso), without prejudice to the effects of such insolvency 
proceeding (as described below), it shall find another management company to replace it. 
Similarly, in case that its authorisation to act as management company of securitisation funds 
were revoked, a new management company replacing it would need to be found. If four (4) 
months have elapsed since the occurrence of the event requiring the replacement and a new 


 
 
 
29 
management company that is prepared to take over the management of the Fund has not been 
found, a trigger event for the Early Liquidation of the Fund will occur and the Notes, and (i) 
the Expenses Subordinated Facility, (ii) the General Reserve Subordinated Facility, (iii) the 
Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility and (iv) the Seller Interest Credit Facility (as 
these terms are defined in sections 3.4.4.1, 3.4.3.7, 3.4.3.8. and 3.4.4.4 respectively) (the 
Subordinated Facilities) will be redeemed or repaid, as the case may be, in accordance with 
the provisions of the Deed of Incorporation and this Base Prospectus in particular in 
accordance with the Accelerated Priority of Payments set out in section 3.4.7.2 of the 
Additional Building Block.  
3.4. 
Insolvency  
The insolvency proceeding (concurso) of any of the parties involved (whether it be the Seller, 
the Management Company, the Issuer Accounts Bank, the Servicer or any other counterparty 
of the Fund) could affect their contractual relations with the Fund as provided in Law 22/2003, 
of 9 July, on Insolvency (Ley 22/2003, de 9 de julio, Ley Concursal) (the Insolvency Law) and 
consequently the ability of the Fund to meets its obligations under the Notes. 
Pursuant to the provisions of the Second Additional Provision of the Insolvency Law, the 
insolvency provisions of Law 5/2015 will apply.  
In the event of the insolvency of the Seller, and in accordance with article 16 of Law 5/2015 
(by reference to article 15 of Law 2/1981), the transfer of the Receivables to the Fund may 
only be rescinded or challenged under article 71 of the Insolvency Law by the insolvency 
administration (administración concursal) and in so challenging, the insolvency 
administration will have to prove the existence of fraud in the transfer.  
Furthermore, all Fund’s assets held by the Seller, except for cash, due to the fungible nature 
thereof, will become the property of the Fund and must be made available under the terms of 
articles 80 and 81 of the Insolvency Law. 
According to the interpretation of a majority of legal scholars regarding articles 80 and 81 of 
the Insolvency Law, if the Seller is declared insolvent, monies received and held thereby on 
behalf of the Fund in its capacity as counterparty to certain agreements executed before the 
date of declaration of insolvency may be affected by the results of the insolvency. 
If the Management Company is declared under an insolvency proceeding (concurso), it 
must be replaced by another management company in accordance with the provisions of 
section 3.3 above. In the event of the insolvency proceeding (concurso) of the Management 
Company, any assets of the Fund that are in the possession of the Management Company and 
in respect of which the Management Company has no right of use, surety or retention -
except for money due to its fungible nature- and that form part of the latter's assets will be 
construed as belonging to the Fund, and the insolvency officials (administración concursal) 
must deliver them to the Fund. 
In practice, due to the nature of the securitisation transaction in question, and except in the 
event of a breach by the parties, no cash amounts will become part of the assets of the 


 
 
 
30 
Management Company since the amounts that constitute the revenues of the Fund must be 
deposited, in accordance with the terms set forth in the Deed of Incorporation and this Base 
Prospectus, in the accounts opened on behalf of the Fund by the Management Company 
(which will be involved in opening such accounts not only as the agent of the Fund, but as its 
legal representative). Therefore the Fund will have full separation right over those assets from 
those of the Management Company, in the terms set forth in articles 80 and 81 of the 
Insolvency Law. 
Additionally, in the event that WIZINK, as Servicer and the entity that will collect the 
amounts paid deriving from the Receivables, is declared under an insolvency proceeding 
(concurso), the Fund, acting through its Management Company, will be entitled to receive 
from WIZINK the amounts derived from the Receivables from the date that it is declared 
insolvent, because such amounts will be construed as owned by the Fund, and therefore must 
be transferred to the Management Company on behalf of the Fund. However, as collections 
from the Borrowers are initially paid to an account opened in the Collections Account Bank, 
moneys may cease to be traceable due to their fungible nature during the period in which they 
are held by WIZINK as Servicer at the Collections Account Bank. For this period of time, the 
Noteholders will be exposed to the credit quality of the Collections Account Banks. In order 
to mitigate the commingling risk derived from a potential insolvency of the Servicer, 
WIZINK as Servicer has agreed to grant in rem rights of pledge over the Collections Account 
in favour of the Fund pursuant to the Collections Account Security Document.  
The mechanisms available for mitigating such risk are described in section 3.4.3 of the 
Additional Building Block.  
In addition, the Issuer Accounts Bank and the Collections Account Banks held by the Servicer 
are subject to Law 11/2015, of 18 June 2015, on the recovery and resolution of credit entities 
and investment firms (Ley 11/2015, de 18 de junio, de recuperación y resolución de entidades 
de crédito y empresas de servicios de inversion), which implements in Spain the Directive 
2014/59/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 establishing a 
framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment firms. 
Application of those provisions may delay or in certain cases impede the recovery of the 
amounts deposited in accounts opened in the Issuer Accounts Bank or the Collections 
Account Banks. 
The Fund, being incorporated as an isolated pool of assets with no legal personality pursuant 
to Law 5/2015 is not subject to insolvency proceedings under the Insolvency Law. 
3.5. 
Breach of agreements by third parties 
The Fund has entered into agreements with third parties for the provision of certain services 
in relation to the operation of the Fund and in relation to the Notes (as further described in the 
different sections of the Additional Building Block describing the Programme Documents). 
The Noteholders could be prejudiced if any of the referred counterparties fails to fulfil any of 
the obligations assumed under any of the aforementioned agreements. Nevertheless, certain 


 
 
 
31 
mechanisms are contemplated in the relevant agreements to mitigate such possible breaches. 
All the foregoing is without prejudice to the legal consequences of any breach by the 
corresponding counterparties of the applicable contractual provisions or derived from the 
Spanish legislation. 
3.6. 
Eurosystem eligibility 
The Class A Notes of any Notes Series may be held in a manner which will allow Eurosystem 
eligibility. Class A Notes of any Notes Series are intended upon issue to be deposited with 
Sociedad de Gestión de los Sistemas de Registro, Compensación y Liquidación de Valores 
(IBERCLEAR), but given that, amongst others, Class A Notes of a Note Series may be 
unlisted Notes or represented in physical titles, does not necessarily mean that all Class A 
Notes of any Notes Series will be recognised as eligible collateral for Eurosystem monetary 
policy and intra-day credit operations by the Eurosystem (Eurosystem Eligible Collateral) 
either upon issue or at any or all times during their life.  
Such recognition will, inter alia, depend upon satisfaction of the Eurosystem eligibility 
criteria set out in the Guideline of the European Central Bank (the ECB) of 19 December 
2014 on implementation of the Eurosystem monetary policy framework (ECB/2014/60) as 
amended and applicable from time to time (the Guideline). In addition, the Management 
Company (based on information supplied by the Servicer) will, for as long as the Class A 
Notes of any Notes Series are intended to be held in a manner which will allow Eurosystem 
eligibility, make loan-level data available in such manner as required by the ECB to comply 
with the Eurosystem eligibility criteria, subject to applicable data protection rules. 
None of the Fund, the Management Company, the Seller, the Eligible Hedging 
Counterparties, the Arrangers, the Director and any global coordinator, lead manager 
(including the Joint Lead Managers), bookrunner or underwriter gives or will give any 
representation, warranty, confirmation or guarantee to any investor in the Class A Notes that 
the Class A Notes will, either upon issue, or at any or at all times during their life, satisfy all 
or any requirements for Eurosystem eligibility and be recognised as Eurosystem Eligible 
Collateral for any reason whatsoever. Any potential investor in the Class A Notes of any 
Notes Series should extract its own conclusions and seek its own advice with respect to 
whether or not the Class A Notes constitute Eurosystem Eligible Collateral. 
It is expected that Class B Notes and Class C Notes will not qualify as Eurosystem eligible 
given that Class B Notes and Class C Notes are subordinated. 
3.7. 
U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance withholding may affect payments on the Notes  
Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) impose a 
new reporting regime and, potentially, a 30 per cent. withholding tax with respect to (i) 
certain payments from sources within the United States, (ii) “foreign pass through payments” 
made to certain non-U.S. financial institutions (for the purposes of this section any such non-
U.S. financial institution, an FFI) that do not comply with this new reporting regime, and (iii) 
payments to certain investors that do not provide identification information with respect to 


 
 
 
32 
interests issued by a participating FFI (for the purposes of this section collectively 
Withholdable Payments). 
Whilst the Notes are held within the clearing systems, in all but the most remote 
circumstances, it is not expected that FATCA will affect the amount of any payment received 
by the clearing systems. However, FATCA may affect payments made to custodians or 
intermediaries in the subsequent payment chain leading to the ultimate investor if any such 
custodian or intermediary generally is unable to receive payments free of FATCA 
withholding. It also may affect payment to any ultimate investor that is a financial institution 
that is not entitled to receive payments free of withholding under FATCA, or an ultimate 
investor that fails to provide its broker (or other custodian or intermediary from which it 
receives payment) with any information, forms, other documentation or consents that may be 
necessary for the payments to be made free of FATCA withholding. Investors should choose 
the custodians or intermediaries with care (to ensure each is compliant with FATCA or other 
laws or agreements related to FATCA) and provide each custodian or intermediary with any 
information, forms, other documentation or consents that may be necessary for such custodian 
or intermediary to make a payment free of FATCA withholding.  
The Fund's obligations under the Notes are discharged once it has paid the clearing systems, 
and the Fund has therefore no responsibility for any amount thereafter transmitted through the 
clearing systems and custodians or intermediaries. 
The United States and the Government of the Kingdom of Spain have entered into an 
intergovernmental agreement to facilitate the implementation of FATCA (for the purposes of 
this section, the IGA). An FFI (such as the Fund) that complies with the terms of the IGA, as 
well as applicable local law requirements will not be subject to withholding under FATCA 
with respect to Withholdable Payments that it receives. Further, an FFI that complies with the 
terms of the IGA will not be required to withhold under FATCA on payments it makes to 
Noteholders of such FFI (unless it has agreed to do so under the U.S. “qualified 
intermediary,” “withholding foreign partnership,” or “withholding foreign trust” regimes). 
Pursuant to the IGA, an FFI is required to report certain information in respect of certain of its 
Noteholders to its home government, whereupon such information will be provided to the 
U.S. Internal Revenue Service. The Fund will undertake to comply with the IGA and any 
local implementing legislation, but there is no assurance that it will be able to do so. 
An FFI that fails to comply with the terms of the IGA may become subject to the FATCA 
Withholding described above. Additionally, a failure to comply with future local 
implementing legislation may result in negative consequences to an FFI. The imposition of 
the FATCA withholding on payments made to the Fund would reduce the profitability, and 
thus the cash available to make payments on the Notes. Prospective investors should consult 
their advisers about the potential application of FATCA. 
3.8. 
Economic conditions in the Euro-zone 
Concerns relating to credit risks (including that of sovereigns and those of entities which are 
exposed to sovereigns) persist, in particular, with respect to current economic, monetary and 


 
 
 
33 
political conditions in the Euro-zone. If such concerns further deteriorate (including as may 
be demonstrated by any relevant credit rating agency action, any default or restructuring of 
indebtedness by one or more states or institutions and/or any changes to, including any break-
up of, the Euro-zone), then these matters may cause further severe stress in the financial 
system generally and/or may adversely affect one or more of the parties to the Programme 
Documents (including the Seller and/or the Servicer). 
For these purposes, Euro-Zone means the region comprised of member states of the 
European Union that adopt the single currency in accordance with the Treaty establishing the 
European Community (signed in Rome on 25 March 1957), as amended by the Treaty on 
European Union (signed in Maastricht on 7 February 1992). 
3.9. 
Volcker Rule. Status of the Fund 
Under Section 619 of the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 
and the corresponding implementing rules (the Volcker Rule), “banking entities” are 
prohibited from, engaging in proprietary trading or from acquiring or retaining any 
“ownership interest” in, or acting as “sponsor” of, or having certain relationships with, certain 
investment vehicles referred to in the Volcker Rule as “covered funds”, except as may be 
permitted by an applicable exclusion or exception from the Volcker Rule. In general, there is 
limited interpretive guidance regarding the Volcker Rule and the general effects of the 
Volcker Rule remain uncertain.  
At the time of constitution, the Fund is structured so as to not constitute a “covered fund” 
based on Section __.10(c)(8) of the Volcker Rule, commonly referred to as the Loan 
Securitization Exclusion. It is possible, however, that U.S. regulators could take a contrary 
position and determine that the Issuer should not be excluded from the definition of “covered 
fund” under the Volcker Rule. Any prospective investor in the Note Series, including a U.S. 
or foreign bank or a subsidiary or other affiliate thereof, should consult its own legal advisers 
regarding the impact of such a determination and other potential effects of the Volcker Rule. 
4. CERTAIN REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS 
4.1. 
Regulatory initiatives may have an adverse impact on the regulatory treatment of the 
Notes. No assurance is given that the transaction will comply with LCR or Solvency II 
requirements 
In Europe, the U.S. and elsewhere there is increased political and regulatory scrutiny of the 
asset-backed securities industry. This has resulted in a raft of measures for increased 
regulation which are currently at various stages of implementation and which may have an 
adverse impact on the regulatory position for certain investors in securitisation exposures 
and/or on the incentives for certain investors to hold asset-backed securities, and may thereby 
affect the liquidity of such securities. Investors in the Notes are responsible for analysing their 
own regulatory position and none of the Fund, the Management Company, the Eligible 
Hedging Counterparties, the Arrangers, , the Director, any global coordinator, lead manager 
(including the Joint Lead Managers), bookrunner or underwriter and any other party to the 


 
 
 
34 
Programme Documents makes any representation to any prospective investor or purchaser of 
the Notes regarding the regulatory treatment of their investment on the Disbursement Date or 
at any time in the future. 
In addition, investors should be aware of the EU risk retention and due diligence requirements 
which currently apply, or are expected to apply in the future, in respect of various types of EU 
regulated investors including credit institutions, authorised alternative investment fund 
managers, investment firms, insurance and reinsurance undertakings, UCITS funds and 
institutions for occupational retirement provision.  
The risk retention and due diligence requirements described above apply, or are expected to 
apply, in respect of the Notes, to the investors. With respect to the commitment of the Seller 
to retain a material net economic interest in the securitisation and with respect to the 
information to be made available by the Fund or another relevant party (or, after the 
Disbursement Date, by the Management Company on the Fund’s behalf), please see the 
statements set out in the section of this Base Prospectus headed “Certain Regulatory and 
Industry Disclosures”. Relevant investors are required to independently assess and determine 
the sufficiency of the information described above for the purposes of complying with any 
relevant requirements and none of the Fund, the Arrangers, the Director, any global 
coordinator, lead manager (including the Joint Lead Managers), bookrunner or underwriter, 
the Eligible Hedging Counterparties or any other party to the transaction makes any 
representation that the information described above is sufficient in all circumstances for such 
purposes. 
Prospective investors should therefore make themselves aware of the changes and 
requirements described above (and any corresponding implementing rules of their regulator), 
where applicable to them, in addition to any other applicable regulatory requirements with 
respect to their investment in the Notes. The matters described above and any other changes 
to the regulation or regulatory treatment of the Notes for some or all investors may negatively 
impact the regulatory position of individual investors and, in addition, have a negative impact 
on the price and liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market. 
None of the Management Company, the Arrangers, the Director, the any global coordinator, 
lead manager (including the Joint Lead Managers), bookrunner or underwriter, the Seller or 
the Servicer makes any representation to any prospective investor or purchaser of the Notes as 
to these matters on the date of this Base Prospectus or at any time in the future. 
4.2. 
Impact of financial transaction taxes 
On 14 February 2013, the European Commission published its proposal (for the purposes of 
this section, the Commission’s Proposal) for a Council Directive implementing enhanced 
cooperation in the area of a financial transaction tax (for the purposes of this section, FTT), to 
be adopted in certain participating EU member states (including Belgium, Germany, Estonia, 
Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia, although Estonia has 
since stated that it will not participate).  


 
 
 
35 
The proposed Directive aims to ensure that the financial sector makes a fair and substantial 
contribution to covering the costs of the financial crisis and creating a level playing field with 
other sectors from a taxation point of view. A joint statement issued in May 2014 by ten of 
the eleven participating Member States indicated an intention to implement the FTT 
progressively, such that it would initially apply to shares and certain derivatives from 1 
January 2016, although the FTT proposal has not yet been introduced and still remains subject 
to negotiation between those states and the scope of any such tax is uncertain. It may 
therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. 
Additional EU member states may decide to participate. 
Under the Commission’s Proposal (as defined above) the FTT could apply in certain 
circumstances to persons both within and outside of the participating Member States. 
Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the Notes where at least one party is a 
financial institution, and at least one party is established in a participating Member State. A 
financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, “established” in a participating Member 
State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established 
in a participating Member State or (b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the 
dealings is issued in a participating Member State. 
The FTT may give rise to tax liabilities for the Fund with respect to certain transactions 
(including concluding swap transactions and/or purchases or sales of securities (such as 
authorised investments)) if it is adopted based on the Commission’s Proposal. Any such tax 
liabilities may reduce amounts available to the Fund to meet its obligations under the Notes 
and may result in investors receiving less interest or principal than expected.  
It should also be noted that the FTT could be payable in relation to relevant transactions by 
investors in respect of the Notes (including secondary market transactions) if the conditions 
for a charge to arise are satisfied and the FTT is adopted based on the Commission’s 
Proposal. Primary market transactions referred to in article 5(c) of Regulation (EC) No 
1287/2006 are expected to be exempt. 
Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation 
to the FTT. 
4.3. 
No assurance is given that the transaction will be designated as a simple, transparent 
securitisation 
On 30 September 2015, the European Commission published legislative proposals for two 
new regulations related to securitisation. Amongst others, the proposals include provisions 
intended to implement the revised securitisation framework developed by BCBS (the CRR 
Amendment Regulation) and provisions intended to harmonise and replace the risk retention 
and due diligence requirements applicable to certain EU regulated investors (the STS 
Regulation). The STS label will allow in some cases a better treatment of the capital for those 
securitisation assigned as STS. 
 


 
 
 
36 
The STS Regulation also aims to create common foundation criteria for identifying “STS 
securitisations”. There are still material differences between the legislative proposals and the 
current requirements (including with respect to application of retention requirements and the 
originator entities eligible to retain the required interest). In addition, the compliance position 
under any adopted revised requirements of transactions entered into, and of activities 
undertaken by a party (including an investor), prior to adoption is uncertain. No assurance can 
be given that the transaction will be designated as an “STS securitisation” under the STS 
Regulation at any point in the future. 
Prospective investors should therefore make themselves aware of the changes and 
requirements described above (and any corresponding implementing rules). The matters 
described above and any other changes to the regulation or regulatory treatment of the Notes 
for some or all investors may negatively impact the regulatory position of individual investors 
and, in addition, have a negative impact on the price and liquidity of the Notes in the 
secondary market. 
4.4. 
Change of law 
The structure of the transaction described in this Base Prospectus and, inter alia, the issue of 
the Notes and the ratings which are to be assigned to the Rated Notes are based on the law 
and administrative practice in effect as at the date of this Base Prospectus as it affects the 
parties to the transaction and the Audited Portfolio and having regard to the expected tax 
treatment of all relevant entities under such law and practice. No assurance can be given as to 
the impact of any possible change to such law (including any change in regulation which may 
occur without a change in primary legislation), administrative practice or tax treatment after 
the date of this Base Prospectus nor can any assurance be given as to whether any such 
change would adversely affect the ability of the Fund to make payments under the Notes. 
In addition, it should be noted that regulatory requirements (including any applicable 
retention, due diligence or disclosure obligations) may be recast or amended and there can be 
no assurance that any such changes will not adversely affect the compliance position of a 
transaction described in this Base Prospectus or of any party under any applicable law or 
regulation. 
4.5. 
CRA3 
The Regulation (EU) No 462/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 May 
2013 amending the CRA Regulation (for the purposes of this section, CRA3) became 
effective on 20 June 2013. CRA3 provides for certain additional disclosure requirements 
which are applicable in relation to structured finance transactions. Such disclosures will need 
to be made via a website to be set up by ESMA.  
The precise scope and manner of such disclosure are subject to regulatory technical standards 
(for the purposes of this section, the CRA3 RTS) prepared by ESMA. On 30 September 
2014, the European Commission adopted three CRA3 RTS to implement provisions of the 
CRA3. The CRA3 RTS specify (i) the information that the issuer, originator and sponsor of a 


 
 
 
37 
structured finance instrument established in the European Union must jointly disclose on the 
ESMA website, (ii) the frequency with which this information is to be updated and (iii) the 
presentation of this information by means of standardised disclosure templates.  
Additionally, CRA3 has introduced a requirement that where an issuer or related third parties 
(which term includes sponsors and originators) intends to solicit a credit rating of a structured 
finance instrument it will appoint at least two credit rating agencies and should consider 
appointing at least one rating agency having not more than a 10 per cent. total market share 
(as measured in accordance with article 8d(3) of the CRA (as amended by CRA3 RTS)) (for 
the purposes of this section, a small CRA), provided that a small CRA is capable of rating the 
relevant issuance or entity. Where the issuer or a related third party does not appoint at least 
one credit rating agency with no more than 10% market share, this must be documented. In 
order to give effect to those provisions of article 8d of CRA3, ESMA is required to annually 
publish a list of registered CRAs, their total market share, and the types of credit rating they 
issue.  
Investors should consult their legal advisors as to the applicability of the CRA3 RTS and any 
consequences of non-compliance in respect of their investment in the Notes of any Note 
Series. 
4.6. 
European Market Infrastructure Regulation EU 648/2012 (EMIR) 
EMIR and the regulations made under it impose certain obligations on parties to OTC 
derivative contracts according to whether they are “financial counterparties” or “non-financial 
counterparties”. 
Financial counterparties (as defined in EMIR) will, depending on the identity of their 
counterparty, be subject to a general obligation (the “clearing obligation”) to clear all 
“eligible” OTC derivative contracts through a duly authorised or recognised central 
counterparty. They must also report the details of all derivative contracts to a trade repository 
(the “reporting obligation”) and in general undertake certain risk-mitigation techniques in 
respect of OTC derivative contracts which are not cleared by a central counterparty, including 
complying with requirements related to timely confirmation of terms, portfolio reconciliation, 
dispute resolution, daily valuation and margin posting (together, the “risk mitigation 
obligations”).  
Non-financial counterparties (as defined in EMIR) are not subject to the clearing obligation 
unless the gross notional value of all derivative contracts entered into by the non-financial 
counterparty and other non-financial entities in its “group”1, excluding eligible hedging 
transactions, exceed certain thresholds and its counterparty is also subject to the clearing 
obligation. If the Fund is considered to be a member of such a “group” (as defined in EMIR) 
                                                      
1 Group means the group of undertakings consisting of a parent undertaking and its subsidiaries within the 
meaning of Articles 1 and 2 of Directive 83/349/EEC or the group of undertakings referred to in Article 
3(1) and Article 80(7) and (8) of Directive 2006/48/EC. 
 


 
 
 
38 
and if the aggregate notional value of OTC derivative contracts entered into by the Fund and 
any non-financial entities within such group exceeds the applicable thresholds, the Fund 
would be subject to the clearing obligation or if the relevant contract is not a type required to 
be cleared, to the risk mitigation obligations, including the margin posting requirement based 
on the principle that counterparties have an obligation to protect themselves against credit 
exposures to derivatives counterparties by collecting margins where those contracts are not 
cleared by a central counterparty. 
Therefore, if the Fund becomes subject to the clearing obligation or the margin requirement, it 
is unlikely that it would be able to comply with such requirements, which would adversely 
affect the Fund's ability to enter into Hedging Agreements or significantly increase the cost 
thereof, negatively affecting the Fund's ability to hedge its interest rate risk. As a result of 
such increased costs, additional regulatory requirements and limitations on ability of the Fund 
to hedge interest rate risk, the amounts payable to Noteholders may be negatively affected. 
 
The clearing threshold for interest rate derivative contracts is EUR 3 billion (measured in 
gross notional value). Moreover, the Hedging Agreements which may be entered into by the 
Fund are eligible hedging transactions and, accordingly, will be excluded from the 
computation of the clearing threshold. 
 
The Hedging Agreements may contain early termination events which are based on the 
application of EMIR and which may allow the relevant Hedge Counterparty to terminate a 
Hedging Agreements upon the occurrence of such an event. The termination of a Hedging 
Agreement in these circumstances may result in a termination payment being payable by the 
Fund.  
 
 


 
 
 
39 
 
CERTAIN REGULATORY AND INDUSTRY 
DISCLOSURES 
1. COMPLIANCE WITH EU RISK RETENTION REQUIREMENTS 
The Seller, as an originator for the purposes of the CRR, the Regulation (EU) No. 231/2013 
of the EU Directive 2011/61/EU on Alternative Investment Fund Managers (the AIFMR) and 
the Solvency II Regulation, will retain, on an ongoing basis, a material net economic interest 
of not less than five per cent (5%) in the securitisation contemplated by the Programme 
Documents in accordance with article 405 of the CRR (Article 405), article 51 of the AIFMR 
(Article 51) and article 254 of the Solvency II Regulation (Article 254) (which, in each case, 
is interpreted and applied on the Disbursement Date and does not take into account any 
corresponding national measures) (the Retention).  
The Retention will comprise the Seller holding an interest in the first loss tranche represented 
in this case by Seller Interest Credit Facility, any Class of Notes retained by the Seller (if any 
and as specified in the relevant Issuing Document) and the subordinated facilities (Expenses 
Subordinated Facility, General Reserve Facility and Commingling Reserve Facility), as 
required by the text of each of paragraph (d) of Article 405(1) of the CRR, paragraph (d) of 
Article 51(1) of the AIFMR and paragraph (d) of Article 254(2) of the Solvency II 
Regulation. Any change to the manner in which such interest is held will be notified to 
Noteholders. Such Retention by the Seller is provided by means of the Seller Interest Credit 
Facility, any Class of Notes retained by the Seller (if any) and the subordinated facilities 
(Expenses Subordinated Facility, General Reserve Facility and Commingling Reserve 
Facility). As at the first Notes Issue Disbursement Date, such Retention will be provided by 
means of the Seller Interest Credit Facility and the subscription of the Class C2017-01 Notes 
and the subordinated facilities (Expenses Subordinated Facility, General Reserve Facility and 
Commingling Reserve Facility). 
This Retention option and the methodology used to calculate the net economic interest will 
not change, unless such change is required due to exceptional circumstances, in which case 
such change will be appropriately disclosed to Noteholders and published on the following 
website: (www.imtitulizacion.com). In compliance with article 409 of CRR, the Seller must 
ensure that all investors can easily access all necessary data regarding credit quality and the 
evolution of underlying positions and treasury flows backing the securitisation exposures, 
together with any information necessary to carry out detailed and documented stress tests of 
the cash flows backing the underlying exposures.  
As to the information made available to prospective investors by the Fund, reference is made 
to the information set out herein and forming part of this Base Prospectus and to any other 
information provided separately (which information shall not form part of this Base 
Prospectus), including the Seller Interest Credit Facility and, after the first Notes Issue 


 
 
 
40 
Disbursement Date, to the Investor Reports provided to the Noteholders and published on the 
following website: (www.imtitulizacion.com).  
The Seller will undertake to (i) the Arrangers and the relevant global coordinators, lead 
managers or underwriters and (ii) the Fund, in each case, for so long as any Notes remain 
outstanding, that it will: 
 
on the first Notes Issue Disbursement Date hold, and thereafter it will retain, on an 
(a)
ongoing basis, a material net economic interest of not less than five per cent. in the 
securitisation contemplated by the Programme Documents in accordance with Article 
405(1)(d) of the CRR, Article 51(1)(d) of the AIFMR taking into account Article 56 
of the AIFMR and Article 254(2)(d) of Solvency II Regulation which, in each case, is 
interpreted and applied on the first Notes Issue Disbursement Date and does not take 
into account any corresponding national measures; such retention by the Seller will be 
provided by means of the Seller Interest Credit Facility and/or any Class C Notes 
retained by the Seller (if any) and/or the principal of the subordinated facilities 
(Expenses Subordinated Facility, General Reserve Facility and Commingling Reserve 
Facility); this retention option and the methodology used to calculate the net 
economic interest will not change, unless such change is required due to exceptional 
circumstances and only to the extent permitted and in compliance with the 
requirements set out in CRR, the AIFMR and the Solvency II Regulation; 
 
comply with the disclosure obligations imposed on originator credit institutions under 
(b)
the CRR, the AIFMR and the Solvency II Regulation, including, but not limited to, by 
disclosing when any breach of the Retention commitment occurs or when the 
performance of the securitisation or underlying exposures materially change or 
following a breach of the agreements and documentation related to the Programme 
subject always to any requirement of law provided that the Seller will not be in breach 
of such undertaking if it fails to so comply due to events, actions or circumstances 
beyond the Seller’s control;  
 
not sell, hedge or otherwise mitigate its credit risk under its material net economic 
(c)
interest in the securitisation as provided by means of the Seller Interest Credit Facility 
and/or any Class of Notes retained by the Seller (if any), except to the extent 
permitted by the CRR, the AIFMR and the Solvency II Regulation; and 
 
communicate the Management Company, on a monthly basis, the compliance with 
(d)
the retention commitment assumed so that the latter can publish such information on 
its web site (www.imtitulizacion.com). For the purposes of this communication, the 
Seller must explicitly state that it has not carried out any action (credit risk hedging, 
sale, taking short positions, etc.) that might have undermined the application of the 
retention requirement. 
Each prospective investor is required to independently assess and determine the sufficiency of 
the information described above and in the Base Prospectus generally for the purposes of 
complying with each of Part Five of the CRR (including Article 405), Section Five of Chapter 


 
 
 
41 
III of the AIFMR (including Article 51) and Chapter VIII of Title I of the Solvency II 
Regulation (including Article 254) and any corresponding national measures which may be 
relevant and none of the Fund, the Management Company, the Seller, any global coordinator, 
lead manager (including the Joint Lead Managers), bookrunner or underwriter, the Arrangers, 
the Director, the Eligible Hedging Counterparties or any other party to the transaction makes 
any representation that the information described above or in the Base Prospectus is sufficient 
in all circumstances for such purposes. Investors who are uncertain as to the requirements 
which apply to them in respect of their relevant jurisdiction, should seek guidance from their 
regulator. 
In relation to the retention covenant to be given by the Seller to the Fund in the Seller Interest 
Credit Facility Agreement, the Master Receivables Sale and Purchase Agreement and the 
relevant Notes Subscription Agreements in accordance with the CRR, the AIFMR and the 
Solvency II Regulation regarding the material net economic interest to be retained, on an 
ongoing basis, by the Seller in the securitisation and (in respect of CRR only) certain 
requirements as to providing investor information in connection therewith, the Management 
Company, the Arrangers, the Director ,any global coordinator, lead manager (including the 
Joint Lead Managers), bookrunner or underwriter will not be under any obligation to monitor 
the compliance by the Seller with such covenant and will not be under any obligation to take 
any action in relation to non-compliance with such covenant.

Early liquidation of the issuer 
The Management Company will proceed to carry out the early liquidation of the Fund (the 
Early Liquidation) on the Payment Date on which (a) the last outstanding Purchased 
Receivable is extinguished or written-off; or (b) the Management Company transfers to (x) 
the Seller (or any other third party entity(ies), which can either belong the group of the Seller 
or not, authorized by the Seller for such purposes (the Authorised Entity(ies)); or (y) to any 
other third parties, all outstanding Purchased Receivables in a single transaction following the 
occurrence of a Fund Liquidation Event (the Fund Liquidation Date) in accordance with 
section 4.4.4 below. 
For these purposes, a Fund Liquidation Event shall mean the occurrence of any of the 
following circumstances: 
 
if so directed by the Seller, where the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of all 
(a)
outstanding Notes is equal or less than 10% of the aggregate Initial Principal Amount 
thereof; or  
 
where the Notes issued by the Fund are held solely by the Seller or there are no Notes 
(b)

mandatorily, if four (4) months have elapsed since the occurrence of an event giving 
(c)
rise to the mandatory replacement of the Management Company due to the 
declaration of an insolvency proceeding (concurso) thereof (as provided in article 33 
of Law 5/2015) or in case that its authorisation to act as management company were

prepared to take over the management of the Fund appointed pursuant to section 3.7.1 
of the Additional Building Block; or 
 
six (6) months prior to the Fund Legal Maturity Date; or 
(d)
 
when the Management Company has the consent and the express acceptance of all the 
(e)
Noteholders and the counterparties to the Fund (including for the avoidance of doubt 
the Seller), in relation to the payment of the amounts related to the Early Liquidation 
and the procedure to carry out such Early Liquidation. 
The Management Company will proceed to liquidate the Fund following the occurrence of a 
Fund Liquidation Event (once the CNMV and the Noteholders have been informed in the 
manner set out in section 4 of the Additional Building Block), such circumstance constituting 
an Accelerated Amortisation Event. 


 
 
 
47 
The liquidation of the Fund shall be made in accordance with the Accelerated Priority of 
Payments set out in section 3.4.7.2 of the Additional Building Block.  
4.4.4. 
Re-transfer and sale of the Purchased Receivables 
 
In the event of the occurrence of any Fund Liquidation Event, the Management 
(a)
Company, acting for and on behalf of the Fund, shall (i) immediately notify the Seller 
of the occurrence of any Fund Liquidation Event, and (ii) propose to the Seller to 
repurchase in a single transaction, under the terms and provisions hereinafter 
provided (the Offer to Retransfer) all the outstanding Purchased Receivables 
remaining among the assets of the Fund. The Offer to Retransfer shall include the 
Reference Repurchase Price (as defined below) calculated by the Management 
Company. 
The repurchase price of such Purchased Receivables (the Reference Repurchase 
Price) proposed by the Management Company to the Seller (or to any other 
Authorised Entity(ies)) shall correspond to the then Outstanding Principal Balances 
as defined in section 2.2 of the Additional Building Block) of the Purchased 
Receivables plus any accrued and unpaid outstanding interest. 
The Reference Repurchase Price applicable to the retransfer of the Purchased 
Receivables (together with any Fund Available Cash) shall be sufficient in order to 
enable the Fund to repay in full all amounts of any nature whatsoever, due and 
payable in respect of the outstanding Rated Notes (the Class A Notes and the Class B 
Notes and eventually the Class C Notes), after the payment by the Fund of all 
liabilities ranking pari passu with or in priority to those amounts in the relevant 
Accelerated Priority of Payments. 
 
The repurchase of the Purchased Receivables remaining among the assets of the Fund 
(b)
shall take place on a Repurchase Date and, at the earliest, on the first Repurchase 
Date following the date on which an Offer to Retransfer is sent to the Seller upon the 
Fund Liquidation Event has been declared by the Management Company. The 
proceeds of the Reference Repurchase Price shall be credited on the relevant 
Repurchase Date to the Treasury Account. 
 
The Seller may acquire on its own or designate any entity to repurchase part or all the 
(c)
Purchased Receivables. Such designated entity shall repurchase the Purchased 
Receivables under the same terms and conditions applicable to the Seller; in 
particular, the designated entity shall be entitled to repurchase part or all the 
Purchased Receivables provided that no Insolvency Event has occurred in relation to 
such designated entity. 
 
Other than in the events foreseen in paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 4.4.3 above, the 
(d)
Seller shall be entitled to refuse any Offer to Retransfer made by the Management 
Company.  


 
 
 
48 
By no later than thirty (30) calendar days following receipt of the Offer to Retransfer 
(or within such other notice period as may be agreed upon by the Management 
Company, the Seller and/or the relevant Authorised Entity), the Seller and/or the 
Authorised Entity shall notify in writing their acceptance or refusal of the Offer to 
Retransfer. If, upon the expiry of that period, the Seller and/or the Authorised Entity 
have failed to reply, they shall be deemed to have refused the Offer to Retransfer.  
 
If the Seller and/or the Authorised Entity refuse(s) such offer, the Management 
(e)
Company shall offer the Purchased Receivables to (i) at least three (3) entities among 
those most active in the purchase and sale of similar assets and (ii) the Seller 
(provided no Insolvency Event has occurred in respect thereto), which all of them 
may bid concurrently and without preference amongst themselves.  
The Management Company shall set out the terms and conditions of the bidding 
process (including, without limitation, the information to be provided to the bidders 
and deadline to submit the bids) in the manner it considers best to maximise the value 
of the Purchased Receivables. 
In such case, the Management shall accept the best offer received for the Purchased 
Receivables from any of such third entities or the Seller. The Seller shall enjoy a pre-
emption right to match the best offer received by the Management Company. 
If no relevant offer is received from any third parties or the Seller, then the Purchased 
Receivables shall remain as assets to the Fund, without prejudice to the possibility of 
the Management Company to start a new auction process for the sale of the 
Purchased Receivables in the terms set out in this paragraph.  
 
The Management Company may obtain any appraisal reports it deems necessary from 
(f)
third-party entities in order to run the liquidation process, including any valuation 
reports from third parties to determine the market value of the outstanding Purchased 
Receivables. 
In case of retransfer of Purchased Receivables under the conditions set out in the 
preceding paragraphs, the retransfer document shall take the form of a private 
retransfer document or, upon request from the relevant purchaser, a public deed 
(escritura or póliza) of retransfer.  
 
The Reference Repurchase Price shall be paid by Seller (or the relevant Authorised 
(g)
Entity) or the third party entity winning the auction process to the Fund in the 
Treasury Account so designated by the Management Company. 
 
Once all the Purchased Receivables have been sold in accordance with the above, the 
(h)
Management Company will apply all the amounts that it obtains through the disposal 
of the assets of the Fund, together with the rest of the Fund Available Cash that the 
Fund might have at that time, to the payment of the different items, in the form, 
amount and in accordance with the Accelerated Priority of Payments set out in section 
3.4.7.2 of the Additional Building Block. 


 
 
 
49

to cancel its registration in the corresponding administrative registries until it has 
completed the sale of the remaining assets of the Fund and the distribution of the 
Fund Available Cash in accordance with the above.

Fee in accordance with section 3.4.7.4 of the Additional Building Block.  
4.4.6. 
Extinguishment of the Fund 
The Fund will be extinguished, in any event, as a result of the following circumstances:

deed (acta) declaring (i) the extinguishment of the Fund and the reasons, as set out in this 
Base Prospectus, for the extinguishment, (ii) the procedure followed in notifying the

Relevant Rating Agencies have not been confirmed (or if such ratings are

affect nor cause the termination of any of the Note Series previously issued by the Fund. 
If the Note Series to be issued on the Fund Incorporation Date is early terminated in 
accordance with this section for any reason (other than the occurrence of the event foreseen in

In the event foreseen in the preceding paragraph, the transfer of the Receivables to the Fund

5.1. 
Brief description of the issuer’s main activities 
The Fund will be set up as a securitisation fund (fondo de titulización), pursuing the principal 
activities summarized below and explained in detail throughout this Base Prospectus. 
The purpose of the Fund is to: 
 
acquire Eligible Receivables from the Seller; and 
(a)
 
finance in full the acquisition of such Eligible Receivables through the issue of the 
(b)
Note Series, the drawings under the Seller Interest Credit Facility, the Deferred 
Purchase Price and/or by allocating principal collections of Purchased Receivables.  
The proceeds from principal and interest (ordinary and accrued) of the Purchased Receivables 
received by the Fund will be allocated at the frequency set out in each Notes Series, on each 
Payment Date, to the payment of any amount that the Fund is obliged to pay, in accordance 
with the relevant Priority of Payments established in section 3.4.7.2 of the Additional 
Building Block. 
This Base Prospectus refers to the issue programme (the Programme) of Notes that are 
issued by the Fund backed by Receivables. 
The Programme will be used to arrange successive issues of Notes, arranged in Note 
Series up to the Maximum Outstanding Balance of the Programme from time to time (as 
defined in section 5.1.1 below). 
The Notes Series may be issued during the Programme Revolving Period, provided that the 
conditions established for the issue of Notes Series set out in section 4.12 of the Securities 
Note are met. 
In addition, the Fund, represented by the Management Company, will arrange for the 
provision of services in order to consolidate the financial structure of the Fund, to increase the 


 
 
 
55 
security and regularity of the payment of the Notes, and, in general, to enable the financial 
transformation which takes place in the Fund between the financial characteristics of the 
Receivables and the financial characteristics of the Notes. 
5.1.1. Maximum Outstanding Balance of the Programme 
The maximum aggregate nominal amount of all Note Series from time to time outstanding 
under the Programme will not exceed EUR 3,000,000,000 (the Maximum Outstanding 
Balance of the Programme). 
Any increase of the Maximum Outstanding Balance of the Programme by the Management 
Company and the Seller may require the corresponding amendment to the Deed of 
Incorporation of the Fund with the prior consent of all the Noteholders and the other creditors 
of the Fund (excluding non-financial creditors) and a Prospectus Supplement to the Base 
Prospectus (unless such increase is made simultaneously with an annual renewal of the Base 
Prospectus). In any case, any increase of the Maximum Outstanding Balance of the 
Programme should not result in the downgrade of any outstanding Notes by the Relevant 
Rating Agencies. 
5.1.2. Issues of Notes Series 
The Management Company may arrange for Notes Series being issued by the Fund provided 
that the Maximum Outstanding Balance of the Programme is not exceeded. 
The Fund shall be entitled to issue Note Series (i) on the Fund Incorporation Date and 
thereafter (ii) on each Issue Date until the end of the Programme Revolving Period. The Fund 
shall not issue any Note Series during the Programme Amortisation Period and the 
Programme Accelerated Amortisation Period. 
The issue of any Note Series (i) on the Fund Incorporation Date shall be subject to the 
satisfaction of the Initial Note Series Issuance Conditions Precedent as described in section 
3.3.1.2 of the Securities Note and (ii) on any Issue Date after the Fund Incorporation Date 
shall be subject to the satisfaction of the Further Note Series Issuance Conditions Precedent as 
described in section 3.3.1.24.12.3 of the Securities Note. 
Subscription or holding of Notes of one Notes Series does not imply subscription or holding 
Notes of other Notes Series. In any case, investors who purchase Notes of a given Notes 
Series will not have a right to object to the issue of Notes of additional Notes Series, and 
therefore the consent of the Noteholders of the Notes already issued will not be required. 
5.1.3. Funding Strategy of the Fund 
The funding strategy of the Fund is to issue the Note Series, the net proceeds of such Notes, 
together with the drawings under the Seller Interest Credit Facility, the Deferred Purchase 
Price and allocation of principal collections of Purchased Receivables, will be applied to (i) 
purchase from the Seller during the Programme Revolving Period, the Programme 
Amortisation Period and, if any, the Programme Accelerated Amortisation Period, portfolios 


 
 
 
56 
of Eligible Receivables (as described in section 3.3 of the Additional Building Block) and/or 
(ii) to redeem existing Note Series and/or (iii) to repay the Seller Interest Credit Facility 
and/or the Aggregate Deferred Purchase Price.  
5.1.4. Hedging Strategy of the Fund 
If the Notes of any Note Series are Floating Rate Notes and unless such Floating Rate Notes 
have a Maximum Interest Rate, the Fund may enter into one or several Hedging Agreements 
with one or several Eligible Hedging Counterparty(ies) in order to hedge its exposure with 
respect to any Floating Rate Notes of any Note Series against the fixed interest rate of the 
Purchased Receivables. Additional details on the hedging strategy of the Fund are included in 
section 3.4.8 of the Additional Building Block. 
5.1.5. Cross-collateralisation 
Each Note Series will be collateralised by the whole portfolio of outstanding Purchased 
Receivables (the Securitised Portfolio) which have been purchased by the Fund on each 
Purchase Date pursuant to the terms of the Master Receivables Sale and Purchase Agreement.  
Each Note of each Note Series will have recourse and receive payments from the Purchased 
Receivables as a whole (subject to the then applicable Priority of Payments) irrespective of 
their respective Issue Dates, Scheduled Amortisation Starting Dates and Notes Final Legal 
Maturity Dates of the relevant Note Series.

4.2. 
Description of the type and class of the Notes 
4.2.1 
Type and class of the Notes 
The Notes are asset-backed notes that represent a debt of the Fund, accrue interest and are 
redeemable on each Payment Date during their applicable Note Series Amortisation Period. 
The Notes legally qualify as marketable fixed income securities with an explicit yield and are 
subject to the provisions of the Legislative Royal Decree 4/2015, dated 23 October, approving 
the consolidated text of the Securities Market Law (Real Decreto Legislativo 4/2015, de 23 de 
octubre, por el que se aprueba el texto refundido de la Ley del Mercado de Valores) (the 
Legislative Royal Decree 4/2015) and its development regulations and are issued pursuant to 
Law 5/2015. 
Notes issued by the Fund under the Programme are issued in Notes Series. A Note Series 
shall be comprised by the following classes of Notes (each a Class): 
 


 
 
 
70 
 
 Class A notes (the Class A Notes); and 
(a)
 Class C notes (the Class C Notes).  
(b)
Additionally, a Note Series may also include Class B notes (the Class B Notes)   
Upon issue, no Note Series shall be composed by a single Class of Notes or a combination of 
(i) Class B Notes and Class C Notes or (ii) Class A Notes and Class B Notes, exclusively. 
All Notes of a particular Class of Notes of a Notes Series shall have the same interest rate, 
Scheduled Amortisation Starting Date, Notes Final Legal Maturity Date and will be paid on 
the same rank. Interest calculation may differ between Classes of Notes. 
However, a Class of Notes of a specific Note Series will not necessarily be subject to identical 
terms in all respects as those of the same Class of Notes of a different Note Series.  
Please see section 7.5 of the Securities Note with respect to the ratings of the Notes of each 
Notes Series.  
4.2.2 
Currency 
The Notes of any Note Series will be always denominated in EUR.  
4.2.3 
Interest (fixed/floating) 
Each Class of Notes of any Note Series may bear a fixed interest rate or a floating interest (as 
specified in the relevant Issuing Document). 
In the case of each Class of Notes of any Note Series bearing a floating interest rate as 
specified in the relevant Issuing Document for that particular Note Series, and unless such 
floating rate notes have a Maximum Interest Rate (as defined in section 4.7.3 below), a 
separate hedging transaction may be entered into by the Fund to convert the fixed amounts 
received by the Fund as applicable floating amounts for payments in respect of that Note 
Series. 
4.2.4 
Issue of Note Series 
So long as:  
 
the Initial Note Series Issuance Conditions Precedent set out in section 4.12.1 of the 
(a)
Securities Note have been satisfied, the Fund may issue, upon decision of the Seller, 
one or several Note Series on the Fund Incorporation Date; and  
 
the Further Note Series Issuance Conditions Precedent set out in section 4.12.1 of the 
(b)
Securities Note have been satisfied, the Fund may issue, upon decision of the Seller, 
additional Note Series on each Issue Date until the end of the Programme Revolving 
Period. The Fund is not required to permit any prior review by or to obtain the 


 
 
 
71 
 
consent of any Noteholder of any outstanding Note Series to issue any additional 
Note Series. 
4.2.5 
Issuing Document 
Each Note Series will be the subject of the corresponding Issuing Document. The terms and 
conditions applicable to any particular Note Series shall be described in the corresponding 
Issuing Document. 
4.2.6 
Representation and denomination of the Notes  
The Notes of any Note Series will be issued in book-entry form or registered titles in the 
denomination of EUR 100,000 each.  
The Notes of each Notes Series may be unlisted or listed on AIAF. Consequently,  
 
within a Note Series it is possible that certain Classes of Notes are listed in the 
(a)
above mentioned market whilst other are not;  
 
within the same Class of Notes (across different Note Series) it is possible to 
(b)
have Notes which may be unlisted or listed in the above mentioned market; and 
 
Notes of a given Class within a Notes Series must be either listed or unlisted (but 
(c)
not both simultaneously).  
Where applicable, the Management Company, acting for and on behalf of the Fund, will 
request the inclusion of the listed Class of Notes of a Notes Series issued under the 
Programme in IBERCLEAR. 
The information about the ISIN (International Securities Identification Number) of each of 
the Notes of the corresponding Notes Series under this Programme will be set out in the 
Issuing Document of the corresponding Notes Series (if applicable). 
4.2.7 
Note Series and Notes 
All Class A Notes, all Class B Notes (if any) and all Class C Notes issued on the same Issue 
Date will constitute a Note Series, which shall be designated by means of: 
 
a four digit number representing the year on which the Note Series was issued, in the 
(a)
following format: Note Series “20xx”; followed by 
 
the number of such Note Series in respect of the relevant year, in the following 
(b)
format: “yy”. 
Consequently, each Note Series will present in the following format: Note Series 20xx-yy. 
All Notes of the same Class and Note Series shall have the exact same characteristics and 
therefore be fungible amongst themselves. 


 
 
 
72 
 
The Class A Notes, the Class B Notes and the Class C Notes of any Note Series should 
present in the following format: Class A20xx-yy Notes, Class B20xx-yy Notes and Class 
C20xx-yy Notes, respectively. 
The Class A20xx-yy Notes, the Class B20xx-yy Notes and the Class C20xx-yy Notes of a 
given Note Series shall have: 
 
the same Interest Period and the same Payment Date (as defined in section 4.7.2 of 
(a)
this Securities Note).  
 
the same Scheduled Amortisation Starting Date which shall be specified in the 
(b)
applicable Issuing Document. A Note Series 20xx-yy Call Date may be a Scheduled 
Amortisation Starting Date, provided that:

In accordance with section 4.8 of the Securities Note, the election by the 
Fund, represented by the Management Company and following a Seller's 
Optional Early Redemption Written Instruction to exercise the (i) optional 
redemption of the relevant Note Series on the applicable Note Series 20xx-yy 
Clean-Up Call Date or (ii) the optional redemption of the relevant Note Series

Document shall constitute an Optional Early Redemption Event. 
(ii) 
If one or several Note Series 20xx-yy Call Date(s) are specified in the 
relevant Issuing Document, the Class A20xx-yy Notes, the Class B20xx-yy 
Notes and the Class C20xx-yy Notes in respect of such given Note Series 
shall have the same Note Series 20xx-yy Call Date(s).  
(iii) 
The Management Company, on behalf of the Fund, will (if directed to do so 
by the Seller), on the Payment Date and on any subsequent Payment Date on 
which the Note Series 20xx-yy Clean-Up Call Condition is satisfied (the 
Note Series 20xx-yy Clean-Up Call Date), redeem any outstanding Note 
Series in an amount equal to the applicable Note Series 20xx-yy Clean-Up 
Call Amount.  
For this purpose: 
Note Series 20xx-yy Clean-Up Call Date” means, in respect of any Note Series 20xx-yy, the 
Payment Date on which the Note Series 20xx-yy Clean-Up Call Condition is satisfied and any 
subsequent Payment Date. 
 
“Note Series 20xx-yy Clean-Up Call Amount” means, on a Payment Date and in respect of 
the Note Series 20xx-yy, an amount equal to the positive difference between: 
 
the Principal Amount Outstanding of such Note Series 20xx-yy on the immediately 
(a)
preceding Payment Date; and 


 
 
 
73 
 
 
the Note Series 20xx-yy Available Amortisation Amount with respect to such 
(b)
Payment Date

(c)
Issuing Document. 
4.3. 
Appointment of global coordinators, lead managers, bookrunners or underwriters in 
connection with the issue of the Notes 
The entities participating as global coordinators, lead managers, bookrunners or underwriters 
of the Notes in each Notes Series will be designated in the corresponding Issuing Document.

which the Notes are issued and which are detailed in sections 4.7 and 4.8 below of this

of the Notes, to the relevant Priority of Payments set out in section 3.4.7.2 of the Additional 
Building Block. 
The Noteholders will have no recourse against the Management Company, other than from 
non-performance of its duties or non-compliance with the provisions of this Base Prospectus, 
of the Deed of Incorporation and the applicable laws and regulations. In this regard, no action 
of the Noteholders against the Management Company shall be based on (i) delinquency or 
prepayment of the Receivables; (ii) non-fulfilment by the counterparties of the transactions 


 
 
 
81

enhancements to cover the payments of the Notes of any Class. 
The Noteholders shall have no actions against the Borrowers that have failed to comply with 
their payments obligations. In this regard, the Management Company, as legal representative 
of the Fund and acting on its own name, or the Servicer, will be the only persons empowered 
to address any action. The duties and responsibilities of the Management Company are 
described in section 3.7.1.1 of the Additional Building Block. 
Any issue, discrepancy or dispute regarding the Fund or the Notes that may arise during its

Interest Rate applicable to the Notes of any Note Series for the relevant Interest 
Period. 
 
Interest Rate for Floating Rate Notes 
(b)
The Interest Rate in respect of Floating Rate Notes of any Note Series for each 
Interest Period will be the result of adding the Relevant Margin (or the Step-Up 
Margin) to the Reference Rate and shall be determined in the manner specified in the 
relevant Issuing Document; the provisions below relating to Reference Rate 
determination shall apply.  
For this purpose Reference Rate shall be the EURIBOR for one (1) month. 
The Reference Rate for each Interest Period will, subject as provided below, be:

which represents the linear interpolation of the relevant EURIBOR rates for 
such period as specified in the relevant Issuing Document) on the Interest 
Determination Date in question as notified by the Paying Agent to the 
Management Company;  
(ii) 
if the Relevant Screen Page is not available as at the time specified above, 
then the rate for any relevant period shall be the arithmetic mean (rounded to 
four decimal places with the mid-point rounded upwards) of the offered 
quotations (expressed as a percentage rate per annum) notified to the Paying 
Agent at its request by each of the principal Euro-zone office of each of the 
Reference Banks as the rate at which euro deposits in respect of the relevant 
period in a representative amount are offered by the Reference Bank to 
leading banks in the euro-zone interbank for the Reference Rate at 
approximately 11.00 a.m. (Brussels time) on the Interest Determination Date 
in question; and 
(iii) 
if, at the time, the Reference Rate is unavailable and only two of the 
Reference Banks provide such quoted rate to the Paying Agent, the relevant 
rate will be determined on the basis of the average quoted rate of such two 
Reference Banks able to provide such quotations; or  


 
 
 
87 
 
(iv) 
if, at the time, the Reference Rate is unavailable and only one or none of the 
Reference Banks provides the Paying Agent with such quoted rate, the rate in 
effect for the immediately preceding Interest Period will apply or in the 
absence of such, the immediately preceding Business Day where such 
Reference Rate is available. 
The Paying Agent shall communicate to the Management Company by email, before 
13:00 CET of the Interest Determination Date, the Reference Rate including the 
supporting documentation for such calculations. 
 
Relevant Margin and Step-up Margin 
(c)
The Relevant Margin and, as applicable, the Step-up Margin for the Floating Rate 
Notes shall be specified in the applicable Issuing Document. 
 
Rounding 
(d)

to seven significant figures (with halves being rounded up) and (z) all EUR amounts 
that fall due and payable shall be rounded to the nearest lowest amount of EUR that is 
available as legal tender (with halves being rounded up).  
 
Capped or floored Euribor  
(e)
If any Notes of any Note Series are Floating Rate Notes, the applicable EURIBOR 
may be capped or floored at a certain level which shall be specified in the applicable 
Issuing Document.  
 
Floor Interest Rate 
(f)
The Interest Rate accrued by the Notes of any Notes Series during each Interest 
Period will be for any Floating Rate the maximum between zero percent (0%) and the 
result of adding (a) the Reference Rate (rounded in accordance with the provisions 
above); and (b) the Relevant Margin or the relevant Step-up Margin (as the case may 
be).  
 
Calculations 
(g)
The amount of interest payable in respect of any Floating Rate Note of any Note 
Series for any period shall be calculated by multiplying the product of the Interest 
Rate and the Principal Amount Outstanding of such Note by the Day Count Fraction. 
 
 


 
 
 
88 
 
 
Notification of the Notes Interest Amount 
(h)
The Management Company shall notify the Class A20xx-yy Notes Interest Amount, 
the Class B20xx-yy Notes Interest Amount and the Class C20xx-yy Notes Interest 
Amount of any Note Series applicable for the relevant Interest Period to the Paying 
Agent at least one (1) Business Day prior to each Payment Date (or such other date as 
agreed between the Management Company and the Paying Agent from time to time).

fully redeemed (a) on the applicable Note Series 20xx-yy Call Date (if a Note 
Series 20xx-yy Call Date is specified in the applicable Issuing Document), or (b) 
the 
established 
Note 
Series 
Reimbursement 
Date 
(if 
a 
Note 
Series Reimbursement Date is specified in the applicable Issuing Document) 
when such Note Series Reimbursement Date arrives and the Issuer decides to 
extend said date subject to the previous acceptance by the Noteholders, (the 
Step-up Interest Rate).  
Such Step-up Interest Rate will be applicable after such date and shall replace the 
Interest Rate. 
The Step-up Interest Rate shall be specified in the applicable Issuing Document.

Payments under the Notes 
4.7.8.1 General  
Payments of principal and interest (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any arrears of 
interest, where applicable) in respect of the Notes of any Note Series in accordance with the 
Priority of Payments set out in section 3.4.7.2 of the Additional Building Block will be made:  
 
in case of listed Notes, by transfer to the account of the relevant participants in 
(a)
IBERCLEAR to distribute the corresponding amounts to the relevant Note Series 
Noteholders. The payment will be made through the Paying Agent, using 
IBERCLEAR and its participative entities to distribute the corresponding amounts.  
 
in case of unlisted Notes in book-entry form, by transfer to the account duly notified 
(b)
by the Noteholder to the duly licensed financial institution appointed by the 
Management Company to manage such registry, for such purposes. The payment will 
be made through the Paying Agent. 
 
in case of unlisted Notes in registered form, by transfer to the account duly notified 
(c)
by the Noteholder to the Management Company for such purposes. The payment will 
be made through the Paying Agent.  
The Fund, acting through the Management Company, will not postpone the payment of 
interest (or principal) of the Notes later than the Fund Legal Maturity Date.  
Payments in respect of principal and interest on the Notes will, in all cases, be made subject to 
any tax or other laws and regulations applicable thereto. No fees or expenses shall be charged 
to the Note Series Noteholders in respect of such payments. Payments of principal and 
interest in respect of the Notes shall be made net of any withholding tax (if any) applicable to 
the Notes of any Note Series in the relevant state or jurisdiction, and neither the Fund, the 
Management Company, any Eligible Hedging Counterparties or the Paying Agent shall be 
under any obligation to gross up such amounts as a consequence or otherwise compensate the 
Noteholders for the lesser amounts the Noteholders will receive as a result of such 


 
 
 
90 
 
withholding or deduction. Any such imposition of withholding taxes will result in the 
Noteholders receiving a lesser amount in respect of the payments on the Notes. The ratings to 
be assigned by the Relevant Rating Agencies to the Rated Notes will not address the 
likelihood of the imposition of withholding taxes.  
Any current or future withholdings, rates and taxes to which the capital, interest or yields of 
the Notes are subject will be exclusively assumed by the Noteholders and, where applicable, 
their corresponding amount will be deducted by the entity obliged to do so in the legally 
established manner. 
4.7.8.2 Payment Dates  
Further to section 4.7.2 above Note Series will have a Payment Date.  
If the Payment Date of any amount of principal or interest in respect of any Note is not a 
Business Day, the Modified Following Business Day Convention shall apply. If any payment 
is postponed as a result of the foregoing, the Note Series Noteholders shall not be entitled to 
any interest or other sums in respect of such postponed payment.  
4.7.8.3 Distributions 
On each Payment Date during the Programme Revolving Period and the Programme 
Amortisation Period, the Available Interest Amount and the Available Principal Amount, 
together with the General Reserve under certain conditions, shall be applied in making the 
payments referred to in the Interest Priority of Payments and Principal Priority of Payments. 
Prior to each Payment Date, the Management Company shall make the relevant calculations 
and determinations in connection with each Priority of Payments. 
On each Payment Date during the Programme Accelerated Amortisation Period, the Available 
Distribution Amount shall be applied in making the payments referred to in the Accelerated 
Priority of Payments. 
4.7.9 
Calculation Agent 
The calculation agent in respect of the Notes shall be the Management Company. 
4.8. 
Maturity Date and redemption of the securities

Document and subject to the relevant Modified Following Business Day Convention) in 
accordance with the applicable Priority of Payments (the Notes Final Legal Maturity Date).  


 
 
 
91 
 
Any part of the nominal value of any Class of Notes of any Note Series or of the interest due 
on thereon which may remain unpaid shall be automatically cancelled after the applicable

Indication of the yield  
No assurance can be made of the amount of payments that will be made on the Notes on each

Receivables during the preceding Collection Period.  
The average life, duration, yield to maturity, term, estimated maturity date, and any other 
metric of the Notes in general cannot be predicted with any certainty, as a number of other 
factors on which they rely are unknown. The most significant unknown factors upon which 
payment of the Notes depend are (i) collections under the Receivables and changes in the 
receivables payment terms, (ii) change of Notes Series Interest Rate (if Floating Interest Rate 


 
 
 
105 
 
Note Series), (iii) capacity of the Borrowers to prepay, in full or in part, the Receivables, (iv) 
payment rate of the Receivables, (v) availability of Receivables eligible for purchase, (vi) the 
default rates of the Borrowers, (vii) the exercise by the Seller of any early redemption option, 
and (viii) the occurrence of an Early Liquidation Event, a Revolving Termination Event or an 
Accelerated Amortisation Event.  
Notwithstanding the above, estimations of the actual interest and principal payable to a 
subscriber who acquires the Notes of a Notes Series, will be indicated by way of example in 
the corresponding Issuing Document, along with estimations of the average life, yield to 
maturity, duration, and estimated maturity date of such Notes which will be calculated using 
certain information, hypothesis and assumptions, amongst others:  
 
the Disbursement Date of the Note Series 20xx-yy; 
(a)
 
the Scheduled Amortisation Starting Date; 
(b)
 
for the purposes of this section the cut-off date will be specified , as the Fund relevant 
(c)
Cut-Off Date prior to the issuance of such Notes (with explicit indication of such 
date), except for the Notes issued on the Fund Incorporation Date which will be the 
16 of June 2017 corresponding to the reference date of the Audited Portfolio; 
 
that on the Disbursement Date of the Note Series 20xx-yy, the Outstanding Principal 
(d)
Balances of the Purchased Receivables is equal to the Minimum Portfolio Amount as 
of such date. New Receivables are purchased (if required) in order to maintain such 
Minimum Portfolio Amount until the Scheduled Amortisation Starting Date of the 
Note Series 20xx-yy; 
 
that the composition and the amortisation profile of the portfolio of the Purchased 
(e)
Receivables (and the new Receivables purchased during the Note Series Non-
Amortisation Period of the outstanding Note Series) is similar to the composition and 
amortisation profile of the performing portfolio as at the cut-off date prior to the 
issuance of such Notes; 
 
no new issuance of further Note Series occurs (however for calculation purposes, 
(f)
previously issued and outstanding Notes Series are considered); 
 
the Seller does not repurchase any Receivables purchased by the Fund; 
(g)
 
the rate of defaults on the Receivables will be specified in the corresponding Issuing 
(h)
Document; 
 
interest payments on the Receivables will be received, if any at the applicable interest 
(i)
rate offered by WIZINK as the cut-off date. No adjustment of the applicable interest 
rate under the Revolving Credit Agreements is offered by WIZINK; 
 
the Fund excess margin remains sufficient to cover all defaulted amounts; 
(j)


 
 
 
106 
 
 
principal payments and prepayments on the Receivables will be received, if any, at 
(k)
the relevant constant monthly principal payment rate specified in the corresponding 
Issuing Document; 
 
the calculation of the weighted average life (in years) is calculated on 
(l)
an Actual/Actual basis; 
 
the Note Series 20xx-yy Clean-Up Call Conditions will not be considered applicable;  
(m)
 
none of the Fund Liquidation Events are considered applicable; 
(n)
 
payment of principal and interest due and payable under the Notes will be received on 
(o)
the 26 day of each relevant Note Series Payment Date;  
 
zero per cent investment return is earned on the Issuer Accounts; 
(p)
 
no Revolving Termination Event has occurred; 
(q)
 
no Accelerated Amortisation Event has occurred;  
(r)
 
it is not necessary to use the Commingling Reserve or the General Reserve. 
(s)
These estimates will have certain inherent limitations. No representations will be made that 
such estimates are accurate, that all assumptions relating to such estimates have been 
considered or stated or that such estimates will be realised.

5. ADMISSION TO TRADING AND DEALING ARRANGEMENTS 
5.1. 
Market where the securities will be traded 
The Notes may be unlisted or listed on AIAF. There is no obligation for the Notes of all Notes 
Series to be listed on any markets. 
Where the Notes are to be listed on AIAF, the Management Company shall carry out its best 
efforts to achieve that the admission to trading of the Notes of each Notes Series on such 
market is carried out not later than thirty (30) calendar days after the corresponding 
Disbursement Date set out in the corresponding Issuing Document. The Management 
Company will also, on behalf of the Fund, request the inclusion of the listed Notes of each 
Notes Series in IBERCLEAR so that clearing and settlement may be carried out under the 
operating rules established or that may be approved in the future by IBERCLEAR with regard 
to the securities admitted to trading on the on AIAF and represented by book entries.  
The Management Company shall carry out its best efforts in order that each listed Notes 
Series is included in the registries of IBERCLEAR. 
In the event of a failure to meet the deadline for the admission of the listed Notes of any 
Notes Series to trading, the Management Company undertakes to report a relevant fact (hecho 
relevante) to the CNMV and make the announcement in the corresponding mean foreseen in 


 
 
 
121 
 
in AIAF or in any other media generally accepted by the market which guarantees adequate 
dissemination of the information, in time and content, concerning the reasons for such breach 
and the new date for admission of the issued securities to trading, without prejudice of the 
possible liability of the Management Company if the breach is due to reasons attributable 
thereto. 
The Management Company, in the name and on behalf of the Fund, represents that it is aware 
of the requirements and conditions that may be requested for the listing, maintenance and de-
listing of the securities with AIAF, in accordance with the applicable regulation, as well as the 
requirements by the governing bodies of the latter, and the Management Company accepts to 
comply with them.  
It is not foreseen to enter into any agreement with an entity that will undertake to facilitate the 
liquidity of the Notes during the life of the Fund.  
Where the Notes are not listed in any market, the Management Company shall comply with 
the provisions set out in section 4.5.1 4.2.6 of the Securities Note.  
5.2. 
Paying Agent 
The Management Company, acting for and on behalf of the Fund, appoints Banco Santander 
as Paying Agent in order to carry out certain financial services (Financial Agency) in relation 
to the Notes of each Note Series issued by the Fund with effects from the Fund Incorporation 
Date. 
5.2.1. Obligations of the Paying Agent 
The Paying Agent obligations are summarised as follows: 
 
On each Notes Issue Disbursement Date, and once instructions from the Management 
(a)
Company are received, effect the necessary payments to meet the disbursement 
process, the subscription of the Notes and, if applicable, payment of the Receivables 
purchased or the calling of a Note Series in the immediately next payment Date. In 
any event, payment of these amounts may be carried out in net amounts.  
 
On each Payment Date, payment of interest and reimbursement of principal of the 
(b)
Notes, once the total tax withholdings have been made accordingly with current tax 
regulations. 
 
On each Payment Date (or any other payment date in case of Extraordinary Expenses) 
(c)
of the Fund, carry out any payment required by the Management Company in relation 
to the Fund. 
 
If there are no Available Distribution Amount in the Treasury Account on a Payment 
(d)
Date, the Paying Agent will not be required to make any payments. 


 
 
 
122 
 
The Paying Agent shall carry out the functions entrusted under this section upon receipt of the 
relevant instructions from the Management Company, together with any information and data 
required by the Paying Agent for the performance of any such functions.  
Any instructions received by the Paying Agent from the Management Company shall be 
deemed valid and effective, without the Paying Agent being obliged to verify the suitability, 
appropriateness or adequacy of such instructions. Consequently, the Paying Agent shall be 
released from any liability arising from their execution and/or processing in good faith (save 
where the Paying Agent has incurred in willful misconduct or negligence (either by act or by 
omission). 
In the event of failure or delay by the Management Company to provide the relevant 
instructions or information (in whole or in part), the Paying Agent shall not perform any 
action until such instructions or information are received. The Paying Agent shall make the 
Fund payments, in accordance with the relevant Priority of Payments set out in section 3.4.7.2 
of the Additional Building Block: 
 
on each Payment Date; and  
(a)
 
on any other date scheduled for such payment as set out in the Deed of Incorporation 
(b)
or the Base Prospectus,  
by debiting the Treasury Account, after receiving appropriate instructions of the Management 
Company. 
The instructions of the Management Company to the Paying Agent must be received by the 
Paying Agent at least two (2) Business Day before the relevant Payment Date (with respect to 
payments of interest or principal under the Notes) or two (2) Business Day before the date on 
which the Paying Agent shall effect the corresponding payment (in all the other cases).  
In case that such instructions are not received on time, the Paying Agent shall immediately 
notify the Management Company of such circumstance so that the Management Company 
instructs the Paying Agent accordingly. In the absence of any such instructions, the Paying 
Agent will not make any payment. 
Given that in accordance with the 3.4.5 of the Additional Building Block the Issuer Accounts 
will not be allowed to have a negative balance to the detriment of the Fund, in the event that 
the relevant Issuer Account does not have sufficient funds to make the corresponding 
payment in accordance with instructions received from the Management Company, the 
Paying Agent shall notify the Management Company, and shall refrain from making any 
payment until it receives further instructions from the Management Company. 
The payments of principal and interest in respect of the Notes of any Note Series in 
accordance with the Priority of Payments set out in section 3.4.7.2 of the Additional Building 
Block will be made: 


 
 
 
123 
 
 
in case of listed Notes, by transfer to the account of the relevant participants in 
(a)
IBERCLEAR (the Participant Entities) at which the Notes of the relevant Note 
Series are registered, according to the procedures of IBERCLEAR applicable from 
time to time;  
 
in case of unlisted Notes in book-entry form, by transfer to the account duly notified 
(b)
by the Noteholder to the duly licensed financial institution appointed by the 
Management Company to manage such registry, for such purposes; and  
 
in case of unlisted Notes in registered form, by transfer to the account duly notified 
(c)
by the Noteholder to the Management Company. 
Upon the occurrence of an unforeseen event which, in the Paying Agent’s sole opinion, would 
make the execution of such instructions risky or harmful, the Paying Agent shall suspend the 
performance of its functions and immediately seek new instructions from the Management 
Company.  
The Management Company shall provide such instructions to the Paying Agent as soon as 
possible in the manner provided in this section. If as a result of the delay by the Management 
Company to provide such new instructions a delay is caused in the payments to be effected by 
the Fund, the Management Company shall not claim any amount to the Paying Agent in 
connection thereto and the Fund shall hold the Paying Agent harmless against any claims as a 
result of such delay raised by the beneficiaries of such payments, under the terms set out in 
section 5.2.2 below. 
The Paying Agent shall communicate to the Management Company by email, before 13:00 
CET of any Interest Determination Date, the Interest Rate applicable to the Floating Rate 
Notes including the supporting documentation for such calculations in accordance with 
section 4.7.6 of the Securities Note of the Base Prospectus. 
5.2.2. Limitation of liability of the Paying Agent  
The Paying Agent shall not be responsible for any damages caused to the Management 
Company or to the Noteholders, in the performance of their respective duties, provided that 
such damage does not derive directly from acts or omissions attributable to the Paying Agent 
in which they have acted fraudulently or material negligence. 
The Paying Agent will not be liable for losses, damages, costs or expenses as a result of any 
fraudulent act, omission of information, misrepresentation, fraud or negligence or error in 
sending or receiving by the Management Company or refraining from performing any 
instruction, or third parties in relation to the information used by the Paying Agent for the 
exercise of its functions. 
The Management Company undertakes to keep the Paying Agent harmless (as well as its 
directors, officers, agents, employees, companies belonging to its group - with the scope 
provided in article 5 of Legislative Royal Decree 4 / 2015, dated 23rd October , which 


 
 
 
124 
 
approved the consolidated text of the Securities Market Law), for all losses, damages, claims 
and liabilities (including all expenses that could be incurred in connection with investigation, 
preparation or defense of any pending or announced claims or of any action or proceeding 
arising from such claim, or of their appearance as witness) that may arise directly or indirectly 
from the Financial Agency Agreement or its execution, as well as from any breach by the 
Management Company, unless such losses, damages, claims and liabilities are derived from 
directly or through fraudulent or grossly negligent acts or omissions attributable to the Paying 
Agent. 
5.2.3. Resignation by the Paying Agent  
The Paying Agent may, at any time upon not less than two (2) months´ written notice, notify 
the Management Company that it wishes to cease to be the Paying Agent. In addition, the 
resignation may not take place, unless authorized by the Management Company, until the 
twenty (20) day of the month following the month of the Payment Date following the date on 
which the resignation is scheduled. 
Upon receipt of an early termination notice, the Management Company will appoint a new 
Fund’s paying agent (a New Paying Agent) provided that the following conditions are met 
(the Paying Agent Substitution Requirements):  
 
The New Paying Agent: 
(a)

is a credit institution duly authorised to provide banking services in Spain; 
and 
(ii)

the Relevant Rating Agencies shall have been given notice of such substitution and 
(b)
such substitution shall not entail the downgrade or withdrawal of any of the ratings 
then assigned by the Relevant Rating Agencies to the Notes; and 
 
such substitution is made in compliance with the then applicable laws and regulations. 
(c)
The costs and taxes that may be incurred in as a consequence of the resignation of the Paying 
Agent will be on account of the Paying Agent. 
The resignation by the Paying Agent shall not take any effect until the appointment of the 
New Paying Agent is effective. The termination by the Paying Agent of the performance of 
its functions, as well as the appointment of the New Paying Agent will be notified by the 
Management Company to the Relevant Rating Agencies and, if applicable, the CNMV. 
Upon termination of its appointment, the Paying Agent shall deliver to the Management 
Company all documents, monies and securities belonging to the Fund and within its power as 
a result of the duties entrusted hereunder. 


 
 
 
125 
 
5.2.4. Voluntary Substitution  
The Management Company is entitled to substitute the Paying Agent, provided that it notifies 
the Paying Agent in writing at least thirty (30) calendar days in advance of the envisaged 
termination date and provided that the Paying Agent Substitution Requirements are met.  
All costs incurred in the voluntary substitution of the Paying Agent when necessary by 
decision of the Management Company will be for the account of the Fund.  
The substitution of the Paying Agent shall not take any effect until the appointment of the 
New Paying Agent is effective. The termination by the Paying Agent of the performance of 
its functions, as well as the appointment of the New Paying Agent will be notified by the 
Management Company to the Relevant Rating Agencies and, if applicable, the CNMV. 
5.2.5. Mandatory Substitution: Paying Agent Termination Events 
Notwithstanding above, the Management Company is entitled to replace the Paying Agent at 
any time, provided that (i) it is permitted by current legislation and (ii) it is obtained, if 
necessary, the authorization of the competent authorities. In this sense, the reason for the 
substitution must be material and potentially detrimental to the interests of the Noteholders, 
including, without limitation, the occurrence of a Paying Agent Termination Event. 
Upon the occurrence of any of the events referred to in the paragraph above, the Management 
Company shall appoint a New Paying Agent within thirty (30) calendar days after the

certifies that it is material and prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders; 


 
 
 
126 
 
 
the Paying Agent has failed to comply with any of its material obligations under any

(c)
 
at any time it is or becomes unlawful for the Paying Agent to perform or comply with

For these purposes, Eligible Paying Agent means a depository institution organised under the

In any event, this subcontracting or delegation shall not imply any extra costs or expenses for 
the Fund or the Management Company. Neither of them will assume any additional liability 
as a result of such subcontracting or delegation. 
Any subcontracting will be subject to the prior approval of the CNMV, if legally necessary.

7.5. 
Credit ratings assigned by the Rating Agencies 
7.5.1. Ratings assigned to the Rated Notes 
As described in sections 4.12.2 and 4.12.3 of the Securities Note, the issue of Rated Notes of 
each Notes Series under the Programme on the corresponding Issue Date shall be subject to, 
amongst others: 
 
In case of a Note Series issued on the Fund Incorporation Date, the Class A Notes of 
(a)
the Note Series to be issued are assigned a preliminary rating of “AA (sf)” and “AA+ 
sf” respectively by DBRS and Fitch. 


 
 
 
129 
 
 
In case of a Note Series issued on any Issue Date other than the Fund Incorporation 
(b)
Date: 
(i) 
the Class A Notes of the new Note Series to be issued are assigned a 
preliminary rating of “AA (sf) and “AA+ (sf)” (or are preliminarily assigned 
the then current rating of the outstanding Class A Notes) respectively by 
DBRS and Fitch and/or the equivalent ratings from the other Relevant Rating 
Agencies provided (i) always that the Class A Notes shall be rated at least by 
two of the Relevant Rating Agencies and (ii) the issuance of the Class A 
Notes does not result in the downgrade or withdrawal by the Relevant Rating 
Agencies of the then current rating of outstanding Class A Notes; 
(ii) 
as applicable, (i) the Class B Notes of the new Note Series to be issued (as 
the case may be) are rated at least by two of the Relevant Rating Agencies 
and (ii) if any Class B Notes are outstanding, (a) the Class B Notes of the 
new Note Series are assigned preliminarily at least the then current rating of 
the outstanding Class B Notes by the Relevant Rating Agencies and (b) the 
issuance of the Class B Notes of the new Note Series does not result in the 
downgrade or withdrawal by the Relevant Rating Agencies of the then 
current rating of the outstanding Class B Notes. 
The Class A Notes and the Class B Notes (if any) of any Note Series shall always be Rated 
Notes.  
It is not obligatory that the Class C Notes are Rated Notes. That said, if the Class C Notes of 
any Note Series are Rated Notes, the Class C Notes of such Note Series shall be rated at least 
by one of the Relevant Rating Agencies. 
The preliminary ratings assigned to the Rated Notes of each Notes Series shall be specified in 
the applicable Issuing Document and must be confirmed by the Relevant Rating before or 
during the Subscription Date of each Rated Notes.  
In accordance with section 4.4.7.1 of the Registration Document, failure to obtain 
confirmation from the Relevant Rating Agencies of the preliminary ratings initially assigned 
(or if such ratings are withdrawn) before or during the Subscription Date shall entail the 
termination of the issue of the Notes Series in question.  
For these purposes:  
Relevant Rating Agencies means the Rating Agencies specified in the applicable Issuing 
Document in respect of any Class of Notes of any Note Series outstanding at such time. 
Rating Agency means any rating agency between DBRS, Fitch or any other rating agency 
registered and authorized by ESMA. 


 
 
 
130 
 
7.5.2. Considerations regarding the rating assigned to the Notes by the Rating 
Agencies 
The meaning of the ratings assigned to the Rated Notes can be consulted in the web pages of 
the Relevant Rating Agencies. 
The ratings assigned by the Rating Agencies do not constitute an evaluation of the likelihood 
of the Borrowers repaying the Receivables early, or of the extent to which such early 
repayments differ from those originally estimated. In no way do the ratings represent a rating 
of the level of actuarial yield. 
The assigned ratings, as well as any revision or suspension thereof: 
 
are formulated by the Rating Agencies on the basis of varied information received, 
(a)
the accuracy and completeness of which is not guaranteed by the Rating Agencies, 
and therefore the Rating Agencies will in no event be held liable for the contents 
thereof; and 
 
do not constitute and, therefore, could not in any way be interpreted as an invitation, 
(b)
recommendation or solicitation for investors to proceed to carry out any type of 
transaction with the Rated Notes and, in particular, to acquire, retain, encumber or sell 
such Rated Notes. The final ratings of a Class of Notes may be revised, suspended or 
withdrawn at any time by the Rating Agencies, depending on any information that 
comes to their knowledge. Such situations will be notified immediately both to the 
CNMV and the Noteholders of the Rated Notes. 
To perform the rating and monitoring process, the Rating Agencies rely on the accuracy and 
completeness of the information that they are given by the Seller, the Management Company, 
the Arrangers, the Auditor and the legal advisors. 
These credit ratings are only an estimate and do not necessarily mean that potential investors 
do not have to conduct their own analysis of the Rated Notes that they intend to buy. 
In accordance with section 4.4.7.1 of the Registration Document, failure to obtain 
confirmation from the Rating Agencies of the preliminary ratings (or if such ratings are 
withdrawn) before or during the Subscription Date shall entail the termination of the issue of 
the Notes Series in question.

ADDITIONAL BUILDING BLOCK TO THE SECURITIES NOTE 
(ANNEX VIII OF COMMISSION REGULATION 809/2004) 
1. SECURITIES 
1.1. 
Minimum denomination of a Notes Series 
Notes of any Note Series will always be issued in a denomination of EUR one hundred 
thousand (€100,000). 
The Maximum Outstanding Balance of the Programme from time to time outstanding under 
the Programme will not exceed EUR 3,000,000,000.  
1.2. 
Confirmation that the information relating to an undertaking or obligor which is not 
involved in the issue has been accurately reproduced 
Not applicable. 
2. UNDERLYING ASSETS 
2.1. 
Confirmation that the securitised assets backing the Notes Series have the capacity to 
produce the funds to service any payments due and payable on the Notes 
The Management Company confirms that the cash flows to be generated by Purchased 
Receivables, according to the contractual terms and conditions of the Credit Card Agreements 
under which they derive, shall permit the payment of all the amounts due and payable in 
relation to the Notes in accordance with the relevant Priority of Payments. However, in order 
to cover for possible payment defaults by the Borrowers and thus enhance its financial 
structure and procure the largest possible coverage for the risks inherent to the Notes Series, 
the Management Company, on behalf of the Fund, will put in place a number of enhancement 
transactions as set out in section 3.4.3 of this Additional Building Block. Likewise, some 
Notes Series may have Hedging Agreements according to the provisions of the relevant 
Issuing Document of the corresponding Notes Series. 
The Notes have different risk of failing to receive payments as and when due and therefore 
the Notes may have different credit ratings assigned by the Relevant Rating Agencies 
described in section 7.5 of the Securities Note. 
Upon occurrence of any of the circumstances listed in section 4.4.3 of the Registration 
Document, the Management Company may proceed with the Early Liquidation of the Fund 
on the terms described in section 4.4.3 of the Registration Document.  


 
 
 
132 
 
The Management Company confirms the above on the basis of (i) the representations and 
warranties made by the Seller with respect to the Credit Card Agreements and the 
Receivables listed in section 2.2.8 of the Additional Building Block; (ii) the report prepared 
by KPMG on the Audited Portfolio; (iii) the Initial Note Series Issuance Conditions 
Precedent set out in section 4.12.1. of the Securities Note and the Further Note Series 
Issuance Conditions Precedent required as per section 4.12.1 of the Securities Note and (iv) 
the ratings assigned to the Rated Notes by the Relevant Rating Agencies as described in 
section 7.5 of the Securities Note. 
2.2. 
Assets backing the Notes Series 
The Receivables to be transferred to the Fund on the Fund Incorporation Date and thereafter 
on each Purchase Date during the life of the Fund are credit card receivables arising from 
drawings made by the Borrowers under the revolving credit facilities granted to such 
Borrowers by the Seller under the terms of the Credit Card Agreements. The Credit Cards 
Agreements from which the Receivables comprising the Audited Portfolio arise all have the 
same contractual conditions.  
The incorporation of future Eligible Receivables will be done through the transfer of Initial 
Transfers and Additional Transfers as detailed in section 3.3 of the Additional Building 
Block. 
The credit facilities made available under the Credit Card Agreements are of a revolving 
nature, meaning that any principal repayment will reconstitute the credit available to the 
Borrower and may be re-drawn by the Borrower. The maximum amount of the credit which 
can be drawn by any Borrower (the Credit Limit) is set out in the relevant Credit Card 
Agreement and may be increased or decreased by the Seller in accordance with and subject to 
the limitations set out in its Credit Policies. 
 
Credit Cards are lines of credit through which Borrowers are entitled to freely use the 
amounts they consider appropriate up to the credit limit established in the agreement, and are 
obliged to pay their balance and corresponding interest, periodically. 
 
As of 16 June 2017, the Eligible Portfolio included 399,076 Credit Cards issued by WiZink 
Bank, S.A. to private individuals in accordance with the entity’s internal criteria, described in 
section 2.2.7 of the Additional Building Block. At the date of reference, the Credit Cards had 
an Outstanding Principal Balance of 605,921,870.57 Euros. The Aggregate Credit Limit of 
the Eligible Portfolio on that date was 1,551,915,604Euros. 
 


 
 
 
133 
 
All Credit Card Agreements from which the Receivables included in the Audited Portfolio 
arise have been granted to Borrowers which are individuals resident in Spain as of the signing 
date of the corresponding Credit Card Agreement. 
 
For these purposes, Borrower means, in relation to any Credit Card Agreement, the 
individual who has entered into such Credit Card Agreement as principal obligor to the Seller. 
Main cardholder and authorised users 
Credit Card Agreements are signed with a main cardholder, who is the Borrower of the 
revolving credit facility granted under each Credit Card Agreement. Additional (physical) 
credit cards may be issued by the Seller to authorised users linked to the same Credit Card 
Agreement. Credit analysis is performed by the Seller in respect of the Borrower only (and 
not on additional authorised users). 
Drawings under the Credit Card Agreements 
 
In connection with each Credit Card Agreement, a (physical) credit card is always delivered 
to the Borrower by the Seller (a Credit Card). Each physical card is valid for a period of 36 
months. Once this period expires, if the associated credit facility continues to meet all the 
criteria for its renewal, a new valid physical card is issued for a further period of 36 months. 
The revolving credit facility made available by the Seller to the Borrower under a Credit Card 
Agreement is used by the Borrower: 
 
by making use of the Credit Card to: 
(a)
(i) 
pay the price for the goods or services acquired,  
(ii) 
withdraw cash in automated teller machines (ATMs) or cash 
withdrawal systems which permit these services; or  
 
to receive transfers of funds in the relevant account of the Borrower by means 
(b)
of phone or internet request whenever this possibility is offered by the Seller 
(LOPs or instant cash transferred to the customer account up to 90% of 
available line, and ALOPs or temporary increase of the credit line with a fix 
monthly payment added to Outstanding Principal Balance).  
 


 
 
 
134 
 
For clarification purposes, the Borrower must satisfy certain criteria to access to an ALOP. 
Currently these include the time that has elapsed from the approval of the Credit Card, the age 
and residence of the Borrower, the performance of the Credit Card and the behavior score. 
Subject to the satisfaction of the criteria mentioned above, all the Borrowers of the eligible 
portfolio could access to an ALOP. 
Moreover, as further explained below (see section entitled “Interest and charges”), the Seller 
may charge fees to the Borrower (fees may be charged, amongst others, for cash withdrawals, 
non-payment and wire transfers to the Borrower's account).  
Fees charged to the Borrower amount to Drawings for all purposes and, therefore, they 
increase the Outstanding Principal Balance of the relevant Credit Card Agreement, accrue 
interest at the interest rate then applicable to the Drawings and are repaid in Instalments. 
 By way of exception to the foregoing, late payment fees are added to the relevant Minimum 
Due (as defined below in section "Amortisation of Outstanding Balance") instead of being 
added to the Outstanding Principal Balance of the Credit Cards. Therefore, payment is sought 
in full at the end of the relevant Monthly Billing Period. In any case, and following the 
general rule, non-payment of the Minimum Due will consolidate as part of the Outstanding 
Principal Balance of the Credit Cards as the rest of fees.  
Moreover, as further explained in section below entitled “Type of Repayment Options”, 
Credit Card Agreements allow for two main repayment options, either (i) in a single interest-
free repayment or (ii) in interest-bearing instalments. Where a single interest-free instalment 
is unpaid by the Borrower, the Seller may finance payment thereof by means of a Drawing 
under the Credit Card Agreement. 
Consequently, any drawdowns made by the Borrower (or any other authorized user) under the 
revolving credit facility granted under each Credit Card Agreement, and which includes (i) 
any fees financed by the Seller (other than the late payment fee, unless it is unpaid), (ii) any 
insurance premium under the optional Insurance Policy entered by the Borrower financed by 
the Seller and (iii) any unpaid single interest-free instalment financed by the shall be 
considered a Drawing.  
Drawings under the Credit Card Agreement are accounted for in monthly billing periods or 
payment cycles (the Monthly Billing Period) which do not coincide with calendar months.  


 
 
 
135 
 
The outstanding balance of a Credit Card Agreement is defined as the outstanding balance of 
the credit facility as reflected in the corresponding Credit Card Agreement at any given time. 
The Outstanding Principal Balance on any specific date (the Outstanding Principal 
Balance) is defined as the balance that is owed at any given moment from the line of credit 
linked to such credit card. On a specific date, the Outstanding Balance is the result of the sum 
of (i) the Outstanding Balance of such Card at the closing of the immediately prior billing 
period, plus (ii) the sum of any use made with the credit card (the Drawings) made since the 
closing of such period, minus (iii) payments made since the last billing period. 
Type of repayment options 
Credit Card Agreements allow for two main repayment options, either (i) in a single interest-
free repayment (Transactor) or (ii) in interest-bearing instalments (Revolver). The choice of 
the repayment option is made by the Borrower at the time of entering into the Credit Card 
Agreement but may be changed afterwards at its election. In this regards, a Borrower that has 
used the single interest-free repayment option can turn into an interest-bearing payment by the 
simple act of changing its repayment model. 
Type of Credit Cards 
In connection with each Credit Card Agreement, a (physical) Credit Card is always delivered 
to the Borrower by the Seller. For information purposes, the Seller currently issues four (4) 
types of Credit Cards. 
 
These different types of credit cards (Visa Classic, Visa Oro -Gold-...); do not alter the 
underlying credit conditions or the Borrowers. Credit lines associated to the Credit Cards of 
the Eligible Portfolio share the same contractual conditions. In this sense, changes in the type 
of card of a Credit Card (for example, upgrade from Visa Classic to Visa Gold) do not alter 
the contractual conditions of the line of credit from which it is derived but they have 
additional advantages such as greater insurance coverage, travel assistance, the ability to 
redeem benefits for gasoline or/and discounts programs. Contractual conditions are covered in 
the Credit Card Agreement. 
Credit limits 
Each Card has a Credit Limit, defined as the maximum amount that the Borrower can 
use/withdraw from the card. By aggregation, the Aggregate Credit Limit is the sum of the 
Credit Limits of all the Credit Cards.  


 
 
 
136 
 
Credit Limits are set by the Seller in accordance with its Credit Policies. Among the factors 
considered for setting the initial Credit Limit are the Borrower's age, level of income, the 
number of years employed, his/her marital status, etc. The usual initial Credit Limit varies 
between EUR 600 and EUR 6,000.  
Credit Limits assigned to each Borrower are reviewed monthly by the Seller on the basis of 
the performance of the Borrower and may be revised (upwards or downwards) accordingly. 
Borrowers can reject a limit increase. New limits (which are duly notified to the Borrowers 
but which do not imply the signing of a new Credit Card Agreement) come into force in the 
Monthly Billing Period following the one in which the Borrower has been notified by the 
Seller of the change. Borrowers can also request a reduction or increase of the limit. Any 
request by the Borrower to increase the Credit Limit must be approved by the Seller. When 
the Borrower requests credit limit increases, specific analysis is required, assessing the new 
risk profile of the Borrower based on a series of parameters defined by the Seller’s scoring 
system. Furthermore, the Seller can also reduce the credit limit upon request from the 
Borrower. 
The positive difference between the Credit Limit on each Credit Card Agreement and its 
Outstanding Principal Balance at any given time is defined as the Available Balance (Saldo 
Disponible) of the Credit Card Agreement. 
 
Nevertheless, Wizink may temporarily allow to a Credit Card client to have an outstanding 
balance in excess of the Credit Limit initially established by the Seller; this is treated as Over 
Credit Limits (OCLs). Currently, the Seller only approves OCL to Cards holders with a 
minimum seasonality of 6 months, a favorable observed Borrower behavior score and no 
negative Borrower credit information at any credit institution. The maximum Over Credit 
Limit must not exceed 30% of the Card’s Credit Limit. 
 
The temporarily increases of the Credit Limit does not result in interest rates increases. 
 
Interest and charges 
 
Credit Cards accrue regular interest depending on their contractual conditions established in 
their corresponding agreements. For each billing period, interest is calculated in relation to the 
Outstanding Principal Balance that exists at the end of each corresponding billing period. 
Single interest-free instalments and insurance premia of Insurance Policies entered into after 


 
 
 
137 
 
July 2011 do not accrue interest. 97.58% of the cards accrue an interest rate of 24% that it is 
the contractual nominal rate. The average contractual nominal rate of the Eligible Portfolio is 
23.93%, as is included in the tables in this section. 
 
The weighted average TAE (including fees) of the Credit Cards is equal to 27.16%. The 
weighted average TEDR of the Credit Cards with data as of May 2017 is equal to 22.55%. 
 
 Nevertheless, under certain circumstances, uniquely and temporarily and as part of specific 
marketing campaigns, the Seller may offer reduced interest rate financing for certain 
purchases during a limited period of time. 
 
The applicable interest rate for Over Credit Limit balances and those that are in default will 
be the one applied to the remainder of the outstanding balance at the time credit moves over 
the limit or enters in default. Over Credit Limits or default fees are also applicable. 
Unpaid Drawings and overdrafts do not accrue default interest but unpaid interest is 
capitalised and accrues further ordinary interest. However, the Seller may charge a fee for 
claiming unpaid amounts provided it undertakes actual collection actions aimed at collecting 
such unpaid amounts.  
The interest rate is contractually agreed between the Seller and the Borrower in the Credit 
Card Agreement. The interest rate can be adjusted by the Seller providing a two (2) month 
prior written notice to the Borrowers. Each Borrower is entitled to refuse such adjustment, in 
which case (i) the interest rate applicable will be the interest rate applicable prior to the 
proposed adjustment, (ii) the Borrower will not be entitled to make any further Drawings 
under the relevant Credit Card Agreement and (iii) the Borrower will continue to repay all 
outstanding Drawings made under the relevant Credit Card Agreement in accordance with the 
conditions of the Credit Card Agreement as in force prior to the proposed adjustment. 
Pursuant to the Credit Card Agreement the Seller may charge fees to the Borrower for, 
amongst others, cash withdrawals, non-payment (as described above), wire transfers to the 
Borrower's account, Over Credit Limit fees, charges for issuing card duplicates, SMS alerts, 
etc. These charges are included in the Credit Card Agreements signed by each Borrower and 
WiZink. As indicated above, payment of these fees (other than the late payment fee, unless it 
is unpaid) is financed by the Seller under the Credit Card Agreement in the same manner as 
with any other Drawings. Accordingly, fees (other than the late payment fee, unless it is 
unpaid) increase the Outstanding Principal Balance of each Credit Card Agreement and 


 
 
 
138 
 
accrue interest. Therefore, these financed fees will be included within the principal collections 
transferred by the Servicer to the Fund. 
 
Credit Card charges are part of the rights transferred to the Fund through the sale of the 
Receivables under the terms described in section 3.3 of the Additional Building Block. 
 
Amortisation of Outstanding Balances 
Cards have an established minimum monthly amortization amount for all Borrowers (the 
Minimum Due). The current Minimum Due applied to each billing period is the sum of (i) 
0.5% of the Outstanding balance; (ii) interest of the corresponding billing period; (iii) 
Minimum Due from the previous billing period if outstanding; (iv) (if any) any fix installment 
linked to the different model of use of the cards (EPP, LOPs, and ALOPs) and (v) charges and 
other items that correspond in accordance with the credit card agreement. This Minimum Due 
can never be less than 18 Euros plus any fix installment depending on the model of use of the 
card. The maximum amortization period for ALOPs, LOPs and EPPs is 60 months. 
The Borrowers may modify specific monthly amortization conditions for the Outstanding 
Principal Balance of each Credit Card. Under the terms and conditions of the Credit Card 
agreements, each Borrower can choose the amortization amount of the Outstanding Principal 
Balance, both in terms of the percentage of the debt or fixed amounts, at the closing of the 
billing period or cycle assuming the Minimum Due established above. 
Charge and Collections Account 
Every Credit Card Agreement is associated with a bank account (the Charge Accounts) 
where the Seller debits the amounts payable under the Credit Card Agreement on a monthly 
basis by means of direct debit. Charge Accounts are current accounts opened at Spanish 
financial institutions in the Borrower's name (the Charge Account Banks). On a monthly 
basis (following the end of each Monthly Billing Period), the Seller instructs its Collections 
Account Bank to collect the relevant Receivables by direct debit and, to that end, it remits all 
relevant Receivables' data to such Collections Account Bank for them to collect the amounts 
due thereunder by direct debit.  
The Collections Account Bank credits the amount of each batch of Receivables remitted to it 
for collection by the Seller into the account in the name of the Seller held by such Collections 
Account Bank (the Collections Account).  


 
 
 
139 
 
The Collections Account will be used exclusively in connection with the amounts to be 
collected under the Purchased Receivables. 
In accordance with section 3.7.2.7 of the Additional Building Block, WIZINK (as Servicer) 
has the obligation to grant an in rem right of pledge in favour of the Fund over the Collections 
Account. Please see section 3.4.3.9 for additional information on this security granted over 
the Collections Account. 
 
Although all Credit Cards have a corresponding collection account, Borrowers can 
exceptionally also use other methods of payment like post transfers, bank checks, internet 
transfers. 
Notwithstanding the scheduled monthly repayments, the Borrower may prepay all or part of 
the Drawings made under a Credit Card Agreement at any time. 
 
Returns and refunds 
Credit Card Borrowers may return a purchase made with the card (by returning the product 
purchased or if the good or service purchased was not received), in which case the retailer 
reimburses the amount of the purchase to WiZink who then reimburses the relevant amount to 
the customer. Returns imply a readjustment of the Outstanding Balance of the Borrower; 
therefore, the Borrower is automatically entitled to re-use the card for such amount. 
 
Insurance 
The Credit Card Agreements offer the Borrower the option of taking out insurance to cover 
the risk of the Borrower's death, temporary or permanent incapacity, unemployment or 
hospitalisation (the Insurance Policies). Entering into an Insurance Policy is entirely 
voluntary, at the Borrower's request, and operates by means of the payment of a monthly 
premium calculated as a percentage of the Outstanding Principal Balance of the Credit Card 
Agreement for the relevant month.  
Where the Seller is designated as beneficiary of the Insurance Indemnification, such payments 
will form part of the rights conferred upon the Fund. 
Approximately the 24% of the total portfolio of the bank is covered by an insurance “Credit 
Shield”. 
 


 
 
 
140 
 
For these purposes: 
Insurance Indemnifications means any amounts payable to the Seller under any Insurance 
Policies entered into by the relevant Borrower in connection with any Credit Card Agreement. 
Insurance Policies means the optional insurance policies entered into by the Borrowers in 
connection with any Credit Card Agreement in respect of which the Seller has been, and 
remains, designated as “beneficiary”. 
 
As described in section 2.2.10 of the Additional Building Block, insurance policies are 
arranged with METLIFE and the Outstanding Balance of the Credit Cards insured at date 16 
June 2017 was 113,406,613.75 Euros, that it represents a percentage equal to 18.72% of the 
total Outstanding Principal Balance of the Credit Cards 
 
Cards 
Actual Credit Cards are issued in accordance with current market standards. Each plastic card 
is issued with period of validity of 36 months. Once the card has expired, if the associated line 
of credit again meets all the criteria for renewal, a new plastic card is issued for another 36 
months. 
 
Guarantees 
The Receivables do not benefit from any personal guarantee or security securing payment 
thereof. However, the Borrower as main cardholder is jointly and severally liable for the debt 
of any authorised users of Credit Cards provided under the same Credit Card Agreement.  
2.2.1. Legal jurisdiction by which the pool of assets is governed 
The assets to be securitised will be governed by Spanish law. 
2.2.2. General characteristics of the Receivables, as well as global statistical data 
referred to the securitised assets 
On the Fund Incorporation Date, the Fund will purchase Eligible Receivables deriving from 
the Credit Card Agreements included initially in the Audited Portfolio.  
The Receivables to be transferred by the Seller to the Fund on the Fund Incorporation Date 
shall consist of a random selection by the Seller of Eligible Receivables of the Audited 
Portfolio.  


 
 
 
141 
 
The characteristics of the Purchased Receivables on the Fund Incorporation Date may differ 
from the Audited Portfolio due to inter alia prepayments, delinquencies, and defaults and 
from the fact the amount of Eligible Receivables that the Fund will purchase will be less than 
the amount of Eligible Receivables of the the Audited Portfolio. 
As of 16 June 2017, the Eligible Receivables of the Audited Portfolio represents a percentage 
equal to 18.07% of the total portfolio amount potentially eligible for the Programme.

2.2.4. Expiry or maturity date of the assets 
The Credit Card Agreements are entered into for an indefinite period of time, notwithstanding 
that the Credit Card Agreement may be cancelled in the terms described therein, which are 
summarised below. 
A Borrower may terminate the Credit Card Agreement at any time, subject to giving fifteen 
(15) days prior notice and repaying the outstanding debt. The Seller may terminate the Credit 
Card Agreement at any time, subject to giving two (2) months' prior notice. In either case, the 
Borrower cannot make new Drawings under the Credit Card Agreement and the Borrower 
will continue to repay all outstanding Drawings made under the relevant Credit Card 
Agreement in accordance with the conditions of the Credit Card Agreement in force upon at 
the time of such termination. 
As a general rule, the Seller may also terminate the Credit Card Agreement without the need 
of giving any prior notice, in the event of (i) a deterioration of the Borrower's solvency, (ii) a 
material breach by the Borrower of its obligations under the Credit Card Agreement or any 
other product or service of the Seller, (iii) the provision of inaccurate or false data, (iv) the 
lack of use of the Card for a period exceeding twelve (12) months, (v) when the use of the 
Credit Card could lead to a significant increase in the risk that the Borrower may be unable to 
meet his/her payment obligation, (vi) an abusive or fraudulent use of the Credit Card, or (vii) 
when the Borrower has exceeded the Credit Limit by an amount equivalent to 140% thereof. 
In these cases, the relevant Borrower must immediately repay in full the outstanding debt 
(including accrued interests) under the Credit Card Agreement. 


 
 
 
150 
 
Despite the indefinite duration of the Credit Card Agreement, each Credit Card has a set 
expiry date, printed thereon and cannot be used after the indicated date. Prior to the Credit 
Card's expiry, the Seller issues a replacement Credit Card. 
2.2.5. Amount of the assets 
The aggregate amount of the Outstanding Principal Balance of the Receivables transferred to 
the Fund on the Fund Incorporation Date will be a figure equal, or (failing that) as close as 
possible, to EUR 550,000,000. 
At any given time, the Outstanding Principal Balance of the Receivables transferred to the 
Fund during the life of the Fund shall not exceed EUR 4,000,000,000 (the Maximum 
Portfolio Amount).  
The Management Company and the Seller may elect to modify such Maximum Portfolio 
Amount pursuant to an amendment to the Deed of Incorporation in the terms set out in article 
24 of Law 5/2015 and through the issue of the relevant Prospectus Supplement (unless such 
modification coincides with a renewal of the Base Prospectus). 
2.2.6. Loan to value ratio or level of collateralization 
Not applicable.  
2.2.7. Asset creation method 
Introduction 
Wizink Bank, S.A. credit card business is inherited from former Wizink S.A and more 
recently from bancopopular-e.com.  
 
Wizink Bank, S.A. is a fully regulated independent bank under supervision of Bank of Spain 
and the European Central Bank.  
 
Wizink Bank S.A. credit card business started back in 1992 and currently has more than 2.5 
million customers in the Spanish Market.  
 
Its position in the market has been achieved thanks to a specialist business model based on the 
establishment of its line of business with independence from other banking products and to 
mark a difference with its competitors. The main differences are the independence of the 
business, the focus on credit cards as financing methods and the use of direct sale channels as 
distribution, among others.

Credit risk management  
 
a) Credit Risk Governance 
As a fully regulated and supervised bank operating in the EU, Wizink has a strong risk 
governance framework based on the regulator requirements and best market practices. The 
bank has established the typical 3 lines of defense (risk management; risk monitoring and 
Internal audit) structure to independently define, manage, monitor and control risk levels. 
Additionally, the bank internal RAF (risk appetite framework) includes a specific section 
related to Credit Risk in which metrics and Key Performance Identificator (KPIs) are defined 
and monitored. Furthermore, the bank submits to the ECB its internal assessment of capital 
(ICAAP) in which a thorough analysis of capital adequacy of the bank is made in connection 
to the risk (including credit) that the bank is facing. In this exercise, stress tests are carried 
related to the performance of the credit card portfolio in order to validate adequacy of current 
levels of capital with the regulator. Both, RAF and ICAAP are approved at Board of Directors 
which assumes maximum responsibility in front of the regulator. These are reported to the 
ECB on an annual basis. 
 
From this point, credit risk management is embedded across the entire bank operational 
structure being the departments more closely involved Credit Department (Credit policies, 
Collections Strategies, Collections, Credit Initiation and Fraud) and Strategic Decision and 
Analysis (as responsible for the scoring model). 
 
b) Operational structure 
Wizink credit risk in managed through its Credit Risk Department that is divided in the 
following areas: 
- 
Credit Policy (19 FTE): it role is to define Cards risk policy for both new acquisition 
and portfolio management with the aim of profitable growing, ensuring risk quality. 
- 
Collection Strategy (7 FTE): responsible to define the adequate Collections Policies 
and Strategy since the first direct debit bounced until write-off. 
- 
Fraud (16 FTE): with the objective to reduce fraud losses to a level compatible with 
both the needs of our customers and product profitability.  
- 
Credit Initiation (42 FTE): it manages the credit underwriting process in a centralized 
way.  
- 
Collections Group which is divided in in-house collections (178 FTEs), Outsourced 
Collections (32 FTEs) and Collections administration (38 FTE). 


 
 
 
152 
 
Together with the Credit Risk Director, total credit risk team is made of 332 professionals 
directly involved in risk management of the credit cards portfolio.  
 
Additionally, as part of the bank´s Strategic planning and decisions department, Wizink has a 
specific team devoted to the development, control, update and calibration of its scoring and 
internal models. 
 
c) Scoring models 
Internal proprietary scoring models is one of the key elements in Wizink´s credit card 
approval process. The use of these models is essential to approve customers and to assign the 
initial credit limits and to eventually update them. The current model has been already 
operational for over 6 years.  
 
The results of the model are based on the assessment of economic and demographic variables. 
Among the most significant variables are those that define the profile of the customer, such as 
age, marital status, gender, address, employment situation, time in employment and level of 
income. Each variable has a specific weight and the final score obtained the Borrower is 
classified in levels of risk: low, medium, medium-high and high. There are minimum scores 
that automatically prevent the approval of a credit line. Similarly, there is a limit in the 
number of Borrowers that can reach a high level of risk. 
 
The initial credit limit granted to a credit card depends mainly on sales channel, the type of 
employment, the level of income and the level of scoring obtained. 
 
Scoring results are monitored on a monthly basis so it is  an essential tool in risk control. 
Additionally, there is a quarterly review in which the performance of the model is assessed in 
order to re-calibrate based on behavior of the clients. The model is recalibrated by contrasting 
the default rates observed in the portfolio and the statistical significance of the different 
variables established and the correlation between such variables and the degree of hits 
obtained.  
 
Credit limit monitoring and update is also carried out through by credit department based on 
score results. In this analysis, the key variables are those relative to the historical behavior of 
the Borrower such as: average and final balance, balance variability, vintage of the card, 
degree of relationship with the customer, average payment rate, times running OCLs or in 


 
 
 
153 
 
default, use of card per type of transaction (purchases or cash withdrawals, EPPs which 
means the conversion of a single purchase or a portion of the balance into fixed instalments, 
etc…) and frequency. 
 
In this sense, to increase credit limits, a low or very low risk rating is required, and the 
amount of increase granted is related to the use and current limit of the card. 
 
Approval process and assignation of credit limits 
 
a) Acquiring new customers: sales channels. 
Wizink has established a model to acquire new customers using a number of channels, mainly 
with a direct sales approach. A team of 38 people that work in the acquisitions area manages 
these acquisition channels. This area controls the relationship with the 9 direct sale agencies 
that Wizink has authorized with a network of more than 900 sales representatives. 
 
Wizink maintains a comprehensive control policy, both in selection and in the relationship 
between the agencies and their sales representatives, who carry out: 
• 
Extensive verification of the company prior to selection. 
• 
Initial and periodical training courses. 
• 
Onsite quality controls (mystery shopper) and monthly and quarterly surveys to 
customers. 
• 
Management and monitoring of risk indicators. 
• 
Management and monitoring of recoveries. 
• 
Annual revision programs. 
• 
Internal control tests to verify they meet WiZink criteria 
• 
Periodical internal audits. 
 
The main channels used to acquire new customers, in terms of new accounts (2016 FY) are:  
• 
Telesales: 39.13%. 
• 
Stands in shopping centers, airports and train stations: 32.17% 
• 
Partnerships (CEPSA model): 22.17%. 
• 
Internet and Others: 6.52% 
 
It is worth to note that Wizink has no branches and does not originate Eligible Credit Cards 
through Banco Popular branches. The Fund will not purchase Receivables originated by 
Banco Popular. 
 
 
 


 
 
 
154 
 
b) Approval process 
Once the customer is acquired but prior to the approval, a risk analysis is carried out. Wizink 
evaluation and approval guidelines are included in their local and corporate policies. 
 
Furthermore, the entire decision-making process (distribution, issue, risk management, 
portfolio management, services and recoveries) is based on a fundamentally analytical and 
disciplined perspective. Any exception that is not included in its procedures must be 
documented for approval and monitoring by the executive management of the bank. 
 
The evaluation and approval procedure follows the same guidelines for all customers, 
although in some aspects, like data verification, there might be variations depending on the 
channel through which the customer was acquired. 
 
New acquisitions are primarily driven by new-to-bank customers through a new, flexible and 
robust application system (Power Curve by Experian) with decision rule engine and process 
flow that can be quickly designed and deployed in order to deal with high volumes and take 
automatic decision.  
 
Additionally, Power Curve has built-in functionalities that allow us to use multiple scores, to 
combine all applications and internal variables in order to take automatic decisions, to 
connect on line with external interfaces and create champion challenger strategies 
 
The credit card issue approval phases are the following: 
 
I. Introducing data into the system: 
Two external data acquisition companies contracted by Wizink carry out this task. The 
agencies acquiring customers email all application forms so that they can be introduced to the 
bank’s database. Wizink’s credit initiation unit carries out daily checks of the applications 
introduced, data quality and that the paper application form has been delivered to Wizink. 
 
Applications must include the necessary documentation to proceed to the correct 
identification of the customer and to carry out the risk analysis. Currently, the following is 
required: (i) photocopy of ID card or VAT ID number, (ii) application form signed by the 
customer (iii) express authorization to check data at the Social Security Treasury (TGSS, in 
Spanish) and at Asnef Equifax / Experian. 


 
 
 
155 
 
 
II. Social Security verification and internal control: 
At the TGSS, Wizink verifies that all customer applications received are included in its 
database in order to comply with current legislation to prevent money laundering, verifying 
the information relative to economic activity (type of employment, name of the employer and 
Standard Industrial Code of the employer). 
 
At the same time, all new applications are crosschecked against the existing card database to 
identify existing customers and review all the information including the customer’s payment 
history. Depending on the response and based on the results of the verifications at internal 
databases, the application can be automatically rejected or moved along the approval process. 
 
III. Minimum approval criteria: 
In the next phase, each application is examined to verify that it meets the minimum criteria 
established for each acquisition channel. 
 
All Borrowers must satisfy certain minimum economic and demographic characteristics to 
obtain a credit line. These characteristics can vary in relation to the type of card and the 
employment status of the customer (employed or self-employed). Some of the minimum 
criteria are: 
o Minimum age for all types of cards: 22 
o Maximum age: 70 
o Minimum salary between 5,000 – 10,000€ (gross annual income) for all cards 
o Employment situation: employed, temporary workers and self-employed, with a 
minimum employment period and retired (some exceptions according to income). 
 
IV. Scoring 
Once minimum approval criteria are verified, applications enter into a scoring process. 
Currently the bank has separated score models based on channel: Telesales, Partner and 
Multi-Channel (Transports, Commercial Centers, Internet). 
 
V. Bureau Checks and other verifications: 
Check with existing negative credit bureaus in Spain: Asnef-Equifax and Experian. Wizink 
carries out this verification directly. 
Additionally, all new applications are automatically crosschecked against the database that 
system keeps with all the apps decided during the last weeks in order to detect potential fraud 


 
 
 
156 
 
cases and against the Special Designated Nationals List, to carry out, amongst others, checks 
related to anti money laundering. 
 
Finally, a sample of applications is verified to confirm that the information provided by 
customer is real, clarify discrepancies detected when comparing data with Social Security info 
and identify potential fraud. This is performed by external agencies specialized in telephone 
verification. 
 
VI. Second Score and Initial line assignment: 
Throughout the approval procedure, and following the described scoring model, Wizink´s 
credit department calculates, at least on two occasions, the scoring and relative level obtained 
by each customer. 
 
This phase is established to guarantee that the credit risk and associated cost of each 
application are covered by future expected income from each application. 
 
Initial line assigned based on channel, product, Score Brand and Income ranging from 500€ to 
6.000€. 
 
VII. Manual revision / automatic approval: 
Application is automatically approved by the system or manually reviewed by certified 
internal credit analyst based on: channel, employment circular, score model, internal customer 
flag and verification flag. 
 
c) Authorisations, approval capacity and credit limit monitoring 
Wizink grants credit analysts with the necessary authority to approve request once they meet 
the following criteria: 
(i) 
Wizink’s credit policy manual training 
(ii) 
A minimum employment in this role of 90 days 
(iii) 
Satisfactory completion of 100 file revisions with the supervisor 
(iv) 
Satisfactory completion of 50 file revisions following the manual 
 
Once these requisites are met, supervisors request this power from risk managers for specific 
analysts. Initially, this power is restricted for limit approvals of 3,000€ and no exceptions. 
An analyst with higher authority must approve requests that imply exceptions.  
 


 
 
 
157 
 
Monitoring credit limits 
The scoring model applied periodically monitors risk depending on the payment behavior of 
the customer, allowing automatic actions on the credit limits of the credit cards. Thus, 
throughout the life of the card it is possible to: 
i. 
Increase the limit: automatically, based on the behaviour of the card. This increase 
can also derive from a specific request from the customer as long as all the previous 
requisites are met. 
ii. 
Reduce the limit: monthly, to reduce the exposure of certain risk groups depending on 
the rating, the type of client and the information obtained from credit bureaus. 
iii. 
Obtain an exceptional Over Credit Limit: the card must be at least 3 months old and 
the customer must not be in any credit bureaus. 
 
There are minimum requirements to increase the limit of the card. Specifically, the card must 
be at least six (6) months old, be active and without defaults, it must not be Over Credit Limit, 
four (4) months must have elapsed since the last limit increase and there must be no negative 
data about the Borrower in any credit institution.  
 
The results of the monthly credit line revision correspond to current criteria coded in the 
Seller's systems (FICO TRIAD). In this way, changes applied to Cards coincide with the 
instruction calculated by the system in accordance with the approved criteria of said policies. 
In the event that the Borrower requests the increase, the analysis must meet all the above 
criteria. 
 
Limit reductions take place to reduce risk exposure. The analysis is based on the Borrowers 
observed behaviour, the type of customer (if there are other additional products) and any 
negative data obtained from credit institutions. 
 
Wizink’s risk policies also include the possibility that the card is blocked or cancelled in the 
event of the deterioration of the solvency of the Borrower, the breach of its obligations or the 
inactivity of the account. 
 
The Credit Scoring department is responsible for the calibration of scoring models, their 
monitoring and the control of the correct application of policies to such models: Statistical 
and Credit Models Development and Management Area, reporting to Wizink's Strategic 


 
 
 
158 
 
decision Department. Separation from Credit risk department is to grant further independence 
on the analysis and separate monitoring. 
 
d) Modification and validity of the approval policies. 
Risk criteria to approve / deny credit cards and their credit limits are updated periodically and 
systematically meet the general economic situation. Likewise, and as has been detailed, credit 
limits for each credit card are revised and updated (if applicable) automatically and 
periodically (monthly and quarterly) depending on the evolution of the Borrower’s risk 
profile. 
 
The approval model based on scoring systems was introduced in 2002 and therefore 100% of 
the Eligible Portfolio is based on the model described in this section. In any event, although 
the approval model applied for any credit card was different, the current credit limits are 
subject to the same monitoring and updating criteria current today and common for the entire 
group of credit cards. 
 
Additionally, every 36 months and based on the operational process for card renewal, 
verification is carried out on each associated line of credit to confirm that it still meets all the 
scoring criteria before the new card, valid for another 36 months, is issued. 
 
Approval and credit limit assignation criteria have been strengthened during the crisis to 
mitigate the deterioration of the credit behavior of the new accounts during the crisis period.  
These actions have been carried out taking into consideration the characteristics of the 
different acquisition channels in relation to the recent behavior of the new accounts and the 
corresponding approval ratios. For instance, approval has been limited in certain provinces in 
certain channels of distribution, average job seniority has been increased, minimum age has 
been increased, minimum scoring requirements have been increased, initial credit limits have 
been modified (reduced) and scorings have been recalibrated. 
 
Collection administration and management 
 
Wizink carries out credit card administration through a team that coordinates the different 
tasks with other departments and with those services that have been subcontracted to third 
parties. Specifically, the functions carried out internally are: customer service, arrears 
recovery, back-office, dispute resolution, development of technological systems and support.  


 
 
 
159 
 
 
Collections Strategy and operational model is supported by robust collections system with 
wide range of functionalities and deep level of data to analysis: flexibility on account 
allocation, strategy implementation and tracking, testing functionality, productivity indicators 
per collector, etc 
 
Currently there are almost 400 collector distributed in-house and outsourced in three different 
agencies. 
 
Administration activities currently subcontracted are: production of plastic cards and PIN 
generation with Oberthur, printing of letters to customers (bills, debit notices, claims...) with 
Emphasis. 
 
Collection model 
Collection strategy is based on 5 pillars: risk segmentation, Intensity, Champion/Challengers 
test, Mitigation tools and external agency management.  
 
Arrears and recovery management 
The management of accounts in arrears is carried out through different channels, combining 
the use of external agencies with the internal capabilities of Wizink. To define the actions and 
intensity of recovery claims, the risk profile of the Borrower is taken into consideration, as is 
the historical behavior that is included in internal scoring models. 
 
The entity has a series of management tools for general collection. The use of these tools 
depends on the degree of severity of the arrear, and the response of the customer: 
o Phone calls: automatic or made by an agent. Periodicity depends on the severity of 
the arrear. 
o Payment claim letters. 
o Certified payment claim letters. 
o Phone messages. 
o Telegrams. 
o External recovery agencies. 
o Legal action. 
 


 
 
 
160 
 
Interaction between internal and external collections teams is basically driven by risk profile 
of the Borrower (low, medium, high or very high) and time in arrears (divided in monthly 
buckets).  
To monitor external agency performance, Wizink has implemented training and monitoring 
strategies together with a Quality Monitoring rating model. 
 
Wizink’s internal team decides the assignation of clients to the different agencies depending 
on the risk profile. Assignation follows a rotational basis and is established depending on 
recovery success criteria. Furthermore, the team defines recovery strategies by structuring 
them in different levels that range from total recovery of arrears, payment plans, mitigation 
efforts and, for extreme default cases, partial condonation in exchange for the immediate 
payment of a specific amount and/or the initiation of legal claims against the Borrower. 
 
The ability to withdraw is automatically blocked by the system the moment a Borrower is in 
arrears. This block is only removed when the customer pays the full amount owed from the 
Credit Card. When the Card is in excess of 90-day arrears, the card is cancelled and the full 
amount owed is requested, except if there is a standing agreement with Wizink. Lack of 
payment of the Minimum Amount agreed in the Credit Card agreement is considered arrears. 
 
The percentage of recovery of the entity is equal to 8.71%. Litigation is conducted for certain 
accounts according to minimum balance, and payment-contact history; process is conducted 
by external agencies specialized in legal proceedings doing also phone collections in search of 
an extrajudicial agreement.

2.2.9. Default of Conformity of the Receivables - Breach of Representations and 
Warranties 
2.2.9.1. 
Breach of Eligibility Criteria and remedies 
 
General Provisions 
(a)
When consenting to acquire the Eligible Receivables on each Purchase Date, the 
Management Company, acting for and on behalf of the Fund, will take into 
consideration, as an essential and determining condition for its consent, the Seller's 
representations and warranties. 
The Management Company will verify the compliance of certain or all of the 
Receivables with part or all of the Eligibility Criteria at the latest on the Selection 
Date with respect to Initial Transfers in an appropriate manner to ensure such 
compliance. No verification shall be made by the Management Company in relation 
to Receivables transferred in the context of Additional Transfers. In any event, the 
responsibility for the non-compliance of the Receivables transferred by the Seller to 
the Fund with the Eligibility Criteria as at the applicable Purchase Date, will at all-
time remain with the Seller only (and the Management Company shall under no 
circumstance be liable therefor) and the Management Company will therefore rely 
only on the representations made, and on the warranties given, by the Seller regarding 
those Purchased Receivables. 
 
Remedies in case of non-compliance 
(b)
If the Management Company or the Seller becomes aware for any reason whatsoever 
that either (i) any of the representations or warranties given or made by the Seller in 
relation to the Purchased Receivables (both in the context of Initial Transfers or 
Additional Transfers) were false or incorrect on the relevant Purchase Date or (ii) one 
or several Eligibility Criteria were not met on the relevant Purchase Date, the 
Management Company or the Seller, as applicable, will promptly inform the other 
party of such non-compliance by providing a letter containing an electronic list with 
the Non-Compliant Receivables.  


 
 
 
168 
 
The Seller undertakes to remedy such non-compliance by repurchasing such Non-
Compliant Receivables, together with, if applicable, any other outstanding Purchased 
Receivables arisen from the same Credit Card Agreement so that the total balance 
under the relevant Credit Card Agreement is repurchased, under the following 
conditions: 
(i) 
the repurchase shall be made on any Repurchase Date prior to the second 
Cut-Off Date following the date on which the non-compliance of that Non-
Compliant Receivable was notified by a party to the other party (with 
economic effects between the Seller and the Fund from the relevant Effective 
Repurchase Date, from which the Seller shall be entitled to any amounts of 
principal, interest, fees , default interest (if applicable), penalties, Insurance 
Indemnifications and any other related payments received from the 
corresponding Repurchased Receivables as of the relevant Repurchase Date). 
(ii) 
The amount payable by the Seller (Non-Compliant Repurchase Amount) 
will be equal to: 
(A) 
the then aggregate Outstanding Principal Balance of each Non-
Compliant Receivable and any other outstanding Purchased 
Receivables arisen from the same Credit Card Agreement; plus  
(B) 
any accrued and unpaid outstanding interest thereon until (but 
excluding) the Effective Repurchase Date, 
as of such Effective Repurchase Date. Payment will be effected on the 
immediately following Calculation Date.  
In order to achieve certainty of the date of the retransfer of the Non-Compliant 
Receivables for the purposes of article 1,526 of the Civil Code, on a monthly basis (if 
applicable) the Management Company will electronically forward to the CNMV the 
data file regarding the repurchased Receivables using the CIFRADOC/CNMV 
service. They will be reported in the CIFRADOC with negative sign. 
Notwithstanding the above, if at any time and for any reason, the Management 
Company is unable to use the CIFRADOC/CNMV service, the Seller and the 
Management Company will appear before the Spanish Notary designated by the 
Seller for the purposes of raising to the status of a Spanish Public Document any 
repurchase of Receivables made hereunder (provided that all cost and expenses 
arising from any such notarisations shall be borne by the Seller).  
If the Seller is unable to repurchase according to the above, the Fund will keep 
ownership of the relevant Non-Compliant Receivables and any other Purchased 
Receivables arising from such Non-Compliant Credit Cards, and the Seller shall 
indemnify the Fund in an amount equal to the Non-Compliant Repurchase Amount 
on the applicable Calculation Date. 


 
 
 
169 
 
Any Non-Compliant Repurchase Amount paid to the Fund in accordance with the 
above will be exclusively allocated to the Fund and be credited to the Treasury 
Account and form part of the Available Collections. 
In addition, and in any case, the Seller shall indemnify in full and hold harmless the 
Fund from and against any and all damages and claims (whether or not successful, 
compromised or settled), actions, demands, proceedings or judgments which may be 
instituted, made, threatened, alleged, asserted or established from time to time in any 
jurisdiction initiated by the Borrowers or any successors therefrom in connection with 
the Non-Compliant Receivables and from all damages which the Fund may suffer or 
incur from time to time (including all costs and expenses reasonably incurred in the 
defence of the interest of the Fund, and any direct and indirect tax implications that 
such indemnity payment may trigger for the Fund including, but not limited to, any 
corporate income tax that shall be levied on the Fund as a consequence of collecting 
such amounts). 
For these purposes, Non-Compliant Receivable means any Purchased Receivable 
which does not comply with the Eligibility Criteria on the relevant Purchase Date. 
 
Limits of the remedies in case of non-conformity 
(c)
The remedies set out in this section 2.2.9 are the sole remedies available to the Fund 
in respect of the non-compliance of any Purchased Receivable with the Eligibility 
Criteria. Under no circumstance may the Management Company request an additional 
indemnity from the Seller relating to a breach of any such representations or 
warranties.  
To the extent that any loss arises as a result of a matter which is not covered by those 
representations and warranties, the loss will remain with the Fund. In particular, but 
without limitation, the Seller has given and will give no warranty as to the ongoing 
solvency of the Borrowers of the Purchased Receivables. 
Furthermore, the representations and warranties given or made by the Seller in 
relation to the compliance of the Receivables with the Eligibility Criteria shall not 
entitle the Noteholders to assert any claim directly against the Seller, the Management 
Company having the exclusive competence under Law 5/2015 to represent the Fund, 
and more generally, the Fund as against third parties and in any legal proceedings. 
2.2.10. Insurance policies in relation to the Receivables  
The Seller has not entered into any insurance policy in relation to the Receivables 
(without prejudice to its potential designation as beneficiary under the possible 
Insurance Policies entered into by the Borrowers as described in section 2.2 above 
under the heading “Insurance”).

all the outstanding Purchased Receivable(s) deriving from such Credit Card 
Agreement has(ve) not been repurchased by the Seller or rescinded).

Addition Amount criteria will not be met on the relevant Purchase 
Date, the Relevant Rating Agencies have confirmed to the

in the context of Initial Transfers only, the Seller has validly made a 
Sale Offer of Receivables to the Fund;  
(G)

financial years without reservations (salvedades) which may affect 
the Receivables and these have been filed with the CNMV. In

Incorporation Date, the Seller has audited financial statements for 
2015 and 2016. 
For these purposes: 
Seller Event of Default means the occurrence of any of the following events:

(ii) 
any of its monetary obligations when due under any Programme Document to 
which it is a party (except if the breach is due to force majeure) and such 
breach is not remedied by the Seller within five (5) Business Days (or within 
ten (10) Business Days if the breach is due to technical reasons) after the 
earlier of the date on which it is aware of such breach and/or receipt of 
notification in writing to the Seller by the Management Company to remedy

Calculation Date prior to the corresponding Payment Date by the Management Company on 
an aggregate basis for all Eligible Receivables purchased by the Fund during the preceding 
Purchase Period, and will not be individually allocated to any particular Purchased

Price for all Eligible Receivables purchased on any given Purchase Period will be equal to 
100% of the aggregate Outstanding Principal Balance of such Eligible Receivables as of the 
applicable Effective Purchase Dates. 
The Purchase Price will be paid as follows: 
 
the Effective Purchase Price of the Eligible Receivables purchased during a Purchase 
(a)
Period shall be paid on the immediately following Payment Date subject to the 
applicable Priority of Payments; and/or  
 
the Deferred Purchase Price shall be paid on each Payment Date following the 
(b)
Payment Date on which the Effective Purchase Price of such Eligible Receivables has 
been or should have been paid subject to the applicable Priority of Payments.

on the following Payment Date in accordance with the applicable Priority of Payments for the

Purchase Period.  
During the Programme Revolving Period (if the Residual Principal Deficiency Ledger is in 
debit at the preceding Calculation Date), the Programme Amortisation Period and the 
Programme Accelerated Amortisation Period, the purchase of new Eligible Receivables will 
be funded through the Deferred Purchase Price (and/or principally with the Available 
Distribution Amount, if any, in accordance with the relevant Priority of Payments). 
For clarification purposes, the Deferred Purchase Price is not limited and could be used to 
fund the total amount of the Purchase Price of the Eligible Receivables purchased by the Fund 
during the Programme Revolving Period (if the Residual Principal Deficiency Ledger is in 
debit at the preceding Calculation Date), the Programme Amortisation Period and the 
Programme Accelerated Amortisation Period.

Purchase Price is only a term for the payment of this portion of the Purchase Price by the 
Fund to the Seller and shall not constitute a ground to rescind (resolver or rescindir) the 
transfer of the corresponding Eligible Receivable. Such Deferred Purchase Price shall be 
added to the existing Deferred Purchase Prices which remain unpaid as of such Payment Date 
(if any) and therefore increase the outstanding amount of Aggregate Deferred Purchase Price. 
The Fund shall pay to the Seller interest (the DPP Interest) on the outstanding Aggregate 
Deferred Purchase Price in accordance with the following provisions: 
 
DPP Interest will be calculated by the Management Company on each Calculation 
(a)
Date. 
 
The amount of DPP Interest payable to the Seller (the Aggregate DPP Interest 
(b)
Amount) will be equal to the product of: 
(i) 
the relevant Seller Share Interest Rate;  
(ii) 
the Aggregate Deferred Purchase Price as of the preceding Payment Date; 
and  
(iii) 
the day count fraction corresponding to the ratio between (i) the actual 
effective days in each Interest Accrual Period and (ii) a 360-day year,  
and rounding the resultant figure to the nearest cent.  
For these purposes, the term while there is a Deferred Purchase Price shall be divided 
into consecutive interest accrual periods (each of them, an Interest Accrual Period) 
comprising the days effectively elapsed between each Payment Date, including in 
each Interest Accrual Period the initial Payment Date and excluding the final 


 
 
 
191 
 
Payment Date. The first Interest Accrual Period shall commence on the date on which 
there is a Deferred Purchase Price amount and end on the immediately following 
Payment Date.  
 
The Aggregate DPP Interest Amount will be paid in accordance with and subject to 
(c)
the Priority of Payments.  
 
Any Aggregate DPP Interest Amounts which have not been paid to the Seller due to 
(d)
shortage of Available Distribution Amounts will be paid on the following Payment 
Date on which the Available Distribution Amounts permit said payment according to 
the applicable Priority of Payments. Such amounts will be paid in preference to the 
Aggregate DPP Interest Amounts payable on said Payment Date. The Aggregate DPP 
Interest Amounts owed to the Seller that remain unpaid according to the provisions of 
the prior paragraphs will not accrue default interest in favour of the Seller.

(e)
cancelled and deemed as a final loss for the Seller.

3.3.1.6. 
Priority Allocation Rule 
If, at any time and for any reason whatsoever, in respect of a Credit Card Agreement from 
which arise any Purchased Receivable(s), the Seller is still the owner of any outstanding 
receivable(s) under such Credit Card Agreement which are not Purchased Receivables (the 


 
 
 
196 
 
Non Purchased Receivables and together with the Purchased Receivables arising from the 
same Credit Card Agreement, the Common Receivables), the Seller and the Fund will have a 
joint ownership right on any payments made by the relevant Borrower with respect to such 
Credit Card Agreement.  
In such circumstance, the Seller's rights on any payments of principal, interest and any other 
amounts paid by the Borrower under the Non Purchased Receivables will be subordinated to 
the rights of the Fund to receive such payments and such amounts under the Purchased 
Receivables arising from the same Credit Card Agreement. 
As a result of the above and until the full repayment of the Purchased Receivables held by the 
Fund in respect of any Credit Card Agreement: 
 
the Fund shall be entitled to receive in priority, all principal and interest amounts 
(a)
(including any arrears and penalties thereon) received by the Servicer from the 
relevant Borrower and such amounts shall constitute Available Collections; 
 
the Fund shall receive the Insurance Indemnifications received from the Insurance 
(b)
Companies in relation to Common Receivables and such amounts shall constitute 
Available Collections; and 
 
the Seller hereby waives any rights to retain or be retransferred by the Servicer any 
(c)
such amounts paid by a Borrower in connection with the Common Receivables and 
undertakes to transfer any and all amounts received by it to the Fund. 
The priority allocation rule sets out herein will apply: 
 
to any Credit Card Agreement for which a Purchased Receivable has been transferred 
(a)
by the Seller to the Fund; 
 
during the Programme Revolving Period, the Programme Amortisation Period and the 
(b)
Programme Accelerated Amortisation Period, as from the Purchase Date of such 
Purchased Receivable in the context of an Initial Transfer and until the earlier of (i) 
the date on which all Purchased Receivables held by the Fund in respect of such 
Credit Card is fully repaid or (ii) the last Settlement Date preceding the Fund 
Liquidation Date. 
3.3.1.7. 
Contractual Documents and Files 
The transfer of the Eligible Receivables in the context of Initial Transfers or Additional 
Transfers on any Purchase Date shall not transfer to the Fund title to the legal documents 
(including private legal documents) in possession of the Seller and documents which 
constitute the legal medium (soporte legal) of such Eligible Receivables, including the Credit 
Card Agreements (the Contractual Documents) as at the corresponding Purchase Date.  


 
 
 
197 
 
Notwithstanding the above, the Seller shall (i) ensure the safekeeping of the Contractual 
Documents relating to the Purchased Receivables, (ii) establish appropriate custody 
procedures and an independent internal ongoing control of such procedures, and (iii) make 
available promptly to the Servicer (or the Replacement Servicer, as the case may be) all such 
Contractual Documents that the Servicer (or the Replacement Servicer, as the case may be) 
may require in the exercise of its duties, including, without limitation, for the purposes of 
enforcing the rights of the Fund under the Eligible Receivables. 
3.3.1.8. 
Insurance Indemnifications  
The transfer of the Eligible Receivables to the Fund implies the transfer of any Insurance 
Indemnifications payable to the Seller under any Insurance Policies entered into by the 
relevant Borrower in connection with any Credit Card Agreement.  
The Seller shall: 
 
notify the Fund as soon as it becomes aware of the existence of any Insurance 
(a)
Indemnifications payable under the Insurance Policies; and  
 
transfer such Insurance Indemnifications: to the Collections Account promptly and in 
(b)
any case within two (2) Business Days after receipt in the relevant Seller’s accounts 
(provided that such amounts are received within banking hours on the Business Day 
they are received by the Seller, otherwise the following Business Day), unless such 
Insurance Indemnifications have been effectively and directly credited to the Treasury 
Account by the Insurance Companies.  
 
then, once received into the Collections Account, to the Treasury Account 
(c)
3.3.1.9. 
Default of Conformity of the Receivables – Breach of Representations 
and Warranties – Non-Compliant Receivables 
The provisions regarding the breach of representations and warranties and remedies are 
described in section 2.2.9 of the Additional Building Block.  
3.3.1.10. Arrangements affecting the Credit Card Agreements 
 
Introduction 
(a)
The terms of the Credit Card Agreements may be subject to contractual amendments 
between the Seller and the Borrowers, to the extent permitted by: 
(i) 
the applicable laws and regulations; and/or 
(ii) 
the provisions below. 
 
Permitted Amendments 
(b)


 
 
 
198 
 
(i) 
The Seller shall be entitled to agree to any amendments to the Credit Card 
Agreements if such amendment (A) is the mandatory result of a final court’s 
resolution, (B) is imposed by any competent administrative or regulatory 
authority, (C) affects the interest rate or the fees, the instalment due date, the 
instalment amount the maximum authorised credit amount, to the extent 
permitted by the terms of such Credit Card Agreement, the usual Credit 
Policies and the Servicing Policies or (D) is required by applicable laws or 
regulations. 
(ii) 
Furthermore, the Seller shall be entitled to agree amendments to a Credit 
Card Agreement as a result of the renegotiations and compromises reached 
with the Borrowers in accordance with section 3.7.2.12 of the Additional 
Building Block.  
(iii) 
Other than in those cases foreseen in (i) and (ii) above, the Seller may amend 
the terms and conditions of any Credit Card Agreement from which the 
outstanding Purchased Receivables arise after having delivered a prior 
written notice for information purposes to the Management Company and the 
Relevant Rating Agencies (including the terms which may be subject to 
contractual amendments described above), provided that: 
(A) 
such amendment is also applied to any comparable segment of 
credit card agreements owned and/or serviced by the Seller and 
which have the same characteristics as, or substantially similar to, 
the Credit Card Agreements from which the Eligible Receivables 
derive; and 
(B) 
such amendment would not challenge the perfection of the transfer 
to the Fund of any outstanding Purchased Receivables nor the 
potential transfer of any Eligible Receivables (to be transferred to 
the Fund) in the context of an Additional Transfer.  
The failure by the Seller to deliver a prior written notice for information 
purposes to the Management Company and the Relevant Rating Agencies 
shall not entitle the Management Company to refuse an amendment which 
complies with provisions above. 
 
Breach of Undertakings and Remedies 
(c)
In the event that the Seller (i) amends the Credit Card Agreement or (ii) amends, 
waives or renegotiates the terms of any Purchased Receivables in breach of the 
undertakings given by itself in its capacity as Seller or Servicer (including, without 
limitation, in breach of the provisions in section (b) above of this section or section 
3.7.2 of the Additional Building Block), the Seller will repurchase such Receivables, 
under the following conditions: 


 
 
 
199 
 
(i) 
The repurchase shall be made on any Repurchase Date prior to the second 
Cut-Off Date following the date on which the waiver or the new terms of that 
Receivable are applicable (with economic effects between the Seller and the 
Fund from the relevant Effective Repurchase Date, from which the Seller 
shall be entitled to any amounts of principal, interest, fees , default interest (if 
applicable), penalties, Insurance Indemnifications and any other related 
payments received from the corresponding Repurchased Receivables as of 
the relevant Repurchase Date).  
(ii) 
The amount payable as a consequence of such repurchase will be equal to: 
(A) 
the then aggregate Outstanding Principal Balance of each relevant 
Receivable (before such amendment, waiver or renegotiation) and 
any other outstanding Purchased Receivables arisen from the same 
Credit Card Agreement; plus  
(B) 
any accrued and unpaid outstanding interest thereon until (but 
excluding) the Effective Repurchase Date, 
as of such Effective Repurchase Date. Payment will be effected on the 
immediately following Calculation Date.  
If the Seller is unable to repurchase the relevant Receivables in accordance with the 
above, the Fund will keep the ownership of the relevant Receivables and the Seller 
shall indemnify the Fund in an amount equal to the amount payable under paragraph 
(ii) above on the applicable Repurchase Date.  
Any amount paid to the Fund under these provisions will be exclusively allocated to 
the Fund and be credited to the Treasury Account and form part of the Available 
Collections. 
 
Seller Dilutions 
(d)
(i) 
The Seller has undertaken to pay to the Fund all Seller Dilutions with respect 
to any Purchased Receivable.  
(ii) 
The amount of any Seller Dilution, as determined on the Determination Date 
by the Management Company on the basis of the Monthly Servicer Report, 
shall be paid by the Seller on each Calculation Date.  
For these purposes:  
Corrected Available Principal Collections means all amounts subject to any 
adjustment of the Available Principal Collections with respect to the previous 
Collection Periods as determined by the Management Company on the Calculation 
Date. 


 
 
 
200 
 
Seller Dilutions means the amount determined by the Management Company on the 
Determination Date and equal to (i) the Dilutions due by the Seller to the Fund plus 
(ii) with respect to Purchased Receivables relating to Performing Credit Cards only, 
the indemnity to be paid by the Seller in the event of a renegotiation of any Purchased 
Receivables (including the case where such renegotiation is made by WIZINK acting 
as the Servicer) equal to the forgiveness of whole or part of any Outstanding Principal 
Balances of such Purchased Receivables. Such amount shall be paid by the Seller to 
the Fund on or prior the Calculation Date. For clarification purposes, they will not be 
reported in an additional field in the CIFRADOC but rather with a negative sign. 
Dilutions means, on each Determination Date, in respect of the Collection Period 
immediately preceding such Determination Date, the Outstanding Principal Balance 
of any given outstanding Purchased Receivables cancelled by the Seller (in part or in 
full) for the benefit of the Borrowers, as the result of any return, rebate, deduction, 
retention, undue restitution, legal set-off (compensación legal), contractual set-off 
(compensation convencional), judicial set-off (compensation judicial), fraudulent or 
counterfeit transactions, or in respect of merchandise which was refused or returned 
by a Borrower.  
 
Limits of the remedies 
(e)
The repurchase procedure set out in the preceding paragraphs and the payment to the 
Fund of the Seller Dilutions shall be the only remedies available to the Management 
Company in the event of (i) a waiver or a renegotiation of the terms of any 
Receivables which would result in the breach by the Seller, in its capacity as Servicer, 
of its undertakings or (ii) the amendment by the Seller of the Credit Card Agreements 
in breach of the undertakings in section 3.3.1.10 above. 
3.3.1.11. Optional Repurchase Events 
The Seller shall have the right (but not the obligation) to repurchase on any Repurchase Date: 
 
all outstanding Purchased Receivables with respect to any Credit Card Agreement

all outstanding Purchased Receivables with respect to any Credit Card Agreement 
(b)

all outstanding Purchased Receivables with respect to any Credit Card Agreements 
(c)
which have been classified as Defaulted Credit Cards or Delinquent Credit Cards;  
 
during the Programme Revolving Period and during the Programme Amortisation 
(d)
Period, any outstanding Purchased Receivables deriving from Performing Credit 
Cards if the Outstanding Principal Balance of all outstanding Purchased Receivables 
deriving from Performing Credit Cards held by the Fund as of the relevant prior Cut-
Off Date (taking into account for that purpose, the contemplated Receivables 


 
 
 
201 
 
purchased by the Fund in the context of Initial Transfers and such contemplated 
repurchased by the Seller to be made on or before such Repurchase Date) were higher 
than the Minimum Portfolio Amount.  
3.3.1.12. Repurchase Procedure  
Provided that an Optional Repurchase Event referred to in paragraphs (a) to (c) of section 
3.3.1.11 has occurred: 
 
The Seller may inform the Management Company of the occurrence of such Optional 
(a)
Repurchase Event by delivering a written request to the Management Company on 
the Determination Date. 
 
On the Selection Date, the Seller shall then select the Receivables to be retransferred 
(b)
on the contemplated Repurchase Date, which will include, if applicable, any other 
outstanding Purchased Receivables arising from the same Credit Card Agreements so 
the total balance under the relevant Credit Card Agreement(s) is repurchased. 
 
On such Selection Date, the Seller shall send to the Management Company the list of 
(c)
the corresponding Credit Card Agreements from which the Receivables to be 
repurchased derive (the Repurchase File). 
 
As of the close of business on the Confirmation Date, the Seller will proceed to mark 
(d)
the selected receivables as Repurchased Receivables on its IT system with effect as 
from the start of business of the next calendar day (the Effective Repurchase Date).  
 
On the Repurchase Date the Seller will deliver to the Management Company a written 
(e)
repurchase request (each, a Repurchase Request) and a file with the list of 
repurchased Receivables, which would serve for the calculation by the Management 
Company of the Aggregate Repurchase Price of the Repurchased Receivables.  
Provided that the Optional Repurchase Event referred to in paragraph (d) of section 3.3.1.11 
has occurred: 
 
The Seller may inform the Management Company of the occurrence of such Optional 
(a)
Repurchase Event by delivering a written request to the Management Company on 
the Determination Date immediately preceding the contemplated Repurchase Date. 
 
The Seller shall notify the Management Company before 12h00 (CET) on the 
(b)
Determination Date its intention to exercise any repurchase option and a target 
repurchase amount (together with any required information, if necessary) (the Target 
Amount) of Purchased Receivables to be retransferred by the Fund (the 
Contemplated Repurchased Receivables) on the Repurchase Date as contemplated 
in the relevant Repurchase Request (corresponding to the immediately following 
Purchase Date in respect of Initial Transfers). 


 
 
 
202 
 
 
On the Selection Date, the Seller shall select randomly the Receivables to be 
(c)
retransferred on the contemplated Repurchase Date, which will include, if applicable, 
any other outstanding Purchased Receivables arisen from the same Credit Card 
Agreements, provided that:  
(i) 
the aggregate amount of the Repurchase Price of such Receivables shall not 
be greater than the Target Amount as notified by the Seller; and  
(ii) 
the excess (if any) of: 
(A) 
the Target Amount as notified by the Seller; over 
(B) 
the expected Aggregate Repurchase Price of the Receivables 
selected randomly by the Seller  
shall not be greater than EUR 50,000.00. 
 
On such Selection Date, the Seller shall send to the Management Company the 
(d)
Repurchase File. 
 
The Management Company shall confirm on the Confirmation Date that it agrees 
(e)
with the selection and designation of the Purchased Receivables to be repurchased 
made by the Seller.  
 
As of the close of business on the Confirmation Date, the Seller will proceed to mark 
(f)
the selected receivables on its IT system with effect as from the start of business of 
the Effective Repurchase Date.  
 
On the Repurchase Date the Seller will deliver to the Management Company a 
(g)
Repurchase Request together with a file with the list of repurchased Receivables, 
which would serve for the calculation by the Management Company of the Aggregate 
Repurchase Price of the Repurchased Receivables which must be paid by the Seller 
by transfer to the Fund’s Treasury Account on such Repurchase Date.  
Common terms applicable to the repurchase procedures 
Each Repurchase Request shall be irrevocable and binding on the Seller when delivered to the 
Management Company. 
The Management Company shall refuse the exercise of the option by the Seller if the 
Repurchase Conditions Precedent set out in the next section are not met.  
If the Repurchase Conditions Precedent are met, then the Management Company shall 
countersign the Repurchase Request in proof of its acceptance and deliver it to the Seller no 
later than on the Repurchase Date.  


 
 
 
203 
 
If a Repurchase Request is not accepted by the Management Company on the relevant 
Repurchase Date in accordance with the above, such Repurchase Request shall automatically 
lapse with no additional formalities. Notwithstanding any de-marking of the selected 
outstanding Purchased Receivables and the related Credit Card Agreements made by the 
Seller in its IT system prior to the cancellation of the repurchased procedure, the Seller shall 
be obliged to proceed with the necessary manual adjustments and shall calculate and pay, 
under the supervision of the Management Company, to the Fund any amounts of Available 
Collections and Insurance Premia which would have been paid by it to the Fund if the 
repurchase procedure would not have been cancelled. 
After the acceptance of the Repurchase Request by the Management Company: 
 
the Seller shall repurchase all outstanding Receivables deriving from the relevant 
(a)
Credit Card Agreement(s) specified in the related Repurchase File (being specified 
that for the avoidance of doubt any drawing which has not been transferred in the 
context of an Additional Transfer by the Seller to the Fund will not be subject to any 
repurchase);  
 
the Seller will not be entitled to transfer new Receivable(s) in the context of 
(b)
Additional Transfers deriving from such Credit Card Agreements which are the 
subject to the repurchase by the Seller as from the Effective Repurchase Date (unless 
the Seller transfers, on any further Purchase Date, new Receivables deriving from 
such Credit Card Agreement in the context of an Initial Transfer); and 
 
the retransfer shall have economic effects between the Seller and the Fund from the 
(c)
Effective Repurchase Date; therefore the Seller shall be entitled from the Effective 
Repurchase Date to any amounts of principal, interest, fees , default interest (if 
applicable), penalties, Insurance Indemnifications and any other related payments 
received from the corresponding Repurchased Receivables as of the relevant 
Repurchase Date. Any collection received by the Fund (if any) on or after the 
Effective Repurchase Date in relation with such Repurchased Receivables will be 
repaid by the Fund to the Seller. 
The retransfer procedure described herein may be updated or amended from time to time 
between the Seller and the Management Company in order to take into account any upgrade 
or update of the Seller’s information systems, provided that (i) such update or amendment 
will have no adverse effect on the Fund or the rights of the noteholders or the funders of the 
Fund, and (ii) prior written notification will be delivered by the Management Company and 
the Seller to the Relevant Rating Agencies. No amendment to the Deed of Incorporation of 
the Fund shall be required unless the amendment proposed by the Seller and the Management 
Company has a negative effect on the Fund or the rights of the noteholders or the funders of 
the Fund.  
In order to achieve certainty of the date of the retransfer of the Repurchased Receivables for 
the purposes of article 1,526 of the Civil Code, on a monthly basis (if applicable) the 


 
 
 
204 
 
Management Company will electronically forward to the CNMV the Repurchase Request 
signed by both the Seller and the Management together with a data file regarding the 
Repurchased Receivables using the CIFRADOC/CNMV service. 
Notwithstanding the above, at any time and for any reason, the Management Company is 
unable to use the CIFRADOC/CNMV service, the Seller and the Management Company will 
appear before the Spanish Notary designated by the Seller for the purposes of raising to the 
status of a Spanish Public Document any repurchase of Receivables made hereunder 
(provided that all cost and expenses arising from any such notarisations shall be borne by the 
Seller). 
For these purposes: 
Aggregate Repurchase Price means, in relation to all the Repurchased Receivables to be 
repurchased on a Repurchase Date: 
 
the aggregate of the Repurchase Prices of such Repurchased Receivables; plus 
(a)
 
all additional, specific, direct and indirect, costs and expenses incurred by the Fund in 
(b)
respect of the repurchase of such Repurchased Receivables and previously approved 
by the Seller excluding, for the avoidance of any double counting, any item already 
included in the Repurchase Price. 
3.3.1.13. Repurchase Conditions Precedent 
The repurchase of the Contemplated Repurchase Receivables shall only occur on the 
Repurchase Date if the following repurchase conditions precedent (the Repurchase 
Conditions Precedent) are met: 
 
General conditions for all Optional Repurchase Events:  
(a)
(i) 
satisfaction of the Minimum Portfolio Amount Condition as of the 
Calculation Date;  
(ii) 
no Fund Liquidation Event has occurred; and 
(iii) 
the Management Company is not aware that a Seller Event of Default has 
occurred and is continuing.  
 
Specific conditions for the Optional Repurchase Event referred to in paragraph (d) of 
(b)
section 3.3.1.11:  
(i) 
such repurchase of the Contemplated Repurchased Receivables does not 
result in the occurrence of a Revolving Termination Event (if the Repurchase 
Date occurs during the Programme Revolving Period) or an Accelerated 
Amortisation Event (if the Repurchase Date occurs during the Programme 
Revolving Period or the Programme Amortisation Period); and 


 
 
 
205 
 
(ii) 
on the relevant Calculation Date, the Management Company has determined 
that the Residual Principal Deficiency Ledger will not be in debit on the next 
Payment Date after the application of the Interest Priority of Payments. 
3.3.1.14. Aggregate Repurchase Price 
The Aggregate Repurchase Price of the Repurchased Receivables shall be calculated by the 
Management Company on each Calculation Date and shall be paid by the Seller to the Fund 
at the latest on the Repurchase Date. 
3.3.2. Optional Re-Transfer of all Purchased Receivables upon the Liquidation of the 
Fund  
The Seller shall have the right (but not the obligation) to repurchase from the Fund all the 
outstanding Purchased Receivables remaining among the assets of the Fund in the context of 
the liquidation of the Fund following the occurrence of a Fund Liquidation Event in 
accordance with the terms set out in section 4.4.4 of the Registration Document. 
3.3.3. Description of the rights conferred upon the Fund for the acquisition of the 
Receivables 
The Fund, as legal holder of the Purchased Receivables will hold the rights generally 
recognized by applicable law and in the Purchased Receivables.  
Specifically, and without limitation, the transfer of the Receivables will include all accessory

the Fund the following rights as regards the Purchased Receivables:  
 
all amounts due for the repayment of the principal of the Purchased Receivables; 
(a)
 
all amounts due for the ordinary interest on the Purchased Receivables; 
(b)
 
all amounts due for the default interest (if applicable) on the Purchased Receivables;

and 
 
all potential rights or indemnities in favour of the Seller including, without limitation, 
(f)
any Insurance Indemnifications. 
All the above mentioned rights will accrue in favour of the Fund as from the Effective 
Purchase Date.  


 
 
 
206 
 
For the avoidance of doubt, pursuant to section 2.2 of the Additional Building Block in case 
of returned purchases, any amounts to be reimbursed (including, if applicable, interest) by the 
Seller to the relevant Borrowers will need to be reimbursed by the Fund to the Seller on the 
next Settlement Date, such payment not being subject to the Priority of Payments. 
3.3.4. Notification to the Borrowers and Insurance Companies 
The Borrowers and the Insurance Companies shall be notified of the transfer of the Purchased 
Receivables as soon as practicable: 
 
upon the occurrence of the Servicer Termination Event;  
(a)
 
in any other circumstances where the Servicer, with the prior consent of the 
(b)
Management Company, considers such notification necessary or desirable for the 
maximisation of the recoveries under the Receivables or the Insurance 
Indemnifications.  
In any of the scenarios described above, the Management Company shall be entitled to 
request the Notary to provide the decoding key of the Encrypted Data File in order to be able 
to access to the data included therein. 
The Management Company shall be entitled to notify (or cause to be notified) the Borrowers 
and the Insurance Companies to make all payments in relation to the Purchased Receivables 
or the Insurance Indemnifications, as applicable, directly on the Treasury Account or on any 
other Fund's account in the event of the substitution and replacement of the Issuer Accounts 
Bank pursuant to the terms set out in section 3.4.5 of the Additional Building Block. 
Any costs and expenses arising from the notification of the transfer of the Purchased 
Receivables upon the occurrence of a Servicer Termination Event shall be borne by the 
retiring Servicer.  
Regarding such costs and expenses arising from the notification of the transfer of the 
Purchased Receivables according to paragraph (b) above, they shall be borne by the Fund. 
In addition, if and when the Servicer is requested to confirm or state the capacity in which it is 
administering and servicing the Purchased Receivables and related matters by any Borrower 
or any third party (including a Spanish court) and to whom the Servicer is obliged by law to 
disclose such information, the Servicer shall confirm or state that it is acting in its capacity as 
servicer of the Purchased Receivables and related matters as agent for and on behalf of the 
Fund and not on its own behalf.  
Pursuant to articles 1,527 and 1,198 of the Civil Code, until the moment of notification to the 
Borrowers and/or the Insurance Companies, as applicable, (i) they will be discharged of their 
payment obligations by paying the Seller, and (ii) the Borrowers and/or the Insurance 
Companies, as applicable, will have the right to set off against the Seller their payment 
obligations existing before the transfer and those which came into existence after the transfer 


 
 
 
207

Fund Excess Margin 
Irrespective of any credit enhancement mechanisms described in this section and, if 
applicable, any Hedging Agreements specified in any Issuing Document, the main protection

Subordinated Facility Provider, to credit the Treasury Account with a drawdown 
under the General Reserve Subordinated Facility for an amount equivalent to the 
General Reserve Increase Amount taking into account, the Initial Principal Amount 
of the Notes to be issued on such Issue Date.  
 
Decrease of the credit balance of the General Reserve  
(f)

balance of the General Reserve will be higher than the General Reserve Required 
Amount on the corresponding Payment Date, the Management Company shall 
calculate the General Reserve Decrease Amount and shall give the relevant 
instructions to the Issuer Accounts Bank to debit on the Payment Date the Treasury 
Account in such amount which: 
(i) 
firstly, will be used to repay any principal outstanding under the General 
Reserve Subordinated Facility on such Payment Date;

(ii) 
secondly, provided that there are no amounts of principal or interest 
outstanding under the General Reserve Subordinated Facility, to be

Introduction 
(a)


 
 
 
218 
 
On the Fund Incorporation Date, the Seller as Commingling Reserve Subordinated 
Facility Provider shall provide the Fund a subordinated facility (the Commingling 
Reserve Subordinated Facility) to fund the commingling reserve (the Commingling 
Reserve) up to the Commingling Reserve Required Amount as a credit enhancement 
mechanism to mitigate the commingling risk.  
The main terms and conditions of the Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility 
are described in section 3.4.4.3 of the Additional Building Block. 
 
Establishment of the Commingling Reserve 
(b)
On the Fund Incorporation Date, the Fund shall request an initial drawdown under the 
Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility for an amount equal to the 
Commingling Reserve Required Amount (calculated in accordance with section 
“Commingling Reserve Required Amount” below).  
The Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility Provider shall make the initial 
drawdown available to the Fund on the first Notes Series Issue Disbursement Date 
following the Fund Incorporation Date, for same day-value, by crediting the amount 
of the initial drawdown into the Treasury Account.  
On each Calculation Date, the Management Company shall verify that the credit 
balance of the Commingling Reserve is equal to the applicable Commingling Reserve 
Required Amount on the next Settlement Date (or the applicable Disbursement Date, 
as the case may be) and, if necessary, adopt the measures required to credit the 
account in order to achieve the Commingling Reserve Required Amount. 
 
Purpose and Allocation of the Commingling Reserve  
(c)
The Commingling Reserve will be used and applied by the Management Company to 
satisfy the obligations of the Fund following a breach by the Servicer of its payment 
obligations. 
In such case: 
(i) 
the Commingling Reserve Amount will be immediately used by the 
Management Company and applied to satisfy the obligations of the Fund up 
to the amount of any Available Collections non-transferred to the Treasury 
Account; and 
(ii) 
provided that the Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility Provider is 
also the Servicer), the Management Company will be entitled to set-off the 
claim of the Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility Provider for 
repayment under the Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility against the 
amount of the Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility Provider (as 
Servicer) breached financial obligations, up to the lowest of (i) the unpaid 


 
 
 
219 
 
amount and (ii) the outstanding amount of the Commingling Reserve before 
any use is made to satisfy the obligations of the Fund on such date, and to 
apply the corresponding funds as part of the Available Collections in 
accordance with the Priority of Payments on the immediately following 
Payment Date. 
Except in the circumstances specified above, the amounts standing to the credit of the 
Commingling Reserve shall not be part of the Available Distribution Amount (it shall 
belong to the Available Principal Amount and the Available Interest Amount when 
the breach by the Seller occurs) and shall neither be applied to make any payment due 
in accordance with and subject to the applicable Priority of Payments, nor to 
guarantee any Borrower's payment default under the relevant Purchased Receivables. 
 
Commingling Reserve Required Amount 
(d)
The Commingling Reserve Required Amount shall be calculated by the Management 
Company on the basis of the latest information provided to it by the Servicer. Such 
calculation shall be made on each Calculation Date. 
The credit balance of the Commingling Reserve should be equal to the applicable 
Commingling Reserve Required Amount determined by the Management Company 
and, if necessary, the measures required in order to achieve the Commingling Reserve 
Required Amount must be adopted. 
For these purposes:  
Commingling Reserve Required Amount means an amount equal to the 1.5%% of 
the Outstanding Principal Balance of the receivables.  
Commingling Reserve Shortfall Amount means, as calculated in respect of each 
Payment Date, the positive difference between (i) and (ii): 
(i) 
is equal to the aggregate amount of all uses made under the Commingling 
Reserve in accordance with the Programme Documents since the Fund 
Incorporation Date (including any use to be made as the case may be on such 
Payment Date);  
(ii) 
is equal to the sum of: 
(A) 
the aggregate of all amounts the Fund previously failed to receive 
and for which an use of the Commingling Reserve had been made 
by debit from the Treasury Account (these amounts were due by the 
Seller and therefore will not be reimbursed to it) since the Fund 
Incorporation Date up to such Payment Date (included); 


 
 
 
220 
 
(B) 
the aggregate amount of all Commingling Reserve Shortfall 
Amounts effectively repaid to the Commingling Reserve 
Subordinated Facility Provider since the Fund Incorporation Date 
(excluding the Commingling Reserve Shortfall Amount to be repaid 
as the case may be on such Payment Date). 
 
Adjustments of the Commingling Reserve  
(e)
On each Calculation Date, the Management Company will determine the 
Commingling Reserve Required Amount to be drawn under or repaid to, as the case 
may be, the Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility on the immediately 
following Settlement Date (or the immediately following Disbursement Date when a 
new Note Series is issued, as the case may be) or Payment Date respectively.  
The balance of the Commingling Reserve shall be adjusted on each Settlement Date, 
Disbursement Date (when a new Note Series is issued) or Payment Date (as 
applicable) and shall be always equal to the applicable Commingling Reserve 
Required Amount. The Management Company shall ensure that the credit balance of 
the Treasury Account in concept of Commingling Reserve shall always be equal to 
the applicable Commingling Reserve Required Amount. 
Increase of the credit balance of the Commingling Reserve 
If the Management Company determines on any Calculation Date that the balance of 
the Commingling Reserve will be below the applicable Commingling Reserve 
Required Amount on the next Settlement Date (or the immediately Disbursement

Reserve Required Amount on the next Payment Date, the Management Company 
shall calculate the Commingling Reserve Decrease Amount and shall give the 
relevant instructions to the Issuer Accounts Bank to debit the Treasury Account in 
such amount which will be used to repay any principal outstanding under the 
Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility on such Payment Date, such repayment 
not being subject to the relevant Priority of Payments. 
Notwithstanding the above, if the Management Company does not receive any 
Monthly Servicer Report, it shall be entitled to retain any amount that should be used

which should be transferred by the Servicer to the Fund in respect of all Available 
Collections it received during all Collection Periods for which no Monthly Servicer 
Report had been prepared by the Servicer and/or sent to the Fund by the Servicer. 
If the Management Company has ultimately received the Monthly Servicer Report(s) 
and/or the abovementioned satisfactory documentary evidence, the Management 
Company shall make the necessary reconciliations and determine the final amount of 
the Commingling Reserve

Fund and deposited from time to time in the Collections Account (including the interest 
accrued from time to time on such amounts (if any) and all claims and rights of WIZINK (as

222 
 
As long as the Collections Account Bank has not received a Stop Instruction Notice from the 
Management Company (acting on behalf of the Fund) (unless a Release Notice is received by 
the Collections Account Bank from the Management Company (acting on behalf of the Fund) 
in respect of such Stop Instruction Notice (with a copy being also sent to the Servicer)): 
 
the Servicer shall be entitled to instruct the Collections Account Bank to carry out the

Company becoming aware of the occurrence of a Potential Servicer Termination Event, the 
Management Company (acting on behalf of the Fund) may serve a Stop Instruction Notice to

Stop Instruction Notice is received by the Collections Account Bank from the Management 
Company (acting on behalf of the Fund) (with a copy being also sent to the Servicer)):  
 
subject to (b) below, the Servicer shall no longer be entitled to give instructions to the

Credit Card Agreements; 
 
any automatic transfer (if any) of the credit balance of the Collections Accounts to the 
(c)
credit of the Treasury Account put in place at the request of the Servicer shall be 
discontinued; 
 
subject to (b) above, the Collections Accounts will be operated by the Management 
(d)
Company only (and/or by any person designated by the Management Company); 
 
the Management Company (and/or by any person designated by the Management 
(e)
Company) shall instruct the Collections Account Bank to automatically transfer to the 
Treasury Account the credit balance of the Collections Accounts as well as any funds 
received daily thereafter as from the start of the Stop Instruction Notice until a 
Release Notice is served. 


 
 
 
223 
 
If the Management Company is satisfied that the Potential Servicer Termination Event 
mentioned in the Stop Instruction Notice is remedied within the corresponding cure period (if 
any) and no other event which could result in a Potential Servicer Termination Event has 
occurred, the Management Company (acting on behalf of the Fund) shall send a Release 
Notice to the Collections Accounts Bank, with copy to the Servicer. Forthwith upon receipt 
by the Collections Account Bank of a Release Notice delivered by the Management Company 
(acting on behalf of the Fund) and without prejudice to the right of the Management Company 
to send further Stop Instruction Notices to the Collections Account Bank, with copy to the 
Servicer: 
 
the Servicer shall be again authorised to operate any Collections Accounts by giving 
(f)
credit and debit instructions to the Collections Accounts Bank (in accordance with the 
provisions above); and 
 
any automatic transfer (if any) of the credit balance of the Collections Accounts to the 
(g)
credit of the Treasury Account put in place at the request of the Servicer and 
discontinued in accordance with the above shall be resumed.

the credit balance from each Collections Accounts only to the extent necessary in order to 
ensure that all the outstanding amounts under the Secured Obligations are irrevocably and

The Pledge will only be discharged once all the Secured Obligations are unconditionally and 
irrevocably paid and discharged in full. 
Furthermore, in accordance with the Collections Accounts Security Document, the Servicer 
shall grant at its own expense, a deed (escritura) of irrevocable power of attorney (the 
Irrevocable Power of Attorney) in favour of the Management Company, acting in the name 
of the Fund, in relation to the Pledge in order to ensure compliance with the undertakings 
assumed by virtue of the Collections Accounts Security Document.

3.4.4. Details of any subordinated debt financing 
The Subordinated Facilities Providers will grant the Fund the Subordinated Facilities, the 
main terms and conditions whereof are described below.  
For these purposes, Subordinated Facilities Providers means (i) the Commingling Reserve 
Subordinated Facility Provider, (ii) the Expenses Subordinated Facility Provider, (iii) the 
General Reserve Subordinated Facility Provider and (iv) the Seller Interest Credit Facility 
Provider. 


 
 
 
226 
 
3.4.4.1 
Expenses Subordinated Facility 
The Expenses Subordinated Facility Provider will grant a subordinated facility (the Expenses 
Subordinated Facility) to the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Expenses 
Subordinated Facility Agreement (the Expenses Subordinated Facility Agreement) that the 
Management Company will use to fund the Initial Expenses and the Note Series Issue 
Expenses (the Fund Non-Operative Expenses). 
The Expenses Subordinated Facility is of a subordinated nature, such that the interest and 
principal amounts owed to the Expenses Subordinated Facility Provider will be subject, as the 
case may be, to the applicable Priority of Payments set out in section 3.4.7.2 of this 
Additional Building Block. 
The aggregate maximum amount of the Expenses Subordinated Facility is up to EUR 
1,100,000, corresponding to the Initial Expenses and the Note Series Issue Expenses in 
connection with the first Notes Series issued by the Fund (the Maximum Expenses 
Subordinated Facility Amount). 
Notwithstanding the above, further to any drawdown request, the Expenses Subordinated 
Facility Provider undertakes to, and the Management Company, acting in the name and on 
behalf of the Fund, agrees to, increase the Maximum Expenses Subordinated Facility Amount 
to make available any amounts required to fund the Note Series Issue Expenses in connection 
with the issue of further Note Series by the Fund during the Programme Revolving Period, 
being specified that: 
 
the issue of further Note Series by the Fund during the Programme Revolving Period 
(a)
and the amount of the related Note Series Issue Expenses shall be subject to prior 
approval by the Seller; and 
 
such increase shall be made without the need to obtain the prior consent from the 
(b)
Noteholders or other funders of the Fund; and 
 
the failure to fund an amount equal to the Note Series Issue Expenses on or prior the 
(c)
relevant Issue Date of such Note Series is an early termination event of the issue of a 
Note Series pursuant to section 4.4.7.1 of the Registration Document. 
The amount of the Expenses Subordinated Facility will be drawn through as many 
drawdowns as may be required during the Availability Period. The Availability Period shall 
commence on the Fund Incorporation Date and shall end on the last day of the Programme 
Revolving Period (for these purposes, the Availability Period).  
On the Fund Incorporation Date, the Management Company shall request an initial drawdown 
under the Expenses Subordinated Facility to fund the Initial Expenses and the Note Series 
Issue Expenses of the first Notes Series. The Expenses Subordinated Facility Provider shall 
make such initial drawdown available to the Fund on the first Note Series Disbursement Date, 
for same day-value, by crediting its amount into the Treasury Account.  


 
 
 
227 
 
Additionally, and during the Availability Period (to the extent that a new Note Series will be 
issued by the Fund on the following Issue Dates), the Management Company shall request an 
additional drawdown under the Expenses Subordinated Facility in an amount equal to the 
Notes Series Issue Expenses in connection with the forthcoming Note Series as calculated by 
the Management Company and agreed by the Seller. The drawdown request shall need to be 
delivered on or prior to the Calculation date before the Issue Date of the new Notes Series. 
The drawdown amount will be credited in the Treasury Account no later than the relevant 
Disbursement Date. 
The Fund shall repay the amounts made available to it under the Expenses Subordinated 
Facility on each Payment Date by an amount equal to the Available Distribution Amount after 
deducting the amounts ranking ahead of it in the relevant Priority of Payments (the Expenses 
Facility Principal Amount). Moreover, the Fund shall repay principal under the Expenses 
Subordinated Facility on the first Payment Date following the date of each drawdown in an 
amount (if any) equal to the excess of the amount of the relevant drawdown over the amount 
of the relevant Fund Non-Operative Expenses actually incurred or committed by the Fund in 
relation to the relevant Note Series. Such payment shall be made to the Expenses 
Subordinated Facility Provider directly, without application of any Priority of Payments. 
Principal amounts repaid will be available for subsequent drawdowns up to the Maximum 
Expenses Subordinated Facility Amount in connection with the issue of further Notes Series 
exclusively. 
Any Expenses Facility Principal Amounts due under the Expenses Subordinated Facility 
which have not been paid to the Expenses Subordinated Facility Provider due to shortage of 
Available Distribution Amounts will be paid on the following Payment Date on which the 
Available Distribution Amounts permit said payment according to the applicable Priority of 
Payments. Such deferred Expenses Facility Principal Amounts will be paid at the same rank 
but in preference to the Expenses Facility Principal Amounts payable in relation to the 
Expenses Subordinated Facility on said Payment Date. The Expenses Facility Principal 
Amounts owed to the Expenses Subordinated Facility Provider that remains unpaid according 
to the provisions of the prior paragraphs will not accrue default interest in favour of the 
Expenses Subordinated Facility Provider. 
The amounts outstanding under the Expenses Subordinated Facility shall accrue interest. Such 
interest will be calculated on the basis of an annual interest rate, which will be EURIBOR one 
(1) Month + 1% (provided that the interest rate cannot be lower than 0%.) (the Expenses 
Facility Interest Amount).  
For these purposes, EURIBOR one (1) month means , in respect of each Interest Accrual 
Period (as defined below), the rate offered in the Eurozone Interbank market for one-month 
euro deposits which appear on the Reuters EURIBOR01 screen at 11:00 h (Central European 
Time) two (2) TARGET2 Business Days before the date on which such Interest Accrual 
Period begins. If the Reuters screen is not available as at the time specified above, then the 


 
 
 
228 
 
rate for any relevant period will be determined in accordance with the provisions set out in 
section 4.7.6 b) of the Securities Note. 
The term of the Expenses Subordinated Facility shall be divided into consecutive interest 
accrual periods (each of them, an Interest Accrual Period) comprising the days effectively 
elapsed between each Payment Date, including in each Interest Accrual Period the initial 
Payment Date and excluding the final Payment Date. The first Interest Accrual Period shall 
commence on the Fund Incorporation Date and end on the immediately following Payment 
Date.  
The Expenses Facility Interest Amount will be settled on each Payment Date, and will be 
calculated on the following basis: (i) the actual effective days in each Interest Accrual Period 
and (ii) a 360 day year. The Expenses Facility Interest Amount will be paid on each Payment 
Date in accordance with and subject to the Priority of Payments. 
Any Expenses Facility Interest Amount due under the Expenses Subordinated Facility which 
have not been paid to the Expenses Subordinated Facility Provider due to shortage of 
Available Distribution Amounts will be paid on the following Payment Date on which the 
Available Distribution Amounts permit said payment according to the applicable Priority of 
Payments. Such deferred Expenses Facility Interest Amount will be paid at the same rank but 
in preference to the Expenses Facility Interest Amount payable in relation to the Expenses 
Subordinated Facility on said Payment Date. The Expenses Facility Interest Amount owed to 
the Expenses Subordinated Facility Provider that remains unpaid according to the provisions 
of the prior paragraphs will not accrue default interest in favour of the Expenses Subordinated 
Facility Provider. 
The Expenses Subordinated Facility shall be repaid by the Fund in full on the Fund 
Liquidation Date and subject to the full payment of any amounts ranking in higher priority 
pursuant to applicable Priority of Payments. Any amount under the Expenses Subordinated 
Facility not paid on the Fund Liquidation Date shall be cancelled and deemed as a final loss 
for the Expenses Subordinated Facility Provider. 
The Expenses Subordinated Facility Agreement shall end on the earlier of: 
 
the Fund Liquidation Date; or 
(a)
 
as the case may be, the Payment Date on which all the amounts due (either as 
(b)
principal or interest) under the Expenses Subordinated Facility are satisfied and no 
further drawdowns are permitted thereunder. 
3.4.4.2 
General Reserve Subordinated Facility  
The General Reserve Subordinated Facility Provider will grant a General Reserve 
Subordinated Facility to the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the General Reserve 
Subordinated Facility Agreement (the General Reserve Subordinated Facility Agreement) 
that the Management Company will use to fund the General Reserve. 


 
 
 
229 
 
The General Reserve Subordinated Facility is of a subordinated nature, such that the interest 
amounts owed to the General Reserve Subordinated Facility Provider may be subject to the 
relevant Priority of Payments set out in section 3.4.7.2 of this Additional Building Block. 
The maximum amount of the General Reserve Subordinated Facility is up to EUR 5,413,200, 
corresponding to the General Reserve Required Amount as of the first Notes Issue 
Disbursement Date as calculated by the Management Company (the Maximum General 
Reserve Subordinated Facility Amount).  
Notwithstanding the above, further to any drawdown request, the General Reserve 
Subordinated Facility Provider undertakes to, and the Management Company, acting in the 
name and on behalf of the Fund, agrees to, increase the Maximum General Reserve 
Subordinated Facility Amount to the extent required in order to make available any amounts 
required to fund any General Reserve Increase Amount in the context of the issue of further 
Note Series approved by the Seller during the Programme Revolving Period, being specified 
that such increase shall be made without the need to obtain the prior consent from the 
Noteholders or any other funders of the Fund.  
In addition, the General Reserve Subordinated Facility Provider and the Management 
Company, acting in the name and on behalf of the Fund, may agree to voluntarily increase the 
Maximum General Reserve Subordinated Facility Amount from time to time in order to make 
available additional drawdowns under the General Reserve Subordinated Facility to avoid any 
downgrade or withdrawal of the rating of the then outstanding Rated Notes by any Relevant 
Rating Agency. 
The General Reserve Subordinated Facility Provider and the Management Company, acting 
in the name and on behalf of the Fund, may agree to decrease the maximum General Reserve 
Subordinated Facility Amount from time to time during the Programme Revolving Period 
without the need to obtain the prior consent from the Noteholders or any other funders of the 
Fund, subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions: 
 
such decrease shall not cause a repayment or a prepayment of any drawdown 
(a)
previously made under the General Reserve Subordinated Facility; 
 
prior notice is given by the Management Company to each Relevant Rating Agencies 
(b)
no later than thirty (30) calendar days prior to the effective date of such decrease;  
 
any decrease will not result in the downgrade or withdrawal of the then current rating 
(c)
of any of the then outstanding Rated Notes by any of the Relevant Rating Agencies; 
and 
 
the decrease will not cause the occurrence of a Revolving Termination Event or an 
(d)
Accelerated Amortisation Event. 
The amount of the General Reserve Subordinated Facility will be drawn through as many 
drawdowns as may be required during the Availability Period in connection with the issue of 


 
 
 
230 
 
further Note Series only. The Availability Period shall commence on the Fund Incorporation 
Date and shall end on the last day of the Programme Revolving Period (for these purposes, 
the Availability Period).  
On the Fund Incorporation Date, the Management Company shall request an initial drawdown 
under the General Reserve Subordinated Facility for an amount of EUR 5,413,200. The 
amount of the initial drawdown will be equal to the General Reserve Required Amount as of 
the first Notes Issue Disbursement Date, as calculated by the Management Company. The 
General Reserve Subordinated Facility Provider shall make the initial drawdown available to 
the Fund on the first Notes Issue Disbursement Date, for same day-value, by crediting the 
amount of the initial drawdown into the Treasury Account.  
Additionally, and during the Availability Period, if the Management Company determines on 
any Calculation Date that the balance of the General Reserve will be below the General 
Reserve Required Amount on the next Disbursement Date when a Note Series is issued by the 
Fund, the Management Company shall request an additional drawdown under the General 
Reserve Subordinated Facility in respect of the amount of the General Reserve Increase 
Amount. The drawdown request shall need to be delivered on or prior to the Calculation Date 
preceding such Disbursement Date. The General Reserve Increase Amount will be credited in 
the Treasury Account on the Disbursement Date. 
The Fund shall repay the amounts made available to it under the General Reserve 
Subordinated Facility on each Payment Date during the Programme Revolving Period or the 
Programme Amortisation Period by an amount equal to the applicable General Reserve 
Decrease Amount (as determined by the Management Company on the relevant Calculation 
Date) on the relevant Payment Date, such repayment being not subject to the applicable 
Priority of Payments.  
For the avoidance of doubt, no General Reserve Decrease Amount shall be repaid during the 
Programme Accelerated Amortisation Period.  
Any General Reserve Shortfall Amount due under the General Reserve Subordinated Facility 
will be paid on each Payment Date in accordance with the relevant Priority of Payments. The 
General Reserve Shortfall Amount will not accrue interest or default interest in favor of the 
General Reserve Subordinated Facility Provider.  
Principal under the General Reserve Subordinated Facility shall be repaid by the Fund on the 
Fund Liquidation Date in an amount equal to the General Reserve Amount. Any principal 
amount under the General Reserve Subordinated Facility not paid on the Fund Liquidation 
Date pursuant to the preceding paragraphs shall be cancelled and deemed as a final loss for 
the General Reserve Subordinated Facility Provider. 
Principal amounts repaid will be available for subsequent drawdown up to the Maximum 
General Reserve Subordinated Facility Available Amount in connection with the issue of 
further Note Series or to avoid any downgrade or withdrawal of the rating of the then 
outstanding Rated Notes by any Relevant Rating Agency. 


 
 
 
231 
 
The amounts outstanding under the General Reserve Subordinated Facility shall accrue 
interest. Such interest will be calculated on the basis of an annual interest rate, which will be 
EURIBOR for one (1) Month + 1% (provided that the interest rate cannot be lower than 0%) 
(the General Reserve Interest Amount).  
For these purposes, EURIBOR one (1) month means , in respect of each Interest Accrual 
Period (as defined below), the rate offered in the Eurozone Interbank market for one-month 
euro deposits which appear on the Reuters EURIBOR01 screen at 11:00 h (Central European 
Time) two (2) TARGET2 Business Days before the date on which such Interest Accrual 
Period begins. If the Reuters screen is not available as at the time specified above, then the 
rate for any relevant period will be determined in accordance with the provisions set out in 
section 4.7.6 b) of the Securities Note. 
The term of the General Reserve Subordinated Facility shall be divided into consecutive 
interest accrual periods (each of them, an Interest Accrual Period) comprising the days 
effectively elapsed between each Payment Date, including in each Interest Accrual Period the 
initial Payment Date and excluding the final Payment Date. The first Interest Accrual Period 
shall commence on the Fund Incorporation Date and end on the immediately following 
Payment Date.  
The General Reserve Interest Amount will be settled on each Payment Date, and will be 
calculated on the following basis: (i) the actual effective days in each Interest Accrual Period 
and (ii) a 360 day year. The General Reserve Interest Amount will be paid on each Payment 
Date in accordance with the relevant Priority of Payments. 
Any General Reserve Interest Amounts due under the General Reserve Subordinated Facility 
which have not been paid to the General Reserve Subordinated Facility Provider due to 
shortage of Available Distribution Amounts will be paid on the following Payment Date on 
which the Available Distribution Amounts permit said payment according to the applicable 
Priority of Payments. Such deferred amounts will be paid on the same rank but in preference 
to the General Reserve Interest Amounts payable in relation to the General Reserve 
Subordinated Facility on said Payment Date. The General Reserve Interest Amounts owed to 
the General Reserve Subordinated Facility Provider that remains unpaid according to the 
provisions of the prior paragraphs will not accrue default interest in favour of the General 
Reserve Subordinated Facility Provider. 
Any General Reserve Interest Amount under the General Reserve Subordinated Facility not 
paid on the Fund Liquidation Date shall be cancelled and deemed as a final loss for the 
General Reserve Subordinated Facility Provider.  
The General Reserve Subordinated Facility Agreement shall end on the earlier of: 
 
the Fund Liquidation Date; or 
(a)


 
 
 
232 
 
 
as the case may be, the Payment Date on which all the amounts due (either as 
(b)
principal or interest) under the General Reserve Subordinated Facility are satisfied 
and no further drawdowns are permitted thereunder. 
3.4.4.3 
Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility  
The Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility Provider will grant a Commingling Reserve 
Subordinated Facility in accordance with the provisions of the Commingling Reserve 
Subordinated Facility Agreement (the Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility 
Agreement) that the Management Company will use to fund the Commingling Reserve. 
The Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility is of a subordinated nature, such that the 
interest amounts owed to the Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility Provider will be 
subject to the relevant Priority of Payments set out in section 3.4.7.2 of this Additional 
Building Block. 
The total amount of the Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility will be EUR 
€30,000,000.00 (the Maximum Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility Amount).  
Notwithstanding the above, further to any drawdown request, the Commingling Reserve 
Subordinated Facility Provider undertakes to, and the Management Company, acting in the 
name and on behalf of the Fund agrees to, increase the Maximum Commingling Reserve 
Subordinated Facility Amount to the extent required in order to make available any amounts 
required to fund any Commingling Reserve Increase Amount during the Availability Period, 
being specified that: 
a) no prior consent from the Noteholders or any other funders of the Fund will be required; 
b) the failure to fund the Commingling Reserve up to the Commingling Reserve Required 
Amount on the Issue Date of the relevant Note Series is an early termination event of the 
issue of a Note Series pursuant to section 4.4.7.1 of the Registration Document.  
In addition, the Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility Provider and the Management 
Company, acting in the name and on behalf of the Fund, may agree to decrease the Maximum 
Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility Amount from time to time without the need to 
obtain the prior consent from the Noteholders or any other funders of the Fund, subject to the 
satisfaction of the following conditions: 
 
such decrease shall not cause a repayment or a prepayment of any drawdown 
(a)
previously made under the Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility; 
 
prior notice is given by the Management Company to each Relevant Rating Agencies 
(b)
no later than thirty (30) calendar days prior to the effective date of such decrease;  


 
 
 
233 
 
 
any decrease will not result in the downgrade or withdrawal of the then current rating 
(c)
of any of the then outstanding Rated Notes by any of the Relevant Rating Agencies; 
and 
 
the decrease will not cause the occurrence of a Revolving Termination Event or an 
(d)
Accelerated Amortisation Event. 
The amount of the Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility will be drawn through as 
many drawdowns as may be required during the Availability Period. The Availability Period 
shall commence on the Fund Incorporation Date and shall end on the Fund Liquidation Date 
(for these purposes, the Availability Period).  
On the Fund Incorporation Date, the Management Company shall request an initial drawdown 
under the Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility for an amount of EUR 8,250,000.00. 
The amount of the initial drawdown will be equal to the Commingling Reserve Required 
Amount, as of the first Notes Issue Disbursement Date as calculated by the Management 
Company. The Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility Provider shall make the initial 
drawdown available to the Fund on the first Notes Issue Disbursement Date for same day-
value, by crediting the amount of the initial drawdown into the Treasury Account 
Additionally, and during the Availability Period, if the Management Company determines on 
any Calculation Date on the basis of the information provided to it by the Servicer that the 
balance of the Commingling Reserve will be below the applicable Commingling Reserve 
Required Amount on the relevant Settlement Date or Disbursement Date when a new Note 
Series is issued, as the case may be, the Management Company shall request on such 
Calculation Date an additional drawdown under the Commingling Reserve Subordinated 
Facility in an amount equal to Commingling Reserve Increase Amount to be credited in the 
Treasury Account on the next Settlement Date (and/or, if applicable, on the Disbursement 
Date when a new Note Series is issued).  
If the Management Company determines on a Calculation Date that the estimated balance of 
the Commingling Reserve will be exceeding the applicable Commingling Reserve Required 
Amount on the next Payment Date, the Management Company shall calculate the 
Commingling Reserve Decrease Amount and shall give the relevant instructions to the Issuer 
Accounts Bank to debit the Treasury Account in such amount which will be used to repay any 
principal outstanding under the Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility on such Payment 
Date, such repayment not being subject to the relevant Priority of Payments. 
Notwithstanding the above, if the Management Company does not receive any Monthly 
Servicer Report, it shall be entitled to retain any amount that should be used to repay the 
Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility in the Treasury Account until the date on which 
Management Company shall receive from the Servicer (or any replacement servicer) the 
Monthly Servicer Report or other documentary evidence which demonstrates to the 
satisfaction of the Management Company that there are no remaining amounts which should 
be transferred by the Servicer to the Fund in respect of all Available Collections it received 


 
 
 
234 
 
during all Collection Periods for which no Monthly Servicer Report had been prepared by the 
Servicer and/or sent to the Fund by the Servicer. 
If the Management Company has ultimately received the Monthly Servicer Report(s) and/or 
the abovementioned satisfactory documentary evidence, the Management Company shall 
make the necessary reconciliations and determine the final amount of the Commingling 
Reserve.  
The Fund may re-borrow any part of the Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility which 
is repaid up to the Maximum Commingling Reserve Facility Available Amount.  
Principal under the Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility shall be repaid by the Fund 
on the Fund Liquidation Date subject to the repayment in full of the Notes of any Notes 
Series. Any amount under the Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility not paid pursuant 
to the preceding paragraphs shall be cancelled and deemed as a final loss for the 
Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility Provider. 
The amounts outstanding under the Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility shall accrue 
interest. Such interest will be calculated on the basis of an annual interest rate, which will be 
EURIBOR for one (1) Month + 1% (provided that the interest rate cannot be lower than 0%) 
(the Commingling Reserve Interest Amount).  
For these purposes, EURIBOR one (1) month means, in respect of each Interest Accrual Period (as 
defined below), the rate offered in the Eurozone Interbank market for one-month euro deposits which 
appear on the Reuters EURIBOR01 screen at 11:00 h (Central European Time) two (2) TARGET2 
Business Days before the date on which such Interest Accrual Period begins. If the Reuters screen is 
not available as at the time specified above, then the rate for any relevant period will be determined in 
accordance with the provisions set out in section 4.7.6 b) of the Securities Note. 
The term of the Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility shall be divided into consecutive 
interest accrual periods (each of them, an Interest Accrual Period) comprising the days 
effectively elapsed between each Payment Date, including in each Interest Accrual Period the 
initial Payment Date and excluding the final Payment Date. The first Interest Accrual Period 
shall commence on the first Note Series Issue Disbursement Date and end on immediately 
following Payment Date.  
The Commingling Reserve Interest Amount will be settled on each Payment Date, and will be 
calculated on the following basis: (i) the actual effective days in each Interest Accrual Period 
and (ii) a 360 day year. The Commingling Reserve Interest Amount will be paid on each 
Payment Date in accordance with the Priority of Payments. 
Any Commingling Reserve Interest Amount due under the Commingling Reserve 
Subordinated Facility which have not been paid to the Commingling Reserve Subordinated 
Facility Provider due to shortage of Available Distribution Amounts will be paid on the 
following Payment Date on which the Available Distribution Amounts permit said payment 
according to the applicable Priority of Payments. Such deferred amounts will be paid on the 


 
 
 
235 
 
same rank but in preference to the Commingling Reserve Interest Amount payable in relation 
to the Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility on said Payment Date. The Commingling 
Reserve Interest Amounts owed to the Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility Provider 
that remain unpaid according to the provisions of the prior paragraphs will not accrue default 
interest in favour of the Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility Provider. 
Any Commingling Reserve Interest Amount not paid upon termination of the Commingling 
Reserve Subordinated Facility Agreement shall be cancelled and deemed as a final loss for 
the Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility Provider. 
The Commingling Reserve Subordinated Facility Agreement shall end on the Fund 
Liquidation Date. 
3.4.4.4 
Seller Interest Credit Facility 
The Seller Interest Credit Facility Provider will make available a seller interest facility (the 
Seller Interest Credit Facility) in accordance with the provisions of the Seller Interest Credit 
Facility Agreement (the Seller Interest Credit Facility Agreement) that the Management 
Company will use to:  
 
with regards to the purchase of the initial portfolio of Eligible Receivables on the 
(a)
Fund Incorporation Date: 
(i) 
to finance in part (together with any Notes Series issued on the Fund 
Incorporation Date) the purchase of the initial portfolio of Eligible

Eligible Receivables from the Seller. 
 
on any Settlement Date (other than the Fund Incorporation Date) during the 
(b)
Programme Revolving Period:  
(i) 
to finance in full or in part the purchase of Receivables (either in the context 
in Initial Transfers or Additional Transfers) from the Seller on any Purchase 
Date; and/or  
(ii) 
to redeem existing Note Series. 
On each Calculation Date, the Management Company will determine the SICF Drawing 
Amount and the amount to be, as the case may be, drawn under the Seller Interest Credit 
Facility or repaid to the Seller Interest Credit Facility Provider. 


 
 
 
236 
 
The Seller Interest Credit Facility is of a subordinated nature during the Programme 
Amortisation Period and the Programme Accelerated Amortisation Period, such that the 
principal and interest amounts owed to the Seller Interest Credit Facility Provider will be 
subject to the relevant Priority of Payments set out in section 3.4.7.2 of this Additional 
Building Block. 
The total amount of the Seller Interest Credit Facility will be EUR five hundred million 
(€500,000,000 (the Maximum Seller Interest Credit Facility Amount).  
Notwithstanding the above, further to any drawdown request, the Seller Interest Credit 
Facility Provider undertakes to, and the Management Company, acting in the name and on 
behalf of the Fund, agrees to, increase the Maximum Seller Interest Credit Facility Amount to 
the extent required in order to make available additional drawdowns under the Seller Interest 
Credit Facility to fund any SICF Drawing Amount during the Programme Revolving Period, 
being specified that such increase shall be made without the need to obtain the prior consent 
from the Noteholders or any other funders of the Fund. 
In addition, the Seller Interest Credit Facility Provider and the Management Company, acting 
in the name and on behalf of the Fund may decrease the Maximum Seller Interest Credit 
Facility Amount from time to time without the need to obtain the prior consent from the 
Noteholders or any other funders of the Fund, subject to the satisfaction of the following 
conditions: 
 
such decrease shall not cause a repayment or a prepayment of any drawdown 
(a)
previously made under the Seller Interest Credit Facility; 
 
the Maximum Seller Interest Credit Facility Amount will be at least equal to EUR 
(b)
€250,000,000; 
 
prior notice is given by the Management Company to each Relevant Rating Agencies 
(c)
no later than thirty (30) calendar days prior to the effective date of such decrease;  
 
any decrease will not result in the downgrade or withdrawal of the then current rating 
(d)
of any of the then outstanding Rated Notes by any of the Relevant Rating Agencies; 
and 
 
the decrease will not cause the occurrence of a Revolving Termination Event or an 
(e)
Accelerated Amortisation Event. 
The amount of the Seller Interest Facility will be drawn through as many drawdowns as may 
be required during the Availability Period. The Availability Period shall commence on the 
Fund Incorporation Date and shall end on the last day of the Programme Revolving Period 
(the Availability Period). 
The Fund may request a drawdown under the Seller Interest Credit Facility on the 
Disbursement Date of the first Note Series issued by the Fund, and thereafter on any 


 
 
 
237 
 
Calculation Date for an amount up to (the Seller Interest Credit Facility Drawing Amount 
or the SICF Drawing Amount):  
 
during the Programme Revolving Period and if the Residual Principal Deficiency 
(a)
Ledger is not in debit at the preceding Calculation Date, the minimum between (i) and 
(ii) where: 
(i) 
the SICF Required Drawdown Amount on such Settlement Date; and 
(ii)

during the Programme Revolving Period (if the Residual Principal Deficiency Ledger 
(b)
is in debit at the preceding Calculation Date), the Programme Amortisation Period 
and the Programme Accelerated Amortisation Period, zero (0). 
For these purposes: 
Asset-Liability Mismatch Amount means on any Calculation Date, the positive difference 
between (a) and (b) where: 
 
is the aggregate of (i) and (ii) below: 
(a)
(i) 
the Outstanding Principal Balances of the Purchased Receivables (excluding 
any Non-Compliant Receivables) under the Performing Credit Cards as of the 
immediately prior Cut-Off Date to such Calculation Date; plus  
(ii) 
the Unapplied Revolving Amount (if any) that will be retained i the Treasury 
Account on the Payment Date after such Calculation Date.  
 
is the aggregate of the Principal Amount Outstanding of all Notes of all Note Series 
(b)
(taking account any principal payments to be made with respect to the Note Series to 
be amortised or any Note Series to be issued) on or prior to the Payment Date after 
such Calculation Date. 
SICF Required Drawdown Amount means on any Settlement Date, the positive difference 
as calculated on the previous Calculation Date between (a) and (b) where:  
 
the Asset-Liability Mismatch Amount; and 
(a)
 
the SICF Principal Amount Outstanding (taking into account any repayment to be 
(b)
made on such Payment Date following such Settlement Date) on such Settlement 
Date. 
SICF Maximum Drawable Amount means on any Settlement Date, the positive difference 
between (a) and (b) where: 
 
is the Maximum Seller Interest Credit Facility Amount; and 
(a)


 
 
 
238 
 
 
is SICF Principal Amount Outstanding (taking into account any repayment to be 
(b)
made on such Payment Date following such Settlement Date) on such Settlement 
Date. 
Each Drawdown request (other than the one to be made on the Disbursement Date of the first 
Note Series issued by the Fund) shall need to be delivered no later than on the Calculation 
Date preceding the relevant Settlement Date 
The Seller Interest Credit Facility Provider shall make the drawdowns available to the Fund 
on the Disbursement Date of the first Note Series and thereafter (i) on each Settlement Date, 
for same day-value, by set off if the drawdown is used to finance in full or in part the 
purchase of Receivables or (ii) on each Settlement Date, for same day-value by crediting the 
amount of the Drawdowns into the Treasury Account if the drawdown is used to redeem 
existing Note Series.  
The Fund shall repay the Seller Interest Credit Facility made to it in accordance with the 
applicable Priority of Payments on each Payment Date by an amount equal to (the Seller 
Interest Credit Facility Amortisation Amount or the SICF Amortisation Amount): 
 
on any Payment Date during the Programme Revolving Period and if the Residual 
(a)
Principal Deficiency Ledger is not in debit as determined on the preceding 
Calculation Date, the lesser between: 
(i) 
the positive difference between the SICF Principal Amount Outstanding on 
the preceding Payment Date (after the application of the Priority of 
Payments) and the product of (x) Required Seller Share and (y) the Principal 
Amount Outstanding of all Note Series (taking into account any redemption 
or issuance of Note Series to be made between on or before the next Payment 
Date); and 
(ii) 
the positive difference between: 
(A) 
the Available Principal Amount; and 
(B)

Interest Facility on such the Settlement Date preceding such 
Payment Date; and 


 
 
 
239 
 
as the case may be, the amounts applied to item (1) of the 
Principal Priority of Payments;  
 
on any Payment Date during the Programme Revolving Period and if the Residual 
(b)
Principal Deficiency Ledger is in debit on the preceding Calculation Date, zero (0); 
and 
 
on any Payment Date during the Programme Amortisation Period or the Programme 
(c)
Accelerated Amortisation Period:

for so long as all Notes of all Note Series have not been redeemed in full: 
zero (0); and 
(ii) 
upon redemption in full of the Notes of all Note Series: the SICF Principal 
Amount Outstanding as of close of the immediately preceding Payment Date. 
Any SICF Amortisation Amount due under the Seller Interest Credit Facility which has not 
been paid to the Seller Interest Credit Facility Provider due to shortage of Available 
Distribution Amounts will be paid on the following Payment Date on which the Available 
Distribution Amounts permit said payment according to the applicable Priority of Payments. 
Such deferred amounts will be paid on the same rank but in preference to the SICF 
Amortisation Amount payable in relation to the Seller Interest Credit Facility on said Payment 
Date. The SICF Amortisation Amounts owed to the Seller Interest Credit Facility Provider 
that remain unpaid according to the provisions of the prior paragraphs will not accrue default 
interest in favour of the Seller Interest Credit Facility Provider. 
The Seller Interest Credit Facility shall be repaid by the Fund on the Fund Liquidation Date 
and subject to the full payment of any amounts ranking in higher priority pursuant to 
applicable Priority of Payments. Any amount under the Seller Interest Credit Facility not paid 
on the Fund Liquidation Date shall be cancelled and deemed as a final loss for the Seller 
Interest Credit Facility Provider. 
Any SICF Amortisation Amounts repaid will be available for subsequent drawdowns up to 
the Maximum Seller Interest Credit Facility Amount. 
The SICF Principal Amount Outstanding under the Seller Interest Credit Facility shall accrue 
interest as from the relevant Drawdown date until the relevant Drawdown is repaid in an 
amount calculated by the Management Company on the Calculation Date and equal to the 
product of (the Seller Interest Credit Facility Interest Amount or SICF Interest Amount):  
 
the relevant Seller Share Interest Rate;  
(a)
 
the SICF Principal Amount Outstanding as of the preceding Payment Date; and  
(b)


 
 
 
240 
 
 
the day count fraction corresponding to the ratio between (i) the actual effective days 
(c)
in each Interest Accrual Period and (ii) a 360-day year, and rounding the resultant 
figure to the nearest cent.  
For these purposes, Seller Share Interest Rate means, on any Payment Date, the annual 
fixed interest rate which shall be calculated by the Management Company as follows: 
 
for so long as the Class A Notes of any Note Series are outstanding, the average 
(a)
interest rate of all Class A Notes which are outstanding as weighted by their 
respective Principal Amount Outstanding on such Payment Date (taking into account 
the applicable swap rate plus margin for Class A Notes bearing a floating rate, if 
applicable); 
 
once the Class A Notes of all Note Series have been redeemed in full and for so long 
(b)
as the Class B Notes of any Note Series are outstanding, the average interest rate of 
all Class B Notes which are outstanding as weighted by their respective Principal 
Amount Outstanding on such Payment Date (taking into account the applicable swap 
rate plus margin for Class B Notes bearing a floating rate, if applicable); 
 
once the Class B Notes of all Note Series have been redeemed in full and for so long 
(c)
as the Class C Notes of any Note Series are outstanding, the average interest rate of 
all Class C Notes which are outstanding as weighted by their respective Principal 
Amount Outstanding on such Payment Date (taking into account the applicable swap 
rate plus margin for Class C Notes bearing a floating rate, if applicable); and 
 
in any other cases, 1.50 per cent or any other percentage specified as such in the last 
(d)
Prospectus Supplement.  
For information purposes on the first Payment Date after the Fund Incorporation Date the 
Seller Share Interest Rate will be equal to 0.25%. 
The term of the Seller Interest Credit Facility shall be divided into consecutive interest 
accrual periods (each of them, an Interest Accrual Period) comprising the days effectively 
elapsed between each Payment Date, including in each Interest Accrual Period the initial 
Payment Date and excluding the final Payment Date. The first Interest Accrual Period shall 
commence on the Disbursement Date of the first Note Series issued by the Fund and end on 
the immediately following Payment Date.  
The Fund shall pay the SICF Interest Amount as part of the Seller Share Interest Payable 
Amount on each Payment Date during the Programme Revolving Period, the Programme 
Amortisation Period and the Programme Accelerated Amortisation Period in accordance with 
the Priority of Payments as calculated by the Management Company on the Calculation Date 
immediately preceding such Payment Date. 
Any SICF Interest Amount due under the Seller Interest Credit Facility which has not been 
paid to the Seller Interest Credit Facility Provider due to shortage of Available Distribution 


 
 
 
241 
 
Amounts, will be paid on the following Payment Date on which the Available Distribution 
Amounts permit said payment according to the applicable Priority of Payments. Such deferred 
SICF Interest Amounts will be paid on the same rank but in preference to the SICF Interest 
Amounts payable in relation to the Seller Interest Credit Facility on said Payment Date. The 
SICF Interest Amounts owed to the Seller Interest Credit Facility Provider that remain unpaid 
according to the provisions of the prior paragraphs will not accrue default interest in favour of 
the Seller Interest Credit Facility Provider. Any SICF Interest Amounts under the Seller 
Interest Credit Facility not paid on the Fund Liquidation Date shall be cancelled and deemed 
as a final loss for the Seller Interest Credit Facility Provider. 
The Seller Interest Credit Facility Agreement shall end on the earlier of 
 
the Fund Liquidation Date; or 
(a)
 
as the case may be, the Payment Date on which all the amounts due (either as 
(b)
principal or interest) under the Seller Interest Credit Facility are satisfied and no 
further drawdowns are permitted thereunder. 
For these purposes, Seller Interest Credit Facility Principal Amount Outstanding or SICF 
Principal Amount Outstanding means, on any date, the principal amount outstanding of all 
SICF Drawing Amounts made under the Seller Interest Credit Facility.

On the Fund Incorporation Date the Management Company, acting in the name and on behalf 
of the Fund, will enter into an bank agreement (the Financial Agency Agreement) with the 
Issuer Accounts Bank whereby it will open the name of the Fund the following bank accounts 
(the Issuer Accounts): (i) the Treasury Account and (ii), with respect to any Hedging 
Agreement entered into between the Fund and any Eligible Hedging Counterparty, the 
relevant Hedging Collateral Accounts.  
The purpose of the Financial Agency Agreement is to set out the terms and conditions of the

accounts. 
At any time after the Fund Incorporation Date, the Management Company may request from 
time to time the Issuer Accounts Bank to open, in its books and in the Fund’s name, 
additional Issuer Accounts which may be necessary or advisable for the performance by the 
Fund of its rights and obligations under the Programme Documents. No amendment to the 
Deed of Incorporation of the Fund shall be required unless the opening of such additional 
Issuer Accounts has a negative effect on the Fund or the rights of the noteholders or the 


 
 
 
242 
 
funders of the Fund. Such additional Issuer Accounts shall be operated in accordance with the 
terms of this section 3.4.5. 
The common terms applicable to all the Issuer Accounts are described in section 3.4.5.4 
below.  
3.4.5.2.

The Management Company will open (in the name and on behalf of the Fund) the 
Treasury Account, in which all the income of the Fund will be deposited and through 
which all payments due will be made in accordance with the Base Prospectus and the 
Deed of Incorporation. 
As per the instructions of the Management Company, the amounts that are to be 
credited in the Treasury Account include, but are not limited to, the following: 
(i) 
on each Disbursement Date with the net proceeds of the issue by the Fund of 
any Note Series;

Disbursement Date after a Note Series is issued by the Fund, the General 
Reserve Increase Amount; 
(vi) 
on each Settlement Date (and as the case may be, on each Disbursement Date 
when a new Note Series is issued) with the advances under the Commingling 
Reserve Subordinated Facility; 
(vii) 
on or prior each Calculation Date, with the Seller Dilutions (if any) to be paid 
by the Seller to the Fund, and the Corrected Available Collections (if any) to

to repurchase certain outstanding Purchased Receivables;  
(ix) 
on any relevant date, with the Financial Income (if any);  
(x) 
on or prior to the Fund Liquidation Date, with the Reference Repurchase 
Price of the then outstanding Purchased Receivables, as the case may be;  
(xi) 
on or prior to any relevant Payment Date, with the Hedging Net Amount (if 
any) received by the Fund from any relevant Hedging Counterparty (or 
replacement hedging counterparty) and the Hedging Collateral Account 
Surplus (if any);  
(xii) 
with any other amounts to be received from time to time by the Fund 
pursuant to the Programme Documents and which are not allocated in any 
other Issuer Account; and 
(xiii) 
with the proceeds of the liquidation, if any, and where applicable of the 
Receivables. 
All collections and payments during the whole life of the Fund will be centralised in the 
Treasury Account or in any other account that could be opened to carry out the same function. 
For these purposes, Financial Income means the income generated (if any) on the credit 
balances of the Issuer Accounts (except the Hedging Collateral Account(s), if any). The 
interest accrued and credited into Hedging Collateral Account(s) (if any) will be transferred to 
the relevant Hedging Counterparty in accordance with the relevant Hedging Agreement. 
The amounts credited from time to time in the Treasury Account shall accrue interest at a rate 
equal to the EURIBOR plus a margin of -0.10 %, revisable annually. 
The life of the Treasury Account will be divided into successive monthly interest periods 
(each a "Treasury Account Interest Period") beginning on the last day of each calendar 
month (included) and ending on the last day of the following month (excluded), except for the 
first Treasury Account Interest Period, which will start on the Date of Incorporation of the 
Fund (included) and will end on the last day of the calendar month in which the Deed of 
Incorporation is executed (excluded). 
For this purpose EURIBOR (Euro Interbank Offered Rate) is understood as the sum of: 
  
 
The Euro Money Market reference interest rate taken on the second (2nd) business 
(a)
day prior to the beginning of each Treasury Account Interest Period  resulting from 
application of the relevant convention in force from time to time, under the auspices 
of the European Money Markets Institute (EMMI) (currently the convention 
stipulates the reference interest rate published on the Reuters EURIBOR01 screen at 


 
 
 
244 
 
11:00 h (Central European Time) for financing transactions with delivery of funds 
two (2) business days after the date on which the rate is fixed), for deposits in euros 
for one (1) month.  
 
If for any reason, including exceptional circumstances, there is no money market 
reference interest rate for the  relevant period, the Issuer Accounts Bank shall notify 
this circumstance to the Borrower and shall calculate the Euro Money Market 
reference interest rate through linear interpolation of the reference interest rates 
corresponding to the upper period closest to the Treasury Account Interest Period and 
the lower period closest to the Treasury Account Interest Period, both published on 
the Reuters EURIBOR 01 screen or any other that may substitute it. If there is no 
lower period closest to the period of interest, it shall be applicable the interest rate for 
which there is a quote for the upper closest period. This reference interest rate 
obtained by the Issuers Accounts Bank shall be considered to determine the reference 
interest rate referred to in the preceding paragraph. 
 
If for any reason, the Issuers Accounts Bank cannot determine the EURIBOR in 
accordance with the paragraphs above, this circumstance will be immediately 
notified to the Management Company in order to apply a substitute reference 
interest rate. 
 
The substitute reference interest rate to be applied shall be the arithmetic average of 
the reference interest rates on the second business day immediately preceding the 
date of commencement of each Treasury Account Interest Period, for deposits of 1 
(one) year in the case of loan and credit transactions published from time to time by 
Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, S.A., Banco de Sabadell, S.A. and Bankinter, 
S.A., pursuant to the relevant regulation in force. 
 
If any of these entities have not published the reference interest rate, the 
substitute reference rate to be applied shall be the arithmetic average of the 
reference interest rate published by the other entities, or failing them the last 
reference interest rate that was applied pursuant to this section. 
In any case, the reference interest rate estimated pursuant to the paragraph above 
cannot be less than 0%. 
 
Any taxes, charges, levies, state or other surcharges, if any, applicable to deposits in 
(b)
euros obtained on the Eurozone interbank market, and any brokerage fees paid to 
obtain them and any tax on these fees. 
3.4.5.3. 
Hedging Collateral Accounts 
In the case in which, according to what is described in section 3.4.8.1, the interest rate 
exposure of the Fund in relation to any Class of Notes of any Note Series is to be hedged by 


 
 
 
245 
 
the entering into a Hedging Agreement in respect of the relevant Class of Notes of a Note 
Series (the Hedged Notes), a Hedging Collateral Account shall be opened in the books of the 
Issuer Accounts Bank in respect of each Eligible Hedging Counterparty on (or before, if 
possible) the entry into the relevant Hedging Agreement between the Fund and the relevant 
Eligible Hedging Counterparty. The characteristics of the Hedging Collateral Account will be 
specified in the relevant Issuing Document in respect of the Hedged Notes, being in any case 
subject to what is stipulated in the Financial Agency Agreement. 
Entering into a Hedging Agreement is not compulsory even if the Notes have a floating 
interest rate and no Maximum Interest Rate is provided. . 
3.4.5.4. 
Common Terms applicable to the Issuer Accounts 
 
Services provided 
(c)
The Issuer Accounts Bank will provide to the Fund all of the customary services 
relating to the maintenance and administration of the Issuer Accounts, in accordance 
with common banking practices. 
 
Allocations and distributions in the Issuer Accounts. Negative Balance 
(d)
The Issuer Accounts will not be allowed to have a negative balance to the detriment 
of the Fund. The balances in the Issuer Accounts will remain as available cash. 
The allocations and distributions shall be exclusively carried out by the Management 
Company and the Paying Agent, respectively, to the extent of the monies standing 
from time to time to the credit balance of the Issuer Accounts in such manner that no 
Issuer Account shall have a debit balance after applying the relevant Priority of

Hedging Agreements  
General  
The Receivables to be purchased by the Fund bear an adjustable fixed interest rate while the 
Class A Notes and/or the Class B Notes and/or the Class C Notes of any Note Series may bear 
a floating rate of interest as specified in the relevant the Issuing Document. 
Consequently, the Fund may be exposed to interest rate risk which, in the event that it is 
decided to cover, it may be hedged through the setting of a Maximum Interest Rate to the 
relevant Notes or with any Class A Hedging Agreement on the issue of any Class A Floating 
Rate Notes and any Class B Hedging Agreement on the issue of any Class B Floating Rate 
Notes and any Class C Hedging Agreement on the issue of any Class C Floating Rate Notes 
entered into between the Fund, represented by the Management Company, and any Eligible 
Hedging Counterparties. 
If the interest rate exposure of the Fund in relation to any Class of Notes of any Note Series is 
to be hedged by the entering into a Hedging Agreement in respect of the relevant Class of 
Notes of a Note Series (the Hedged Notes), the Management Company, on behalf of the 
Fund, will enter into one or more Hedging Agreements with Eligible Hedging Counterparties, 
as specified in the relevant Issuing Document in respect of the Hedged Notes. It is expected 
that the Hedging Agreements will be interest rate swaps, but other financial derivatives 
agreements (eg. interest rate collar, interest rate cap) may be entered into for hedging 
purposes by the Management Company, on behalf of the Fund, depending on the conditions 
of the financial markets at the time the Hedged Notes are issued. 
The Hedging Agreements will each be documented by means of (i) a master netting 
agreement in the form of the 2002 ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border), as 
published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc., (an ISDA Master 
Agreement) the schedule and the credit support annex thereto (an ISDA Credit Support 
Annex), together with the confirmation setting out the terms of each hedging transaction, (ii) 


 
 
 
269 
 
a Contrato Marco de Operaciones Financieras (a CMOF Master Agreement) in its 2013 
version (or any other version as selected by the Management Company), as prepared by the 
Spanish Bankers Association (Asociación Española de Banca) and the Spanish Savings 
Banks Association (Confederación Española de Cajas de Ahorros), together with its Annex I, 
the credit support annex thereto (Anexo III – Acuerdo de Realización de Cesiones en 
Garantía) (the CMOF Credit Support Annex, and together with the ISDA Credit Support 
Annex, the Credit Support Annex) and the confirmation setting out the terms of each Hedging 
Agreement, or (iii) any other financial transactions master netting documentation which the 
Management Company deems suitable for the relevant Hedging Agreement. 
Payments under the Hedging Agreements 
If the relevant hedging transactions entered into under the Hedging Agreements are interest 
rate swap transactions (IRSs), the basic structure of the hedging transactions to be entered 
into by the Fund is expected to be as follows: 
 
The Eligible Hedging Counterparties will pay to the Fund on the payment dates 
(a)
specified in the relevant transaction confirmations, an amount calculated by reference 
to the Reference Rate payable on the Hedged Notes. 
 
The Eligible Hedging Counterparties will receive from the Fund on, on the payment 
(b)
dates specified in the relevant transactions confirmations, an amount calculated with 
reference to a fixed rate.  
 
Netting between the foregoing fixed and floating payments will apply, in accordance 
(c)
with the terms specified below and pursuant to the Hedging Agreements. 
 
The applicable notional amount for the relevant IRSs will be the aggregate Principal 
(d)
Amount Outstanding of the Hedged Notes on each Payment Date or, otherwise, as set 
out in the relevant transaction confirmations.  
 
The Calculation Agent (as defined in the Hedging Agreement) under the Hedging 
(e)
Agreements shall be set out in the relevant Hedging Agreements. 
 
The fixed rate payable by the Fund under each IRS shall be as agreed between the 
(f)
Management Company, on behalf of the Fund, and the applicable Eligible Hedging 
Counterparties and shall be set out in the relevant transaction confirmation. 
 
Where any Hedging Net Amount is due to be paid by the relevant Eligible Hedging 
(g)
Counterparty, the Eligible Hedging Counterparty will make the relevant payment to 
the Fund on the payment date set out in the relevant transaction confirmation.  
 
Where the Hedging Net Amount is due to be paid by the Fund, the Fund will make 
(h)
the relevant payment to the relevant Eligible Hedging Counterparty on the payment 
date set out in the relevant transaction confirmation but subject to and in accordance 
with the Interest Priority of Payments. 


 
 
 
270 
 
3.4.8.2. 
 Financial Agency Agreement  
The Management Company, on behalf of and for the account of the Fund, will enter into a 
Financial Agency Agreement with the Paying Agent and the Issuer Accounts Bank for the 
financial servicing of the Notes Series, whose main terms and conditions are described in 
section 5.2 of the Securities Note.

Servicing Policies 
Mitigation of default risk via Collections (Recovery) of bad debts. 
Collections/Recoveries policies are reviewed annually (and updated accordingly if any 
change is required during the period), and approved by the Credit Risk Executive. The 
referred policies apply to both securitised and non-securitised Credit Cards.  
The primary objective of collections activity is to rehabilitate the account in arrears in the 
shortest period of time when the contract is not terminated (when the account enters in 
write-off), and to protect the asset once the account enters in permanent block situation 
(from 3 months in arrears onward).  
Collections model separates: 
 
Pre-write-off activity (up to 7 months in arrears), that is carried out by combining 
internal team and external agencies in order to set up benchmarks. 
 
Write-off activity (from 8 months in arrears onward), accounts are sent to external 
collections agencies to recover the asset. Litigation proceedings are started for certain 
accounts at this stage. 


 
 
 
287 
 
When the customer financial situation does not allow to cure the customer, consideration of 
a set of mitigation tools can be offered in order to help to the customer on the repayment of 
the debt. 
In all default cases the Credit Card is automatically blocked (Temporal Block up to 3 
months in arrears; Permanent Block from 3 months in arrears onward) so that no further 
expenditure and increase in the credit risk is possible. 
In addition, Credit Cards entering 4 months in default are reported to Credit Bureaus 
(Asnef/Experian), previously notifying the borrower in compliance with Data Protection 
regulations; accounts are released from Bureau, according to latest March´17 regulation, 
when paid off total debt (if the account is in Write-Off) or rolling back to 1 unpaid 
instalment (pre-write-off accounts). 
       Pre-write-off: Accounts roll and are allocated to separate teams according to 30-day 
default time-frames (“Buckets”). Pre-write-off activity is conducted using a model that 
combines both internal and external agencies according to best trade-off between FTE (Full 
time equivalent) cost, collections results and skills required in each of the segments.  
Accounts are segmented in Low, Medium, High & Very High risk according to the risk 
segmentation models developed by Scoring & Advanced Analytics team for each of the 
buckets, and are reviewed quarterly between Risk and Scorings teams. Risk levels and the 
bucket stage drives collection intensities, contact channels & remedial tool eligibility. 
At Pre-write-off stage, phone collections is the main collections treatment, being also 
complemented for selected segments by letters, SMS, recorded messages, burofax and 
email. 
       Write-off. At this stage, action is taken regarding Borrowers who have missed eight (8) 
or more monthly Instalments, aimed at obtaining a full or partial payment, and focused on 
settlements and payment plans.  
Currently, there are five (5) external agencies managing the recovery stock: two (2) for 
phone collections and three (3) for litigation /bankruptcies.  
Write-off portfolio is segmented per probability of recovery in score ranges, from Score 1 
(highest propensity to be collected) to score 5 (lowest), and refreshed quarterly.  
Phone collections is the main treatment, complemented with letters (for payment reminder 
and settlements campaigns). Litigation is conducted for certain accounts according to 
minimum balance, and payment-contact history; process is conducted by external Agencies 
specialized in legal proceedings doing also phone collections in search of an extrajudicial 
agreement. 
Write-off stock is subject to periodical portfolio sales. 


 
 
 
288 
 
Remedial Tools 
A set of tools is available in order to mitigate losses for customers willing to pay, but not 
able to pay at normal terms. At a certain point, a rewrite can be offered to a customer with 
long term or structural hardship as per collector assessment, and subject to credit sanctioning 
criteria (minimum solvency and income to repay the debt at renegotiated terms). Other tools 
such as late fee waivers and settlements that will be considered as the last option when other 
activities did not success.  
Credit Shield (Payment protection insurance) 
In the event the Borrower has contracted a Credit Shield associated to the Credit Card, 
subject to the presentation of the required documentation, the insurance covers the customer 
debt (up to 3 months in default) in the following situations: a) deceased, b) disability 
(temporary or permanent) or c) unemployment. 
Once the documentation supplied has been reviewed by the insurance broker and the 
fulfillment with coverage requirements has been confirmed, the insurance company pays the 
amounts stipulated according to the Insurance Policy.  
Write-off requirements 
Write-off policy for Credit Cards and rewrites is at 210 days past due (dpd).  
The following events can trigger an “early write-off” before write-off standard calendar: 
 
Bankruptcy 
 
Fraud  
 
Deceased when relatives reject inheritance 
In order to mitigate losses and maximize amount collected, deceased accounts are placed on 
special collections queues in which it is offered to heirs/relatives either settlement at special 
discount or rewrite with heir/relative as new accountholder.  
Governance & Controls 
Risk Operating Committee (ROC) is held monthly between Risk & Collections 
management, covering both pre-write-off & write off portfolios. The following topics are 
included in the Committee: 
 
Review of KPI´s (results, volumes, productivity metrics, intensities) 
 
Adequate staffing levels monitoring. 
 
Collections Strategy execution 


 
 
 
289 
 
 
Champion Challengers & Tests 


 
Ongoing projects and new initiatives 
 
Management of fraud 
The Fraud Prevention Department all fraud-related issues regarding both the origination 
process and the use of the Credit Cards. 
Fraud management is also assisted by the detection tool ("Lynx") which combines a rules 
and a neural engine which considers customer spending pattern at card level. Lynx monitors 
unusual customer behaviours or transactions or which do not correspond to the normal use 
of the card by the customer, including the use of the card in stores considered as high-risk or 
in which there is an increase in the number of fraud cases. The detection tool will generate a 
real-time alert which is reviewed by a fraud analyst in order to verify with the customer 
those suspect transactions by an outbound telephone call or a text message.  
WiZink provides a telephone number available 24 hours any day to allow customers to 
report fraud on his account, Customer Service ensures that the card has been blocked in 
order to prevent further loss, request the necessary documentation and transfer the claim to 
Fraud Department. Customers can also request the cancellation of the card in case of loss, 
theft or any other circumstance which the customer believes may pose a risk. 
Any fraudulent or unauthorised transaction notified by a customer is managed through the 
Fraud Department.

to demonstrate that it has the capability to administer receivables reasonably 
similar to the Purchased Receivables being administered by the Servicer in 
Spain; 
(ii) 
it is willing to enter into an agreement with the parties to the Servicing 
Agreement (other than WIZINK in its capacity as the Servicer) which 
provides for the Replacement Servicer to be remunerated at such a rate as is

commonly charged by providers of servicing services and required to be 
provided by the Servicer and is otherwise on substantially the same terms as 
those of the Servicing Agreement; 
(iii) 
it has obtained and maintains in effect all authorisations, approvals, licences 
and consents required in connection with the Services; 
(iv)

migration of the personal data from the Servicer to the Replacement Servicer, 
including the delivery of all the documentation, records, data files and databases 
related to the Receivables and necessary for a proper servicing. 
The termination of the appointment of the Servicer will become effective as soon as 
the Replacement Servicer being appointed has effectively accepted to start carrying 
out its duties. Until such moment, the Servicer shall continue providing the relevant 
services (as services provider). This should be understood without prejudice to the 
condition of Master Servicer of the Management Company pursuant to article 26.1 b) 
of Law 5/2015. 
The failure to replace the Servicer by a Replacement Servicer within sixty (60) 
calendar days after the occurrence of a Servicer Termination Event shall constitute a 
Revolving Termination Event.  
 
Back-up servicer facilitator  
(d)
Without prejudice to the condition of Master Servicer of the Management Company 
pursuant to article 26.1 b) of Law 5/2015, upon the occurrence of a Servicer

find, select and appoint a Replacement Servicer (also as services provider). The 
Management Company will make its best efforts to find a Replacement Servicer 
within sixty (60) calendar days from the date of the relevant Servicer Termination 
Event.  
The Management Company will ensure that the process of search and appointment of 
the Replacement Servicer is open and competitive, and will take into account, 
amongst others, the following factors in order to ensure that the Replacement Servicer 
is suitable and competent and able to perform the servicing functions in a diligent, 
efficient manner:  
(i) 
it has experience administering receivables reasonably similar to the 
Purchased Receivables being administered by the Servicer in Spain or is able 
to demonstrate that it has the capability to administer receivables reasonably 
similar to the Purchased Receivables being administered by the Servicer in 
Spain; 


 
 
 
306 
 
(ii) 
it is willing to enter into an agreement with the parties to the Servicing 
Agreement (other than WIZINK in its capacity as the Servicer) which 
provides for the Replacement Servicer to be remunerated at such a rate as is 
agreed by the Management Company but which does not exceed the rate then 
commonly charged by providers of servicing services and required to be 
provided by the Servicer and is otherwise on substantially the same terms as 
those of the Servicing Agreement; 
(iii) 
it has obtained and maintains in effect all authorisations, approvals, licences 
and consents required in connection with the Services; and 
(iv) 
it has sufficient resources for the proper performance by it of the Services. 
Once the most appropriate Replacement Servicer has been selected, the formal 
appointment must take place in accordance with the provisions in paragraph c above. 
The replacement servicing agreement should also contain the terms and conditions of 
the migration of the personal data from the Servicer to the Replacement Servicer, 
including the delivery of all the documentation, records, data files and databases 
related to the Receivables and necessary for a proper servicing. 
 
Transfer of monies 
(e)
Upon the effective removal of the Servicer, if the retiring Servicer receives any 
money arising from the Purchased Receivables or otherwise, which money belongs to 
the Fund or is to be paid to the Fund or otherwise, it will hold such money to the 
order and for the benefit of the Fund and will as soon as practicable upon receipt 
thereof and in any case within one (1) Business Day transfer the same to the Fund in 
the Treasury Account. This obligation shall be continuing for the retiring Servicer. 
 
Fees 
(f)
Upon effectiveness of the termination of the appointment of the Servicer by the 
Management Company, the Servicer shall be entitled to receive the part of the 
Servicer Fee accrued up to such date but it shall not be entitled to any other or further 
reimbursement or compensation. The sums so owed to the Servicer shall be paid by 
the Fund on the dates on which they would otherwise have been payable should no 
termination had occurred. 
The costs and expenses related to the process of appointment of the Replacement 
Servicer (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not the remuneration of the Replacement 
Servicer) shall be borne by the retiring Servicer, which shall not be entitled to set-off 
such amount with any amounts due by the Fund to the Servicer. Notwithstanding this, 
in order to avoid any delays, the Management Company, at the expense of the Fund, 
may advance any such costs and expenses and request subsequently their 
reimbursement by the retiring Servicer. 


 
 
 
307 
 
 
Return of Records 
(g)
Upon termination of the appointment of the Servicer by the Management Company, 
the Servicer shall, at its own cost and expense: 
(i) 
as soon as reasonably practicable, provide the Replacement Servicer with the 
information reasonably required in order to effectively transfer the servicing 
functions relating to the Purchased Receivables and to ensure, namely, the 
continued performance of the Priority of Payments and in particular, the 
payment of principal and interest due to the Noteholders; 
(ii) 
as soon as reasonably practicable, deliver and make available to the 
Management Company (or any person appointed by it) the files delivered to 
it by the Seller (if different from the Servicer), copies of all records 
(including, without limitation, computer records and books of records), 
correspondence and documents in its possession or under its control relating 
to the relevant Purchased Receivables and any sums and other assets, if any, 
then held by the Servicer on behalf of the Management Company; 
The Servicer shall execute such documents and take such actions as the 
Management Company may reasonably require for the purpose of enabling 
the Replacement Servicer to comply with its obligations; 
(iii) 
as soon as reasonably practicable, take such further action as the Management 
Company (or any person appointed by it) may reasonably require for the 
preservation of the rights of the Fund on the Available Collections to be 
credited on the Treasury Account; and 
(iv) 
permit the Management Company to accede to, and at reasonable times 
during business hours, any relevant information with respect to the Servicer's 
collection and servicing procedures relating to the Purchased Receivables.  
3.7.3. Notification to the Borrowers and Insurance Companies 
 
The Borrowers and the Insurance Companies shall be notified of the transfer of the 
(a)
Purchased Receivables as soon as practicable: 
(i) 
upon the occurrence of the Servicer Termination Event;  
(ii) 
in any other circumstances where the Servicer, with the prior consent of the 
Management Company, considers such notification necessary or desirable for 
the maximisation of the recoveries under the Receivables or the Insurance 
Indemnifications.  


 
 
 
308 
 
 
In any of the scenarios described above, the Management Company shall be entitled 
(b)
to request the Notary to provide the decoding key of the Encrypted Data File in order 
to be able to access to the data included therein. 
 
The Management Company shall be entitled to notify (or cause to be notified) the 
(c)
Borrowers and the Insurance Companies to make all payments in relation to the 
Purchased Receivables or the Insurance Indemnifications, as applicable, directly on 
the Treasury Account or on any other Fund's substitute bank account held and 
operated by any authorised credit institution having the Accounts Bank Required 
Ratings in the event of the substitution and replacement of the Issuer Accounts Bank 
pursuant to the terms set out in section 3.4.5 of the Additional Building Block. 
 
Any costs and expenses arising from the notification of the transfer of the Purchased 
(d)
Receivables upon the occurrence of a Servicer Termination Event shall be borne by 
the retiring Servicer. Notwithstanding this, in order to avoid any delays, the 
Management Company, at the expense of the Fund, may advance any such costs and 
expenses and request subsequently their reimbursement by the retiring Servicer.  
Regarding such costs and expenses arising from the notification of the transfer of the 
Purchased Receivables according to paragraph (b) above, they shall be borne by the 
Fund. 
 
In addition, if and when the Servicer is requested to confirm or state the capacity in 
(e)
which it is administering and servicing the Purchased Receivables and related matters

WEIGHTED AVERAGE LIFE OF THE NOTES, INTERNAL RATE OF RETURN AND 
ASSUMPTIONS  
To include a table of the results Weighted Average Lives and Internal Rates of Return of each of Class 
of Notes, and the hypotheses and assumptions considered to include exact wording as of the FTs. 
 


 
 
 
383 
 
General 
The yields to maturity on the Class A/B/C20xx-yy Notes will be sensitive to and affected by the 
amount and timing of delinquencies, prepayment and payment pattern, revolving and credit card 
usage, dilution and default on the Purchased Receivables, the level of the relevant interest reference 
rate, the occurrence of any Revolving Termination Events or Accelerated Amortisation Events or any 
Fund Liquidation Events, the issuance of a new Note Series, the occurrence of an Optional Early 
Redemption Event or any Optional Repurchase Event and any other repurchases of the Purchased 
Receivables by the Seller. Each of such events may impact the weighted average lives, the internal 
rates of return, and the Duration of the Class A/B/C20xx-yy Notes. 
Weighted Average Lives and Internal Rates of Return of the Class A/B/C20xx-yy Notes 
The “Weighted Average Life” (WAL) of the Class A/B/C20xx-yy Notes refers to the average amount 
of time that will elapse from the date of issuance of the Class A/B/C20xx-yy Notes to the date of 
distribution to the investor of each Euro distributed in reduction of the principal of such security. The 
Weighted Average Life of the Class A/B/C20xx-yy Notes shall be affected by the available funds 
allocated to redeem the Class A/B/C20xx-yy Notes. 
The “Internal Rate of Return” (IRR) of the Class A/B/C20xx-yy Notes refers to the rate of return that 
makes the net present value of all cash flows (both positive and negative) from the investment in the 
Class A/B/C20xx-yy Notes equal to zero. The Internal Rate of Return of the Class A/B/C20xx-yy 
Notes shall be affected by the available funds allocated to pay interests due on the Class A/B/C20xx-
yy Notes. 
The information included in the tables below assume, among other things:  
 
the Disbursement Date of the Note Series 20xx-yy is ; 
(a)
 
the Scheduled Amortisation Starting Date is ; 
(b)
 
the cut-off date is  which is the Fund relevant Cut-Off Date prior to the issuance of such 
(c)
Notes for which an Investor Report is available /16 June 2017 corresponding to the reference 
date of the Audited Portfolio in the case of initial Note Series issued on the Fund 
Incorporation Date; 
 
that on the Disbursement Date of the Note Series 20xx-yy, the Outstanding Principal 
(d)
Balances of the Purchased Receivables is equal to the Minimum Portfolio Amount which 
amounts to  as of such date. New Receivables are purchased (if required) in order to 
maintain such Minimum Portfolio Amount until the Scheduled Amortisation Starting Date of 
the Note Series 20xx-yy; 
 
that the composition and the amortisation profile of the portfolio of the Purchased 
(e)
Receivables (and the new Receivables purchased during the Note Series Non-Amortisation 
Period of the outstanding Note Series) is similar to the composition and amortisation profile 
of the performing portfolio as at the cut-off date; 


 
 
 
384 
 
 
no new issuance of further Note Series occurs (however for calculation purposes, previously 
(f)
issued and outstanding Notes Series are considered); 
 
the Seller does not repurchase any Receivables purchased by the Fund; 
(g)
 
the rate of defaults on the Receivables is assumed constant at %, which is consistent with 
(h)
the one provided by the Management Company in the latest available Investor Report based 
on the observed performance of the Purchased Receivables as of  which is the Fund relevant 
Cut-Off Date prior to the issuance of such Notes for which an Investor Report is available / 
observed by the Seller in January 2017 as described in section 3.5 of the Base Prospectus (in 
the case of initial Note Series issued on the Fund Incorporation Date); 
 
interest payments on the Receivables will be received, if any at the applicable interest rate 
(i)
offered by WIZINK which as of the cut-off date stand at %. No adjustment of the applicable 
interest rate under the Credit Card Agreements is offered by WIZINK; 
 
the Fund excess margin is constant and sufficient to cover the assumed rate of defaults on the 
(j)
Receivables; 
 
a constant monthly principal payment rate (MPPR). In respect of Class A/B/C Notes, the 
(k)
assumed MPPR is: (i) % in respect of scenario 1; (ii) % in respect of scenario 2; and (iii) 
% in respect of scenario 3, according to the following tables. These scenarios have been 
defined based on the observed performance of the Purchased Receivables as of  which is the 
Fund relevant Cut-Off Date prior to the issuance of such Notes / historic information provided 
by the Seller in January 2017 as described in section 3.5 of the Base Prospectus (in the case of 
initial Note Series issued on the Fund Incorporation Date);  
 
the calculation of the weighted average life (in years) is calculated on an Actual/Actual basis; 
(l)
 
the Note Series 20xx-yy Clean-Up Call Conditions will not be considered applicable;  
(m)
 
none of the Fund Liquidation Events are considered applicable; 
(n)
 
payment of principal and interest due and payable under the Notes will be received on 
(o)
the .. day of each corresponding Payment Date;  
 
zero per cent investment return is earned on the Issuer Accounts; 
(p)
 
no Revolving Termination Event has occurred; 
(q)
 
no Accelerated Amortisation Event has occurred; and  
(r)
 
it is not necessary to use the Commingling Reserve or the General Reserve. 
(s)
The actual characteristics and performance of the Purchased Receivables will differ from the 
assumptions used in constructing the tables set forth below, which are hypothetical in nature and 
provided only to give a general sense of how the principal cash flows might behave under varying 


 
 
 
385 
 
monthly rate of principal payment scenarios. For example, it is unlikely that the receivables will pay 
at a constant monthly rate of principal payment until maturity. Any difference between such 
assumptions and the actual characteristics and performance of the Purchased Receivables, or actual 
monthly rate of principal payment of loss experiences, will affect the percentage of principal amount 
outstanding as well as interest payment over time and the Weighted Average Life and Internal Rate of 
Return of the Class A/B/C20xx-yy Notes. 
Subject to the foregoing discussion and assumptions, the following tables indicate the Weighted 
Average Life, Duration and the Internal Rate of Return of the Class A/B/C20xx-yy Notes under the 
monthly constant principal payment ratio shown and depending on the exercise of the optional 
redemption of the Note Series 20xx-yy on the Note Series 20xx-yy Call Date.
