Furthermore, the Manager shall apply, for the account of the Fund, for inclusion of

The Manager has entrusted an evaluation of the credit risk attached to the Bonds to the

España” or the “Rating Agency”), the Spanish company wholly-owned by Standard & 


UCI 12

Poor’s Rating Services, a rating agency recognized by the Spanish Securities Market 
Commission. 
Rating assigned to the Bond issue.  
Prior to the registration of this Prospectus, S&P España has assigned to the Bonds 
provisional ratings of (P) AAA for the Class A Bonds, (P) A  for the Class B Bonds and (P) 
BBB  for the Class C Bonds (hereinafter, the “ratings”) and expects to assign to the Class 
A Bonds a final AAA rating, to the Class B Bonds a final A rating and to the Class C 
Bonds a final BBB rating prior to the start of the Bond Subscription Period (as described in 
Section II.18.3 of this Prospectus). 
If the Rating Agency does not confirm the AAA, A and BBB ratings of the Class A, B and 
C Bonds, respectively, prior to the start of the Subscription Period, this circumstance shall 
be immediately reported to the Spanish Securities Market Commission and shall be made 
public in the manner contemplated under Section III.5.3, b), b”). 
The non-confirmation of the AAA, A and BBB ratings of the Class A, B and C Bonds, 
respectively, prior to the start of the Subscription Period, would constitute the sole 
circumstance for termination of the incorporation of the Fund and the Bond issue. 
Schedule III to this Prospectus contains a copy of the letter of notification of the 
provisional rating on the part of S&P España. 
Considerations concerning S&P España’s rating. 
The rating scales of S&P Rating Services, used by S&P España for medium and long-term 
debt issues on the one hand, and short-term issues on the other, are as follows:: 
Medium and 
Long-term 
Short-term 
• AAA
• A-1+  
• AA 
• A-1  
• A 
• A-2  
• BBB 
 
• A-3 
• BB 
 
• B 
• B 
 
• C 
• CCC 
 
• D 
• CC 
• C 
• D 
 
The scales AA through CCC for medium and long-term debt may be modified with a + or – 
sign which indicates the relative position within each category. 
S&P España assigns a rating of AAA to debt issues whose capacity to pay interest and to 
redeem principal is extremely strong.  An A rating is awarded to debt issues with a strong 
capacity to pay interest and redeem principal.  A BBB rating is awarded to debt issues with 
an adequate capacity to pay interest and redeem principal, but is more susceptible to being 
affected by adverse economic conditions and, consequently, to having its capacity to 
perform its economic obligations more debilitated than debts ranked higher.  
The rating given by Standard & Poor’s concerning credit risk is an opinion as to the 
capacity of the Fund to meet periodic interest and principal payments throughout the life of 
the operation and, in any case, prior to the Legal Maturity Date of the said Bonds.

The rating does not constitute a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities.  It is an 
opinion not intended to cause potential investors to avoid the need to perform their own 
analyses of the Bonds. 
Ratings may be revised, suspended or withdrawn at any time by S&P España, depending 
upon any information of which it becomes aware.  Such situations, which would not 
constitute events of early redemption of the Fund, shall be immediately reported to both the 
Spanish Securities Market Commission as well as the bondholders, as provided by Section 
III.5.3, b), b”). 
In order to carry out the rating and monitoring process, S&P España confides in the 
accuracy and completeness of the information furnished to it by the Manager, auditors, 
legal counsel and other experts. 
Obligations of the Manager 
The Manager, on behalf of the Fund, agrees to furnish S&P España with periodic 
information on the situation of the Fund and the performance of the Mortgage 
Participations and, outside of the periodic frequency, whenever it is reasonably requested to 
do so and, in any case, when there is a change in the conditions of the Fund, the contracts 
entered into thereby through its Manager, or the interested parties. 
In any case, the Manager shall use its best efforts to maintain the rating of the Bonds at its 
initial level and, in case such rating should fall, to recover the said initial rating. 
II.4 Nature and denomination of securities offered, indicating the number of the issue or 
Class. 
The issue amount shall be Euros nine hundred million (EUR 900,000,000), and shall be 
formed by nine thousand (9,000) Bonds. 
The said face amount is broken down into three Bond Classes: 
(i) Class A: formed by eight thousand six hundred seventy-two (8,672) Bonds and a total 
face amount of Euros eight hundred sixty-seven million two hundred thousand (EUR 
867,200,000). 
(ii) Class B: formed by ninety (90) Bonds and a total face amount of Euros nine million 
(EUR 9,000,000). 
(iii) Class C: formed by two hundred thirty-eight (238) Bonds and a total face amount of 
Euros twenty-three million eight hundred thousand (EUR 23,800,000). 
Classes B and C are placed behind (first in the payment of interest and after, in the payment 
of principal) Class A and also between them, in accordance with the provisions of the order 
of priority of payments, as contained in Section V.5.1, b), 2, of this Prospectus. 
The subscription or holding of Bonds of one Class does not imply the subscription or 
holding of the Bonds of the other Class. 
The said Bonds enjoy the legal status of homogeneous, standardized, fixed income 
securities and, consequently, eligible for trading on organized securities markets. 
II.4.1 Legal scheme of securities, specifying the procedures which guarantee the 
certainty and effectiveness of the rights of their first and subsequent holders.  
Implications on the financial servicing of each one of the Class of securities 
issued against the Fund caused by the required link between the payment 
schedule for principal and interest of the said securities and the flows of 


UCI 12 
Prospectus 
May 2005 
CHAPTER II:  INFORMATION RELATING TO SECURITIES ISSUED AGAINST THE MORTGAGE SECURITIZATION FUND 
 
 
7
revenues and collections coming from the assets subject to securitization 
through the Fund. 
The Bonds to be issued enjoy the legal status of specified-yield, simple fixed 
income negotiable securities. 
As simple fixed income negotiable securities, the Bonds are subject to the legal 
scheme provided in respect thereof by the Spanish Securities Market Act.  As 
detailed under Section II.5, infra, the Bonds shall be represented by book-entries, 
and their transfer shall be carried out through accounting transfer. 
As established by article 11 of Royal Decree 116/1992, the Bonds represented by 
book-entries shall be established as such by virtue of their registration in the 
pertinent accounting record, to be carried in the manner established under Section 
II.5, infra, by Iberclear.  Once the said registration has been carried out, the Bonds 
shall be subject to the rules provided by Title I, Chapter II, of Law 24/1988 and 
Royal Decree 116/1992. 
Certificates of legitimacy of ownership may be issued at the request and exclusive 
expense of a Bondholder, and shall include, apart from the identity of the holder, 
the purpose for which they are issued and the effective period thereof.  The 
provisions of Title I, Chapter I, Section Four of Royal Decree 116/1992 shall be 
applicable for this purpose. 
The Bonds may be freely transferred by any means admitted by Law.  The title to 
each Bond shall be transferred by accounting transfer.  The registration of the 
transfer in favor of the transferee in the accounting record shall produce the same 
effects as the tradition of certificates and from such time, the transfer shall be 
effective and eligible for challenge vis-à-vis third parties.  In this regard, a third 
party who acquires for consideration the Bonds represented by book-entries from a 
person who, as per the entries of the accounting record, appears to have standing to 
transfer them, shall not be subject to challenge, unless at the time of the acquisition, 
there has been bad faith or gross negligence. 
Different frequency between the Fund’s income and payment flow 
Article 5.7 of Law 19/1992 establishes that managers may temporarily acquire 
financial assets of a sufficient quality which do not deteriorate the creditworthiness 
of the Fund’s liabilities, in order to cover any temporary shortfalls between the 
principal and interest flow schedule on the Mortgage Participations and that of the 
Bonds issued.  In this regard, the Manager, on behalf of the Fund, will enter into, 
inter alia, a Guaranteed Rate Reinvestment Agreement to be executed with the 
Bank, by virtue of which the Bank shall guarantee a variable rentability to the 
amounts deposited by the Fund through its Manager in the Cash Account, in the 
terms and conditions described under Section V.3.1 of this Prospectus. 
II.4.2 Other implications and risks which, due to the legal and economic nature of 
the assets pooled into the Fund, could affect the financial servicing of the 
securities issued against the Fund as a consequence of the securitization 
process in respect of the said assets. 
a) Risk of non-payment of the Mortgage Participations. 
The holders of the Bonds issued against the Fund shall be responsible for the 
risk of non-payment of the Mortgage Participations pooled therein.

Consequently, the UCI as Assignor, in accordance with the criteria established 
by article 348 of the Spanish Commercial Code, is liable to the Fund exclusively 
for the existence and legitimacy of the Mortgage Loans, as well as for the legal 
status and standing with which the assignment is made; however, it assumes no 
liability for the non-payment of the debtors, whether principal, interest, or any 
other amount they may owe in accordance with the Mortgage Loans. 
Nor shall it assume in any other manner, any liability in directly or indirectly 
guaranteeing the successful conclusion of the operation, or grant security-
interests or bank guarantees, or incur any repurchase agreements. 
b) Risk of prepayment of the Mortgage Participations. 
The Mortgage Participations pooled into the Fund are susceptible to being 
prepaid when the debtors of the Mortgage Loans prepay the portion of the 
principal pending amortization to UCI. 
The risk such prepayment will represent shall be transferred quarterly, on each 
Payment Date, to the Bondholders in accordance with the amortization rules 
described under Section II.11 of this Prospectus. 
c) Other considerations. 
II.(14.2.c).1 Protection 
An investment in Bonds may be affected, inter alia, by a deterioration in 
general economic conditions which has an adverse effect on the payments 
of the Mortgage Participations baking the Fund’s issue.  In the event that 
non-payment should reach a high level, they could reduce, or even 
eliminate, the protection against losses in the Mortgage Loans portfolio 
enjoyed by the Bonds as a result of the existence of the credit enhancements 
described under Section V.3 of this Prospectus.  Notwithstanding the 
foregoing considerations, the Bondholders have their risk mitigated by the 
order of priority of payments described under Section V.5.1.b)2 of this 
Prospectus. 
II.4.2.c).2 Liability 
The Bonds issued by the Fund do not represent an obligation of the 
Manager or the Assignor.  The flow of funds used to meet the obligations 
triggered by the Bonds is insured or guaranteed only in the specific 
circumstances and up to the limits cited in this Prospectus.  With the 
exception of these guarantees, no others granted by any public or private 
entity, including the Manager, the Assignor and any affiliate or investee 
company thereof, exist.  The Mortgage Participations pooled into the Fund 
and the rights the latter carry with them, constitute the principal source of 
income of the Fund and, therefore, of payments to the holders of its 
liabilities. 
II.4.2.c).3 Liquidity. 
No guarantee exists that trading in the Bonds on the market will come to 
take place with a minimum frequency or volume.  In addition, in no case 
may the Fund repurchase the Bonds from their holders, although they may 
indeed be redeemed in full early, among other circumstances, in case of 
early liquidation of the Fund when the Outstanding Balance of the 


UCI 12 
Prospectus 
May 2005 
CHAPTER II:  INFORMATION RELATING TO SECURITIES ISSUED AGAINST THE MORTGAGE SECURITIZATION FUND 
 
 
9
Mortgage Participations pending amortization is less than 10% of the initial 
balance, in the terms established under Section III.8.1 of this Prospectus. 
II.4.2.c).4 Yield. 
The prepayment rate of the Mortgage Participations may be influenced by 
various geographic, economic and social factors such as seasonal trends, 
market interest rates, the sectorial distribution of the portfolio and, in 
general, the level of economic activity. 
The calculation of the internal rate of return, the average life and the term of 
the Bonds is subject to hypotheses of prepayment rates which may not 
materialize. 
II.4.2.c).5 Several Legal Aspects 
On the Date of Incorporation, the Assignor has made a series of 
representations and warranties, as stated in Chapter IV of this Prospectus.  
They relate, inter alia, to the characteristics of the Mortgage Loans which 
will coincide with what is to be established in the Deed of Incorporation, as 
well as the absence of any obstacle against the issuance of the.  In any case, 
the Assignor does not guarantee the solvency of the debtors of the Mortgage 
Loans. Furthermore, these warranties do not allow the Bondholders to 
exercise against the Assignor any right they may have against the Fund.  
The Manager, in the terms established under Section II.21, infra, is the only 
entity authorized to represent the Bondholders in relations with third parties 
or in any legal proceeding related to the Fund. 
The Assignor, as administrator of the Mortgage Loans, agrees to act with 
the same diligence as if dealing with any other asset existing in its portfolio. 
II.5 Form of representation, denomination and address of entity entrusted with the 
accounting record. 
The Bonds shall be represented by means of book-entries, in accordance with the 
provisions of article five, item 9 of Law 19/1992 and Royal Decree 116/1992.  They will be 
established as such by virtue of their registration in the pertinent accounting record.  In this 
respect, it is hereby stated for the record that the Deed of Incorporation shall take the 
effects provided by article 6 of the Spanish Securities Market Act, so that the deed 
including the representation of the Bonds by means of book-entries shall be the issuance 
deed. 
The Bondholders shall be identified as such as per the accounting record carried by 
Sociedad de Gestión de los Sistemas de Registro Compensación y Liquidación de Valores 
S.A. (hereinafter, “Iberclear”), who shall be appointed as the entity entrusted with the said 
accounting record in the Deed of Incorporation, in such a manner that the clearing and 
settlement of the Bonds may be carried out in accordance with the rules of operation 
Iberclear has established or may approve in the future with respect to securities represented 
by book-entries which are admitted to trading on the AIAF market. 
The following shall be carried in the Central Record for which Iberclear is responsible with 
respect to each participating entity:  a) an account which reflects the balance of Bonds held

the name of third parties.

Mart I”, 28020.

included and numbering thereof, as the case may be, broken down by the various 
Classes of the issue. 
The total issue amount shall be Euros nine hundred million (EUR 900,000,000), to be 
formed by nine thousand (9,000) Bonds. 
The said face amount is broken down into three Bond Classes:

of principal) Class A and also between them, in accordance with the provisions of the order 
of priority of payments, as contained in Section V.5.1, b), 2, of this Prospectus.

II.9 Mention, if applicable, of the existence, as the case may be, of fees for the account of 
holders of the securities issued against the Fund, obligatorily represented through 
book-entries, for registration and maintenance of balance. 
The fee accrued for inclusion of the Bonds in Iberclear’s Central Registry, shall be for the 
account of the Fund.  It is not applicable to collect same.  Furthermore, no fee exists for

administration of securities, as they may freely determine and which, at the appropriate 
time, have been reported to the Bank of Spain and/or the CNMV as the regulatory authority 
in respect thereof. 
II.10 Interest rate clause. 
II.10.1 Nominal interest rate. 
All of the Bonds shall accrue an annual variable nominal interest, to be paid 
quarterly, which shall result from applying the criteria contained below. 
Such resulting interest rate shall be paid quarterly on each Payment Date, as 
described under Section II.10.3, infra, in respect of the Balance Pending Payment 
on the Bonds of each Class (as described under Section II.11.3, b), 3). 
Any withholdings, contributions and taxes established or to be established in the 
future on the principal, interest or returns on the Bonds, shall be at the bondholders’ 
exclusive expense, and the amount thereof shall be deducted, as the case may be, by 
the Manager, acting on behalf of the Fund, in the manner established by law. 
a) Accrual. 
The term of this issue shall therefore be divided into successive interest accrual 
periods (hereinafter, the “Interest Accrual Periods”), comprising the actual 
days existing between each Payment Date described under Section II.10.3 of this 
Prospectus, including in each Interest Accrual Period the initial Payment Date, 
and excluding the Final Payment Date, calculated on the basis of a three hundred 
sixty (360) day year. 
b) Nominal interest rate. 
The nominal interest rate for each Interest Accrual Period accrued by the Bonds 
shall be the result of adding together:  (i)  the reference interest rate of three (3) 
month EURIBOR or four (4) month EURIBOR, the latter for the first interest 
accrual period (hereinafter, the “First Interest Accrual Period”) or, if 
necessary, its substitute, as described under section c), infra, and (ii) the spread 
applicable to each Class of Bonds, as indicated below under section d), all of 
which rounded out to the closest thousandth of one percent. 
c) Determination of EURIBOR (Reference Interest Rate). 
(i) The said rate known as EURIBOR, (Euro Interbank Borrowing Offered Rate), 
is the reference rate of the Euro money market, in deposit transactions at 
three (3) months or four (4) months, the latter for the First Interest Accrual 
Period.  The EURIBOR to be used shall be calculated, distributed and 
published by REUTERS, on page EURIBOR01 (or such other page as may 
come to replace it in this service), at 11:00 a.m. (Brussels time, C.E.T., 
Central European Time) of the Rate Fixing Time described herebelow. 
(ii) In the event of absence of rates as provided by section (i), supra, the interest 
rate resulting from taking the simple arithmetic mean of the interbank 
offered rates for deposit transactions in Euros (EURIBOR), at three (3) 
months or four (4) months, the latter for the First Interest Accrual Period, at 
the Rate Fixing Time provided. by the banks listed below at about 11:00 
a.m, shall apply as Reference Rate:

CHAPTER II:  INFORMATION RELATING TO SECURITIES ISSUED AGAINST THE MORTGAGE SECURITIZATION FUND 
 
 
12
• BNP Paribas, sucursal Londres (London Branch), 
• J.P. Morgan Chase, sucursal Londres (London Branch). 
all of which rounded out to the closest one thousandth of one percent. 
In the event it is impossible to apply the above reference interest rate, 
because one of the aforesaid Banks does not provide, in a continuous 
fashion, a declaration of quotations, the interest rate resulting from applying 
the simple arithmetic mean of the interest rates declared by the remaining 
two banks shall apply, all of which rounded out to the closest one 
thousandth of one percent. 
If one of the two banks mentioned above ceases to provide in a continuous 
fashion a declaration of quotations, the last nominal interest rate applicable 
to the last Interest Accrual Period shall apply throughout successive Interest 
Accrual Periods as long as such impossibility is maintained. 
If two of the Banks listed above should resume quoting, the substitute 
reference rate shall again be applied as per the foregoing rules. 
The Manager shall keep on file the REUTERS screen or, as the case may 
be, the declarations of quotations of the banks mentioned in this section, as 
documents accrediting the EURIBOR rate so determined. 
d) Spread to be applied to the reference rate for each one of the Bond Classes: 
The spread to be applied to the reference rate, determined as specified above, in 
order to calculate the interest rate which the Classes A, B, and C Bonds will 
accrue in each Interest Accrual Period, respectively, shall range between 0.08% 
and 0.18%, both inclusive, for the case of the Class A Bonds, between 0.20% 
and 0.35%, both inclusive, for the case of the Class B Bonds, and between 
0.40% and 0.60%, both inclusive, for the case of the Class C Bonds. 
The definitive spreads applicable to Classes A, B and C respectively, shall be set 
prior to the start of the Subscription Period. Specifically, they shall be set and 
notified to the Manager, on the Date of Incorporation (May 30, 2005) by the 
Lead Managers.  Furthermore, the Manager shall also notify the CNMV as 
additional information.  In the absence of the notice to be made by the Lead 
Managers, the Manager shall set the Class A spread at 0.013%, the Class B 
spread at 0.25% and the Class C spread at 0.50%. 
e) Rate Setting Time. 
The nominal interest rate applicable to all Bond Classes for each Interest 
Accrual Period shall be determined by the Manager, on behalf of the Fund, on 
the second Business Day as per the calendar of TARGET (Trans European

rules of priority in the Fund’s payments are established and, specifically, those 
which affect the interest payments on the said securities. 
The payment of interest accrued on the Class A Bonds ranks second (2nd) place, the 
payment of interest on the Class B Bonds ranks third (3rd) place, and the payment of 
interest on the Class C Bonds ranks fourth (4th) place in the order of priority of 
payments established under Section V.5.1, b), 2, of this Prospectus, unless the 
deferral rules established in the said Section are met.  
 
II.10.3 Dates, place, entities, and procedure for payment of interest. 
Interest on all Bond Classes shall be paid on March 15, June 15, September 15, and 
December 15 of each year, or the immediately following Business Day (hereinafter, 
collectively the “Payment Dates” and each one, the “Payment Date”) until 
amortization in full (all of which through the procedure indicated under Section 
II.12, paragraph one, of this Prospectus). 
In the event that one of the 15th days of the months mentioned above is not a 
Business Day (as described under Section II.10.1, d), supra) the interest payment 
shall be made on the immediately following Madrid Business Day, with interest 
pertaining to the Interest Accrual Period described under Section II.10.1, a), of this 
Prospectus accruing up to the said first Business Day, non-inclusive. 
The first interest payment on the three Classes Bonds shall take place on September 
15, 2005, with more than a complete quarter having transpired from the pay-out of 
the Bonds.  In this case, the interest will accrue at the pertinent nominal interest rate 
from the Date of Pay-out by the subscribers contemplated under Section II.18.5, 
inclusive, through September 15, 2005, non-inclusive. 
The calculation of interest to be paid on each Payment Date for each Interest 
Accrual Period shall be made pursuant to the following formula: 
360
 
d
i ×
×
Ν
=
Ι
 
Where: 
I = Interest payable on a specified Payment Date. 
N = Balance Pending Payment on the Bonds, on the Determination Date pertaining 
to each Payment Date. 
i= Interest rate expressed as a percentage per annum. 
d = Number of days transpiring during each Interest Accrual Period. 
Both interest resulting to the credit of the Bondholders, calculated as provided 
above, as well as the amount of interest accrued and not paid, shall be reported to 
the Bondholders, in the manner described under Section III.5.3, at least one (1) 
calendar day in advance of each Payment Date. 
In the event that on a Payment Date, the Fund cannot make payment on the interest 
accrued by the Bonds pursuant to the order of priority of payments established 
under Section V.5.1, b), 2, the amounts which the bondholders have ceased to 
receive shall be paid on the next Payment Date on which Available Funds exist 
susceptible to being applied for such purpose.  Such deferred sums of interest shall 
accrue to the credit of the Bondholders interest equal to that applied to each Class

Bonds during the Interest Accrual Period(s) through the Payment Date on which 
payment thereof takes place and without this implying a capitalization of the debt. 
The Fund, through its Manager, may not defer the payment of interest on the three 
Classes beyond December 15, 2039 (hereinafter, the “Final Maturity Date” of the 
Bonds), or the following Business Day. 
In order to facilitate the subscriber’s comprehension of the system for setting the 
applicable nominal interest rate, and the amount of interest to be received on each 
Bond on each Payment Date, a practical case is included herein, as well as the 
Theoretical Tables for Financial Servicing of Indebtedness, both in Section II.12, a) 
and b) of this Prospectus. 
II.11 Redemption of the Bonds.

thousand (EUR 100,000) per Bond, equivalent to the face value thereof, free of 
expenses for the bondholder, payable progressively on each Payment Date. 
II.11.2 Simple mention of numerical place in the Fund’s ranking of priority of 
payments occupied by the securities issued thereagainst, and precise indication 
of the section of this Prospectus where the rules of priority established for the 
Fund’s payments and, specifically, those affecting principal payments on the 
said securities, are described. 
The payment of principal on the three Classes Bonds occupies fifth (5th) place in the 
order of priority of payments established under Section V.5.1, b), 2. 
II.11.3 Forms of amortization, specifying the dates, place, entities, procedure and 
public notice thereof. 
a) Final Redemption. 
The Final Maturity Date, and consequent definitive redemption of all Bond 
Classes is December 15, 2039, or the following Business Day, without prejudice 
to the Manager, on behalf of the Fund, and in accordance with the provisions of 
section c), infra, proceeding to redeem this issue early, in which case, the 
Payment Date on which redemption shall take place shall be the definitive 
Redemption Date of the Bonds. 
b) Partial Redemption. 
Notwithstanding the above, the Fund, through its Manager, shall proceed to 
carry out partial redemptions of the three Classes Bonds, in the terms described 
below: 
1. Redemption Payment Dates.

of the Three Classes (and subject to the provisions for the redemption of the 
Class B Bonds, in section 6, infra, and Section V.5.2 of this Prospectus). 
The first redemption payment on the Class C Bonds shall take place on the 
Payment Date on which the Balance Pending Payment on the Class C Bonds 
is greater than or equal to 5.3% of the Balance Pending Payment on all Bonds 
of the Three Classes (and subject to the provisions for the redemption of the 
Class C Bonds, in section 6, infra, and Section V.5.2 of this Prospectus). 
 
2.  Determination Dates; Determination Periods. 
These shall be the dates on which the Manager, on behalf of the Fund, shall 
perform the necessary calculations in order to distribute or withhold the 
Available Funds existing through such dates, in accordance with the order of 
priority of payments described in Section V.5.1, b), 2 of this Prospectus. 
The said “Determination Date” shall be that which corresponds with the fifth 
(5th) Madrid Business Day preceding each Payment Date and shall delineate 
the periods included successively between the said Determination Dates, 
which shall be referred to as “Determination Periods”, including in each 
Period the initial Determination Date, and excluding the final one. 
By way of exception, the first Determination Period shall be the one between 
the Pay-out Date described in Section II.18.5, and the first Determination 
Date. 
3. Balances Pending Payment on Classes A, B and C Bonds. 
These shall be taken to mean the outstanding balance of the Bonds of each 
Class, such balances including the Redemption Amounts Accrued, as 
described, infra, in point 4, on previous Payment Dates, and not paid due to 
insufficient Available Funds, as per the order of priority of payments 
contained in Section V.5.1, b), 2 of the Prospectus. 
4. Redemption Amount Accrued on each Payment Date. 
The Redemption Amounts Accrued on the Classes A, B, and C Bonds, 
without distinction between them, shall be equal to the difference existing, in 
absolute terms, between the Balance Pending Payment on the three Bond 
Classes on the Determination Date prior to each Payment Date, and the 
Outstanding Balance of the Mortgage Participations, having first subtracted 
from the latter a percentage of the principal amount of the Mortgage Loans 
which have experienced lateness in the payment of amounts owed for a 
period greater than or equal to 18 months. 
This percentage shall be determined in function of the time, specified by 
months of delay, in the payment of the amounts owed (T) and of the Loan to 
Value (LTV) ratio in respect of the Mortgage Loan (ML) underlying each 
Mortgage Participation, in accordance with the following rules:

60,000* 25%: EUR 15,000 at 36 months. 
The outstanding balance of the Mortgage Participations (hereinafter, the 
“Outstanding Balance of the Mortgage Participations”), shall be 
composed of both the Principal Amounts Accrued and not collected, as well 
as the Amounts of Principal not yet Accrued and pending maturity. 
5. Liquid amount to be paid as redemption on each Payment Date and 
Redemption Shortfall. 
The Redemption Amount Accrued which may be withheld in fifth (5th) place 
in the order of priority of payments, depending upon the existing liquidity of 
the Available Funds (as described in Section V.5.1 herein) of this Prospectus, 
shall constitute the Available Funds for Redemption. 
On the other hand, the Redemption Shortfall (if any) shall be the difference 
between the Redemption Amount Accrued and the Available Funds for 
Redemption. 
6. Distribution of Available Funds for Redemption among the Bonds of each 
Class. 
The Funds Available for Redemption, coming from the withholding to be 
carried out as per point 5 of the order of priority of payments, shall be 
earmarked towards said redemption, in accordance with the following rules: 
1. Through the first Payment Date (exclusive) on which the Balance Pending 
Payment on the Class B Bonds is greater than or equal to 2% of the 
Balance Pending Payment on all Bonds of the three Classes, the Available 
Funds for Redemption shall be used in their entirety for redemption of the 
Class A Bonds. 
2. On the Payment Date on which the above ratio is greater than or equal to 
2%, the Available Funds for Redemption shall be applied towards 
redemption of both Classes A and B, proportionally between them, in such 
a manner that the said ratio between the Balance Pending Payment on the 
Class B Bonds and the Balance Pending Payment on all Bonds of the three 
Classes shall be maintained at 2%. 
3. On the Payment Date on which the Balance Pending Payment on the Class 
C Bonds is greater than or equal to 5.3% of the Balance Pending Payment 
on all Bonds of the three Classes, the Funds Available for Redemption 
shall be applied towards redemption of the three Classes A, B and C, in 
such a manner that the ratio between the Balance Pending Payment on the 
Class B Bonds and the Balance Pending Payment on all Bonds of the three 
Classes shall be maintained at 2% and the ratio between the Balance

Pending Payment on the Class C Bonds and the Balance Pending Payment 
on all Bonds of the three Classes shall be maintained at 5.3%. 
In relation to the Redemption of the Classes B and C Bonds, and even if all of 
the circumstances contemplated in the above rules are fulfilled, it shall not 
take place if any of the following circumstances should occur: 
(i) that the Outstanding Balance of the Mortgage Participations subject to 
lateness greater than or equal to ninety (90) days on the Determination 
Date immediately preceding the Payment Date in progress is greater than 
or equal to 2% of the Outstanding Balance of the Mortgage 
Participations.  
(ii) that a Redemption Deficit exists greater than 100% of the amount of the 
Class C Bonds, as described above under section 5. 
(iii) that the available amount of the Reserve Fund is less than the minimum 
amount required (as determined in Section V.3.3 of this Prospectus. 
(iv) that the Outstanding Balance of the Mortgage Participations pending 
redemption is less than 10% of the initial outstanding balance. 
In any of the above cases (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) all of the Funds Available for 
Redemption shall be earmarked towards redemption of the Class A Bonds.  
At the time in which none of such circumstances occurs, the redemption of 
Classes B and C shall be re-established. 
Notwithstanding the above, and in the event that on a Payment Date, and as a 
consequence of the order of priority of payments contemplated under Section 
V.5.1, b), 2 of this Prospectus, the Fund does not have sufficient liquidity to 
carry out the said Bond redemption, that is, a Redemption Deficit 
materializes, it shall be added to the amounts which must be paid on the 
following Payment Date for principal redemption, accruing the interest 
pertaining to each Class of Bonds, given that in any case, it shall form part of 
the balance pending payment on the three Classes Bonds, which is the 
amount pending principal redemption on each one of the Bond Classes 
(hereinafter, the “Balance Pending Payment on the Bonds”). 
The Manager shall proceed to notify the Bondholders in the manner 
contemplated under Section III.5.3,a),a”) of the principal redemption amount 
resulting in their favor, the Balances Pending Payment on the Bonds, the 
Redemption Deficit, if any, not paid due to insufficient Available Funds, as 
well as the true prepayment rates in respect of the Mortgage Loans and the 
average residual life of the Bonds. 
c) Early Redemption. 
Notwithstanding the obligation of the Fund, through its Manager, to redeem the 
Bonds on their Final Maturity Date and notwithstanding the provisions of the 
foregoing paragraphs, the Fund, through its Manager, may proceed with the 
early liquidation of the Fund and, consequently, the early redemption on a 
Payment Date of all of the Bonds, in the following cases:  
(i) 
 When the Outstanding Balance of the Mortgage Participations is less than 
10% of the initial balance, provided that the sale of the Mortgage 
Participations pending amortization, together with the balance existing at 
that time in the Cash Account and in the Surplus Funds Account (as 


UCI 12

described in Section V.3.1 hereof), if any, allows for cancellation in full 
of all outstanding obligations to the Bondholders and respecting the 
previous payments to the latter, the order of priority of which ranks as a 
preference as described under Section V.5.1.b).2 of this Prospectus. 
(ii) 
When the provisional rating of the Bonds is not confirmed as definitive 
prior to the start of the Subscription Period 
(iii) 
When due to a change in current regulations in force or the occurrence of 
exceptional circumstances, in the judgement of the Manager, a substantial 
alteration or permanent impairment of the financial equilibrium of the 
Fund takes place. 
(iv) 
Under the circumstance contemplated by article 19 of Royal Decree 
926/1998, establishing the obligation to liquidate the Fund early in the 
event that four (4) months have transpired from when an event 
determining the compulsory substitution of the Manager takes place, 
because the latter is declared in temporary receivership or bankrupt 
(currently, concurso in Spanish), without a new manager being found that 
is willing to take charge of the Fund’s Management; or 
(v) 
When a non-payment indicative of a serious and permanent imbalance 
takes place or is foreseen to take place in relation to any of the Bonds.  
Section III.8 of this Prospectus describes in more detail the circumstances which 
carry with them the early liquidation and termination of the Fund. 
II.12 Table of financial servicing of indebtedness, including both interest payments as well 
as principal redemption, for each Class of Mortgage Securitization Bonds to be issued 
as a charge against the Fund. 
The financial servicing of the Bond issue will be handled through the Bank, which shall be 
deemed, for this purpose, to be the agent bank (hereinafter, the “Agent Bank”).  The 
payment of both interest and principal shall be reported to the Bondholders in the cases and 
as many days in advance as contemplated under Section III.5.3,a),a”) of the Prospectus.  
The said payment of interest and redemptions shall be made against presentation by the 
legitimate Bondholders of the pertinent document accrediting title thereto, or against the 
pertinent certificate issued by the entity entrusted with the Accounting Records, as 
identified under Section II.5 of the Prospectus. 
a)  Practical case illustrating fixing of nominal interest rate. 
In compliance with the provisions of Section II.10.3 and in order to facilitate the 
subscriber’s comprehension of the system for fixing the nominal interest rate and the 
amount of interest to be received on each Class A Bond on each Payment Date, the 
following reflects the form of calculation of said Bonds under the following 
circumstance: 
• 
EURIBOR RATE at three (3) months: 
2.128% 
• Spread (average value of the interval established 
 in Section II.10.1.d), which may differ from the definitive spread).  
 0.13% 
 
                                                                                 ————— 
 
 
2.258% 
• Amount of interest per Bond: 
• 
Interest period per Bond:             92 days (*) 
• 
Balance Pending Payment on Bond:  EUR 100,000 
 


UCI 12 
Prospectus 
May 2005 
CHAPTER II:  INFORMATION RELATING TO SECURITIES ISSUED AGAINST THE MORTGAGE SECURITIZATION FUND 
 
 
20
   100,000  x 2,258 x 92 
———————————— = EUR 577.0444  
              100 x 360 
• 
Rounded out to the closest whole number: EUR 577.04  
 
(*) taking as an example a quarter of such duration, for example, one formed by 
the months of June, July and August. 
Consequently, the amount of interest to be received per Class A Bond would be EUR 
577.04 on a Balance Pending Payment on the Bond of EUR 100,000.  The example 
would be identical for the Class B Bonds, other than substituting the spread of 0.13% of 
Class A for 0.25% of Class B, in such a manner that the interest rate to be applied to 
Class B, would be 2.378% and the interest to be received for each Class B Bond would 
be EUR 607.71 and for Class C the spread to be applied would be 0.50%, whereby the 
interest rate would be 2.628% and the interest to be received for each Class C Bond 
would be EUR 671.60. 
b) Tables of financial servicing of indebtedness. 
The principal characteristic of the Bonds lies in the fact that their periodic redemption, 
and, therefore, their average life and term, fundamentally depends on the speed with 
which the debtors decide to pay off the underlying loans. 
In this regard, any prepayments the debtors decide to make, subject to continuous 
changes, and estimated in this Prospectus by using the future Constant Annual 
Prepayment Rate (hereinafter, “CAPR”), will have a direct impact on the speed in which 
the Mortgage Loans are paid off and, therefore, on the average life and term of the 
Bonds. 
Furthermore, other variables exist, also subject to continuous changes, which affect such 
average life and term of the Bonds.  These variables and their hypothetical values 
assumed in all of the tables appearing in this Section are as follows: 
• interest rate of the Mortgage Participations: 3.98%; 
• default rate on the Mortgage Participations portfolio: 0,60% per annum, 0,05% per 
month, with a 12-month recovery period; 
• charge-offs from the Mortgage Participations portfolio: 0%; 
• that the CAPR holds constant throughout the life of the Bonds; 
• that the Pay-Out Date for the Bonds is  June 2, 2005; 
• that no Redemption Shortfall exists; and 
• that the borrowers do not exercise either the Cuota Comodín missed payment feature 
or the option they have to limit growth of the mortgage payment in function of CPI 
(as described in Section IV.4 of this Prospectus) in light of interest increases on their 
loans. 
Finally, the actual adjusted term of the Bonds will also depend on their variable interest 
rate, and in all of the tables appearing in this Section, this is assumed to hold constant at 
2.258% for Class A, 2.378% for Class B, and 2.628% for Class C. 
Assuming that the issuer will exercise the early redemption option contemplated in 
paragraph one, section c), Section II.11.3 of this Prospectus (i.e. when the Outstanding 
Balance of the Mortgage Participations is less than 10% of its initial amount), the 
average life and term of the Bonds together with the Internal Rate of Return (hereinafter, 
“IRR”), at different CAPR’s, would be as follows:

Finally, the issuer expressly declares that the tables of financial servicing of 
indebtedness described below are purely theoretical and, for illustrative purposes, do not 
represent any payment obligation, subject to a reminder that: 
• CAPR is assumed to be constant at 15% throughout the life of the indebtedness and 
as commented above, the actual prepayment changes continuously. 
• The Balance Pending Payment on the Bonds on each Payment Date and, therefore, 
the interest to be paid on each one, shall depend on the actual prepayment rate 
existing in the Mortgage Loans portfolio. 
• The nominal interest rates on the Bonds are assumed to be constant at 2.2580% for 
Class A, 2.3780%  for Class B and 2.6280% for Class C and, as is known, the 
interest rate on each Class is variable. 
• The hypothetical values mentioned at the beginning of this Section are assumed in 
every case. 
• It is assumed that the issuer will exercise the early redemption option contemplated 
under paragraph one, Section II.11.3,c) of this Prospectus.

II.13 Actual interest contemplated for bondholder, specifying the calculation method 
adopted and the expenses foreseen for concepts appropriate to the true nature 
thereof. 
Actual gross interest for bondholder. 
In the event that the annual nominal interest rates applicable to the three Classes A, B and 
C, variable quarterly, are held constant throughout the entire life of the indebtedness, at 
rates of 2.2580%, 2.3780% and 2.6280%, such rates would translate into IRRs for the 
bondholder of 2.2772%, 2.3993%  and 2.6540% per annum gross, as illustrated by the table 
contained in Section II.12,b) of the Prospectus, given the effect implied by the quarterly 
payment of interest, calculated as an internal rate of return without considering the tax 
impact, and assuming in any case the values and hypotheses which appear in the 
aforementioned Section. 
The calculation of the IRR has been made by using the following formula:  
 
 
Where: 
I = IRR expressed as an annual rate, as a whole number. 
ai = Total amounts of principal and interest to be received by investors (and, in case of 
flows with withholding for the bondholder, the recovery of the relevant annual 
withholding). 
(a1 ................. aN) 
 
ni = Number of days included between the issue Pay-out Date and March 15, June 15, 
September 15 and December 15 of each year (and, in case of flows with 
withholding for the bondholder, the recovery of the relevant annual withholding), 
non-inclusive. 
II.14 Actual interest contemplated by the Fund at the time of the securities issue, 
considering all expenses relating to the design and placement incurred at its expense, 
specifying the calculation method. 
In the event that the variable nominal interest rate on the Bonds holds constant throughout 
the entire life of the indebtedness at a rate of 2.2580% for Class A, 2.3780%  for Class B  
and 2.6280% for Class C, this rate would translate into an actual rate (IRR) for the entire 
issue of 2.4385% for the CAPR of 15%, calculated and assuming the hypotheses mentioned 
under Section II.12, b) as the liquid amount of the issue, after deducting the issue expenses 
from the updated values as at the issue date of all payments for interest, principal and 
cancellation expenses. 
The expenses foreseen are as follows:

charges):

obtained and declared.

Furthermore, it is hereby stated for the record that, notwithstanding the fact that this Bond 
issue, as stated under Section II.18.1 of this Prospectus, is aimed at institutional investors, 
this section covers not only the tax scheme applicable to such investors, but also that which 
would apply to natural persons who could eventually become Bondholders. 
The tax treatment described herein is of a general nature.  Therefore, taxation applicable to 
income obtained through entities under the scheme of attribution of income has not been 
included, nor has the scheme applicable to all categories of investors, some of whom may 
be subject to special rules. 
II.22.1 Natural persons or legal entities resident in Spain. 
a) Individual Income Tax (“Impuesto sobre la Renta de las Personas Físicas”; 
“IRPF”). 
Income obtained by Bondholders holding the status of taxpayers required to pay 
Individual Income Tax (“Impuesto sobre la renta de las personas físicas”; “IRPF”), 
both for the concept of interest, as well as on the occasion of the transfer, 
redemption or amortization thereof, shall be deemed to be passive income obtained 
on the assignment to third parties of owned funds in the terms of article 23.2 of 
Royal Legislative Decree 3/2004, of March 5, approving the Individual Income Tax 
Act, as amended (hereinafter, “Royal Legislative Decree 3/2004”). 
In this regard, in the case of income deriving from the receipt of coupons on the 
Bonds, the full return shall be determined by the gross amount of interest received, 
including interim IRPF withholding which, as the case may be, has been performed. 
In the case of transfer, redemption or amortization of the Bonds, the following shall 
be computed as passive income:  the difference between the transfer, redemption or 
amortization value (less any expenses ancillary to the disposal, provided that they 
are duly justified) and the acquisition or subscription value thereof (plus any 
expenses ancillary to the acquisition, provided that they are duly justified). 
Notwithstnading, any losses arising out of the transfer of the Bonds, which the 
taxpayer has acquired other equivalent financial assets within two months 
preceding or subsequent to such transfers, shall form part of the taxable basis of the 
tax to the extent to which the financial assets which remain in the financial estate of 
the taxpayer are transferred. 
The net passive income shall be determined by deducting from the total income any 
expenses for administration and custody of the Bonds, provided that such expenses 
do not represent consideration for discretionary, individualized management of the 
investment portfolio. 
Net income deriving from the transfer, redemption or amortization of Bonds which 
have remained in the investor’s financial estate for a period exceeding two years 
shall be reduced by 40%.  
Passive income arising out of the assignment to third parties of owned funds is 
subject, in general, to withholding at the rate of 15%.  Notwithstanding the above, 
in accordance with the provisions of article 73.3 f) of Royal Decree 1775/2004, of 
July 30, approving the Individual Income Tax Regulations (hereinafter, “Royal 
Decree 1775/2004”), no obligation to withhold exists in respect of income arising 
out of the transfer or redemption of specified-yield financial assets which meet the 
following requisites (as is foreseen for this issue): 


UCI 12 
Prospectus 
May 2005 
CHAPTER II:  INFORMATION RELATING TO SECURITIES ISSUED AGAINST THE MORTGAGE SECURITIZATION FUND 
 
 
35
1. That they shall be represented by the book-entry system. 
2. That they shall be traded on a Spanish official secondary securities 
market. 
Notwithstanding the above, the following shall be subject to withholding (at a rate 
of 15%):  the portion of the price pertaining to interest accrued when the transfer of 
the Bonds takes place during the thirty days immediately preceding the payment of 
the said coupon, and provided that: 
1. The transferee is a person or entity not resident in Spanish territory or 
is a taxpayer obligee with regard to Corporate Income Tax. 
2. The transferee is not subject to withholding for the explicit returns on 
the Bonds transferred. 
b) 
Corporate Income Tax (“Impuesto sobre Sociedades”; “IS”). 
Income on the Bonds obtained by entities considered to be taxpayer obligees with 
regard to Corporate Income Tax (“Impuesto sobre Sociedades”; “IS”), both for the 
concept of interest as well as on the occasion of the transfer, redemption or 
amortization thereof, shall form part of the taxable basis of Corporate Income Tax 
in the manner contemplated by Title IV of Royal Legislative Decree 4/2004, of 
March 5, approving the Corporate Income Tax Act, as amended (hereinafter, 
“Royal Legislative Decree 4/2004”). 
Generally speaking, such income is subject to withholding for the account of the 
Corporate Income Tax of its recipient.  Notwithstanding the above, in accordance 
with the provisions of article 59 q) of Royal Decree 1777/2004, of July 30, 
approving the Corporate Income Tax Regulations (hereinafter, “Royal Decree 
1777/2004”), no obligation exists to perform withholding on income obtained by 
taxpayers of such tax on financial assets, provided that the following requisites are 
met (as is foreseen for this issue): 
1. That they shall be represented by the book-entry system. 
2. That they shall be traded on a Spanish official secondary securities market. 
In this respect, in accordance with the Order of December 22, 1999, the 
procedure for making effective the exclusion from withholding or interim 
deposit contemplated in article 59.q) of the Royal Decree 1777/2004, with 
respect to interest paid to taxpayer obligees of the aforesaid tax, shall be subject 
to the following requisites: 
1. The Manager, for and on behalf of the Fund, as issuer, shall pay to the 
custodian entities, through the Agent Bank, the net amount resulting from the 
application of the general withholding rate in force on the said date, to the 
total interest. 
2. Prior to the 10th day of the month following the month of maturity of each 
coupon, the custodian entities shall present to the Manager or the Agent Bank 
a detailed list of the holders who are taxpayer obligees of the Tax together 
with their identification data, ISIN code of the securities, the number of 
securities of which they are holders as at the maturity date of each coupon, 
the applicable gross returns and the amount withheld. 
3. The Bondholders shall accredit their status as taxpayer obliges of the 
Corporate Income Tax to the custodian entities prior to the tenth day of the 


UCI 12 
Prospectus 
May 2005 
CHAPTER II:  INFORMATION RELATING TO SECURITIES ISSUED AGAINST THE MORTGAGE SECURITIZATION FUND 
 
 
36
month following the month of maturity of the coupon, in order that the 
custodian entities may prepare the list indicated in the preceding section. 
4. The Manager, as soon as it receives the said list, shall immediately pay, 
through the Agent Bank, to the custodian banks the amount withheld in 
excess to the said taxpayer obligees of Corporate Income Tax. 
5. The custodian entities shall immediately pay the amount withheld to the 
holders who are taxpayer obligees of Corporate Income Tax that have 
accredited such status. 
II.22.2 Natural persons or legal entities not resident in Spain. 
Income obtained by Bondholders holding the status of taxpayers obligated to 
pay Non-Resident Income Tax (“Impuesto sobre la Renta de no Residentes”) 
both for the concept of interest, as well as on the occasion of the transfer, 
redemption or amortization thereof, shall be deemed to be income obtained in 
Spain, with or without a permanent establishment, in the terms of article 13 of 
Royal Legislative Decree 5/2004, approving the Non Resident Income Tax Act, 
as amended (hereinafter, “Royal Legislative Decree 5/2004”). 
a) Income obtained through a permanent establishment. 
Income on the Bonds obtained by means of a permanent establishment in Spain 
shall be taxed pursuant to the rules of Chapter III of the aforementioned Royal 
Legislative Decree 5/2004, without prejudice to the provisions of any 
Conventions executed by Spain for the purposes of avoiding double taxation, 
which may determine the non-payment of the relevant taxes.  The said income 
shall be exempt from withholding for the account of Non-Resident Income Tax 
in the terms indicated above for taxpayer obligees of Corporate Income Tax. 
Consequently, there is no obligation to withhold on income deriving from 
financial assets they obtain, provided that, as is contemplated in this issue, the 
financial assets are represented through book-entries and traded on a Spanish 
secondary official securities market. 
The procedure for applying the exclusion from withholding on interest from this 
type of financial asset is established in the Order dated December 22, 1999 of 
the Ministry of Economy and Finance. 
b) Income obtained without mediation of permanent establishment. 
Income on the Bonds obtained by persons or entities not resident in Spain that 
act, for this purpose, without a permanent establishment in Spanish territory, 
shall be taxed in accordance with the rules of Chapter IV of the above-
mentioned Royal Legislative Decree 5/2004.  The following aspects of such 
scheme are worthy of emphasis, notwithstanding the provisions of Treaties for 
the Avoidance of Double Taxation signed by Spain being able to determine the 
non-taxation of the pertinent income or, as the case may be, the application of 
reduced tax rates: 
• 
The taxable basis shall be quantified at the total amount of the income 
obtained, calculated in accordance with the rules of Royal Legislative 
Decree 3/2004, without the reductions of the said Royal Decree being 
applicable for such purpose. 
• 
In case of transfer, redemption or amortization of the Bonds, the following 
shall be taken into consideration for calculating the income:  expenses

Prospectus 
May 2005 
CHAPTER II:  INFORMATION RELATING TO SECURITIES ISSUED AGAINST THE MORTGAGE SECURITIZATION FUND 
 
 
37
ancillary to the acquisition and disposal, inasmuch as they are adequately 
justified.  Taxation shall be performed separately for each total or partial 
accrual of income subject to taxation, without it being possible to perform 
any netting between the same. 
• 
Income obtained on both the payment of the coupon as well as on the 
transfer, amortization or redemption of the Bonds by persons or entities 
not resident in Spain that act, for this purpose, without a permanent 
establishment in Spanish territory shall be exempt when the recipient is a 
resident of another European Union member State, that is, a permanent 
establishment of such residents located in another European Union 
member State, provided that the pertinent certificate of residency issued 
by the tax authorities of the investor’s country of residence is submitted. 
• 
Likewise, income deriving from the transfer of securities carried out on 
any of the Spanish official secondary securities markets (as is foreseen for 
this issue), obtained by natural persons or non-resident entities, without 
the mediation of a permanent establishment in Spanish territory, who are 
residents in a State which has signed with Spain a Treaty for the 
Avoidance of Double Taxation containing an exchange of information 
clause, shall be exempt.  For such purpose, the pertinent certificate of tax 
residency or equivalent document established by the applicable Treaty or 
rule of implementation, issued by the tax authorities of the country in 
which the investor maintains tax residency, shall be submitted. 
• 
In no case shall the exemptions described in the two (2) foregoing 
paragraphs apply when the income is obtained through countries or 
territories classified by regulation as tax havens. 
• 
The tax shall be calculated by applying to the taxable basis calculated 
pursuant to the rules above the rate of 15%, unless a lower rate or an 
exemption is applicable by virtue of the provisions of an internal rule or 
Treaty for the Avoidance of Double Taxation signed by Spain.  When by 
virtue of the residency of the investor an internal exemption or a Treaty 
for the Avoidance of Double Taxation signed by Spain applies, the 
exemption or, as the case may be, the reduced tax rate provided by the 
above-mentioned Treaty for this type of income shall be applied, provided 
that a certificate of tax residency (which shall expressly establish that the 
investor is a resident, for tax purposes, in the relevent country, as defined 
in the Convention for avoiding the Double Taxation, as applicable) or 
equivalent document established by the applicable Treaty or rule of 
implementation is submitted, in the terms indicated above. 
The above-mentioned certificate shall be issued by the tax authorities of 
the country of residence of the investor, pursuant to Spanish laws, and its 
term of validity shall be one (1) year from the date of issuance thereof, 
Non-resident Bondholders may have income obtained subject to withholding for 
the account of Non-Resident Income Tax, in accordance with the following 
rules: 
• 
The payment of interest on the Bonds shall be subject to withholding for 
the account of Non-Resident Income Tax, except in the cases in which the 
payment of the Tax or eligibility for the exemption is accredited. 


UCI 12

• 
The amount of the withholding shall be, generally speaking, that 
equivalent to the tax payable pursuant to the above criteria, the general 
withholding rate being 15%. 
• 
Nevertheless, pursuant to the provisions of article 10.3.b) of the Royal 
Decree 1776/2004, of July 30, whereby the Non-Residents Income Tax 
Regulations are approved, and the provisions of article 73.3.f) of the Royal 
Decree 1775/2004, no obligation to withhold exists in respect of income 
arising out of the transfer or redemption of the Bonds, since they are 
represented by the book-entry system and are traded on a Spanish official 
secondary securities market, except for the part of the price equivalent to 
the coupon accrued on transfers made within the thirty days immediately 
preceding the maturity of the coupon when (i)  the transferee is a person or 
entity not resident in Spanish territory, or a taxpayer obligee of Corporate 
Income Tax, and (ii)  this income is excepted from the obligation to 
withhold for the transferee.  The above is notwithstanding the joint and 
several liability which the custodian or manager may incur and the 
obligations regarding declaring and paying the possible Tax of the non-
resident Bondholder. 
• 
In cases of the intervention in the procedure for paying interest on the 
Bonds of financial institutions domiciled, resident or represented in Spain 
that are custodians or manage the collection of income on the said 
securities, the procedure for making the carrying out of withholding 
effective at the rate applicable in each case, or the exclusion from 
withholding, shall be carried out as to the interest pursuant to the 
procedure established by the Ministry of Economy and Finance in its 
Order dated April 13, 2000, which is described herebelow: 
1. The Manager, for and on behalf of the Fund, shall transfer, either 
directly or through the Agent Bank, on each interest maturity 
date, to the custodian entities, the net amount which results from 
application of the general withholding rate in effect on the said 
date, to the total interest. 
2. The custodians shall present to the Agent Bank or the Manager, 
prior to the tenth day of the month following the month of 
maturity of the coupon, a detailed list of the Bondholders not 
resident in Spanish territory, without mediation of permanent 
establishment, together with, inter alia, the data relating to the 
Class and maturity date, the ISIN code of the securities, the 
identification of the Bondholders and residency thereof, the 
Number of securities of which it is holder as at the coupon 
maturity date, the relevant gross income and the withholding to 
be carried out. 
3. The non-resident Bondholders shall, in turn, accredit to the 
custodians their tax residency through presentation of a 
certificate of residency issued by the tax authorities of the 
country of residence, having to expressly state, when the 
exclusion from withholding or the withholding is carried out at a 
reduced rate by application of a Treaty, that the investor is a 
resident in the sense defined by the said Treaty, and bearing in 
mind, furthermore, that the said certificate is valid for one (1)

year from issuance.  Notwithstanding the above, when 
withholding is carried out by applying a taxation limit 
Established in a Treaty implemented through an Order 
establishing the use of a specific form, this status shall be 
justified with such form in lieu of the certificate. 
4. The Manager, for and on behalf of the Fund, as soon as it 
receives the list referred to in the preceding paragraph, shall 
immediately transfer, either directly or through the Agent Bank, 
to the custodian entities, the amount withheld from investors 
entitled to apply the exclusion from withholding, or the amount 
withheld in excess of the taxation limits established in the Treaty 
which is applicable with respect to investors entitled to benefit 
therefrom. 
5. The custodians, in turn, shall immediately pay, for the account of 
the Manager, for and on behalf of the Fund, the amount withheld 
or, as the case may be, the excess withholding, to the non-
resident investors. 
In the event of not being able to accredit, for this purpose, a tax residency, 
the income obtained on the Bonds for interest as well as on the occasion of 
the transfer, repayment or redemption thereof, by non-resident 
Bondholders shall be subject to taxation at the general rate indicated 
above, although they may request a refund of any excess withholding Or 
taxation through the procedure and the tax return contemplated in the 
Ministerial Order of December 23, 2003. 
II.22.3 Wealth Tax (“Impuesto sobre el Patrimonio”; “IP”). 
Natural persons subject to this tax by personal obligation who are required to file a 
return for this tax and are holders of Bonds as at December 31 of each year, must 
include them in the Wealth Tax, for which they will be taxed in accordance with 
general rules.  For this purpose, the Bonds shall be computed by their average 
trading value of the fourth quarter of each year which is published annually for such 
purpose by the Ministry of Finance. 
Non-resident natural persons who are Bondholders as at December 31 on each year 
shall be taxpayer obligees of the Wealth Tax by obligation in-rem shall also be 
subject thereto, notwithstanding the provisions of Treaties for the Avoidance of 
Double Taxation signed by Spain.  Notwithstanding the above, residents of other 
European Union countries shall be exempt with regard to Bonds whose income is 
exempt from Non-Resident Income Tax, in the terms set forth above. 
II.22.4 Inheritance/Gift Tax (“Impuesto sobre Sucesiones y Donaciones”; “ISD”). 
The mortis causa transfer of Bonds or gift in favor of natural persons is subject to 
the general rules of Inheritance/Gift Tax, without prejudice to the provisions of 
Treaties for the Avoidance of Double Taxation signed by Spain.  For cases in which 
the beneficiary is a legal entity, the income obtained by the said beneficiary shall be 
taxed in accordance with the rules of Corporate Income Tax or Non-Resident 
Income Tax, as the case may be, without prejudice in this last circumstance to the

The Bondholders shall not be entitled to any action against the Manager except 
for breach of its duties or non-observance of the provisions of the Fund’s Deed 
of Incorporation. 
The Manager, in its tasks regarding administration of the Fund, shall carry out, as 
a matter of illustration, the following actions: 
(i) it shall open in the Fund’s name a financial account (hereinafter, the “Cash 
Account”), initially with the Bank, as long as the Bank’s short-term rating 
does not fall from A-1 (as per the scale of S&P Rating Service detailed in 
Section II.3 of this Prospectus). The short-term rating which the Rating 
Agency has assigned to the Bank at the present time is A-1. 
In the event that the Bank’s short-term debt should undergo, during the life 
of the issue, a decline in its rating, ranking below A-1 (as per the rating scale 
of S&P Rating Service), the Manager shall transfer the Fund’s Cash account 
to a bank whose short-term debt possesses a minimum rating of A-1, and 
shall contract the highest yield possible for the balance thereof, which may 
be different from the one contracted with the Bank, within a maximum 
period of thirty (30) Business Days from the time such situation takes place.  
Consequently, the Bank will cease to carry out the reinvestment at the time 
in which the funds of the Cash Account are transferred to the new bank.  
Such account may subsequently be transferred back to the Bank when its 
short-term debt once again achieves a rating of A-1, as per the scale 
mentioned above (all of which in accordance with the provisions of Section 
V.3.1 of this Prospectus). 
In the event that the sum accumulated in the Cash Account exceeds 20% of 
the Balance Pending Payment on the Bonds, the Manager, on behalf of the 
Fund, shall open a new account at a bank having a rating of A-1+ (the 
“Surplus Funds Account”, as described under Section V.3.1 of this 
Prospectus) into which all such amounts which exceed the above-mentioned 
20% shall be deposited.  In the event that the new bank should lose the A-1+ 
rating, the Manager shall have 30 days to find a new bank with the adequate 
rating.  The Manager shall notify S&P España as far in advance as possible 
of the probability of this event occurring;; 
(ii) it shall verify that the amount of income which the Fund actually receives 
corresponds to the income the Fund should have received in accordance with 
the provisions of the various Contracts from which such income derives, and 
of this Prospectus and the Deed of Incorporation.  If necessary, it shall bring 
such judicial or non-judicial actions as are necessary or appropriate for 
protection of the rights of the Fund and the Bondholders;  
(iii) it shall deposit the amounts it receives from UCI as principal and interest on 
the Mortgage Participations into the Cash Account; 
(iv) it shall deposit into the Cash Account the amount which forms the Reserve 
Fund (as described in Section V.3.3 of the Prospectus) from time to time; 
(v) it shall procure that the amounts deposited into the Cash Account (which 
shall include the Reserve Fund), provided that the Bank’s short-term debt 
maintains at least the rating of A-1 (as per the rating scale of S&P Rating

manner provided by Section III.5.3,a),a”); 
(viii)it shall assign the Available Funds described under Section V.5.1, b), 1, as 
well as any other amount available in the Cash Account and in the Surplus 
Funds Account, if any, on each Payment Date, to meeting the Fund’s 
payment or withholding obligations, in the terms and in the order of priority 
provided by Section V.5.1,b), 2, of this Prospectus; 
(ix) it shall appoint the auditors of the Fund; 
(x) it shall adopt the appropriate decisions in relation to the liquidation of the 
Fund, including the decision to wind-up the Fund early, in accordance with 
the provisions of this Prospectus and the Deed of Incorporation; 
(xi)  it shall manage the Fund in order that its net asset value shall be zero at all 
times; 
(xii) it shall comply with its formal, documentary and reporting obligations vis-à-
vis the CNMV, the Rating Agency, Iberclear, AIAF and any other 
supervisory authority; 
III.3.2 Substitution of Manager. 
The Manager may voluntarily request its substitution, provided that just cause 
exists, by means of a letter presented to the Spanish Securities Market 
Commission.  Such letter shall be accompanied by that from the new, substitute

supra, and specifically, in order that the Fund shall have sufficient liquidity to meet its 
payment obligations, the Manager, on behalf of the Fund, shall carry out any or all of 
the following actions: 
(i) 
sell the Mortgage Participations for a price which may not be less than the sum 
of the principal plus interest accrued and not paid on the Mortgage 
Participations pending amortization.  For this purpose, the Manager shall 
request an offer, from, at least, five (5) entities of the most active in the sale 
and purchase of similar assets, without being able to sell them at a price less 
than the best offer received.  The Assignor shall have a right of first refusal to 
acquire the Mortgage Participations, under the conditions established by the 
Manager at the time of the liquidation, so that the Assignor will have a 
preferential right towards third parties to acquire the Mortgage Participations.  
In order to exercise the right of first refusal, the Assignor shall be given a 
period of five (5) Business Days from the date on which the Manager notifies it 
of the conditions (price, form of payment, etc.) pursuant to which the disposal 
of the Mortgage Participations will proceed. The Assignor’s offer shall be, at 
least, equivalent to the best of the third parties’ offers. 
In the event that no offer would cover the aggregate of the principal plus the 
interest accrued and unpaid for the Mortgage Participations pending 
redemption, the Manager shall gather from among the five (5) entities 
aforementioned, three (3) entities that, in the Manager’s opinion, can give a 
market value. The Manager is required to accept the best offer received for the 
Mortgage Participations which, in the Manager’s opinion, covers the market 
value thereof. In order to fix the market value, the Manager may request as 
many valuation reports as it deems necessary. In this case, the Assignor shall

CHAPTER III: GENERAL INFORMATION CONCERNING THE MORTGAGE SECURITIZATION FUND 
 
54
also have the pre-emption right described above, provided that the Assignor’s 
offer is, at least, equivalent to the best of the third parties’ offers. 
This right of first refusal in no case implies a covenant or declaration regarding 
the repurchase of the Mortgage Participations on the part of the Assignor. 
(ii) 
cancel those contracts which are not necessary for the liquidation process of the 
Fund.; and/or 
(iii) 
in the event that the actions above were not sufficient or there were any 
remaining assets, proceed to sell the remaining assets still within the Fund’s 
assets. The Manager shall be entitled to accept such offers that, in the 
Manager’s opinion, cover the market value of the relevant asset and pay cash. 
In order to fix the market value, the Manager may request as many valuation 
reports as it deems necessary. 
The Manager shall immediately apply all sums it has obtained on the disposal of the 
Mortgage Participations towards payment of the various concepts, in the form, amount 
and order of priority as applicable, as determined under Section V.5.1.b).2 of this 
Prospectus.  The early redemption of all of the Bonds in any of the cases contemplated 
under Section II.11.3.c), supra, shall be carried out for the Balance Pending Payment of 
the Bonds up to that date plus interest accrued and not paid since the last Payment Date 
through the early redemption date, which shall necessarily coincide with a Payment 
Date, after deducting, as the case may be, any tax withholding, and shall be free of 
expenses for the holder, which amounts, for all legal purposes, shall be deemed to be 
due and payable on this latter date. 
In the event that, once the Fund has been wound-up and all payments made pursuant to 
the order of priority of payments established under Section V.5.1.b).2 of this 
Prospectus, any remainder exists or any judicial or notary public proceedings brought 
as a consequence of the non-payment, by the borrowers of the Mortgage Loans, should 
remain pending (all in accordance with the provisions of Section IV.2, b), b’) of this 
Prospectus), both the said remainder as well as the continuation and/or proceeds from 
the resolution of the proceedings cited above shall stand to the credit of the Bank. 
In any case, the Manager, acting for and on behalf of the Fund, will not proceed with 
the termination of the Fund until the liquidation of the Fund’s remaining assets and the 
distribution of the Fund’s available funds have not been carried out, in following the 
order of priority of payments contemplated under Section V.5.1.b).2. 
Once a maximum deadline of six (6) months has elapsed from the liquidation of the 
Fund’s remaining assets and the distribution of the available funds, the Manager shall 
execute a notarized document declaring (i)  the Fund terminated, as well as the causes 
contemplated in the Deed of Incorporation and this Prospectus which motivated the 
termination of the Fund, (ii)  the procedure for notifying Bondholders and the CNMV 
carried out, and (iii)  the distribution of the Fund’s available amounts in following the 
order of priority of payments stated under Section V.5.1.b).2 of this Prospectus, and 
will comply with such further administrative formalities as deemed appropriate.  The 
said notarized document shall be forwarded by the Manager to the CNMV. 
In the event that there are grounds for liquidation, as provided for under section 
III.8.1.(ii) above, the incorporation of the Fund, the issue of the Bonds and the 
agreements entered into by the Manager, acting on behalf of the Fund, excluding the 
Subordinated Loan Agreement, pursuant to which the incorporation and issuance

provided to the CNMV, Iberclear and the Rating Agency.

In following the provisions of Royal Decree 685/82, on Regulation of the Mortgage 
Market, as amended by Royal Decree 1289/91, the Mortgage Participations shall be 
transferable by means of a written declaration in the same certificate and, in general,

address of the new holder shall be notified by the transferee to UCI. 
The transferor shall not be liable for the solvency of UCI or of any debtor of the

securing it. 
On the Incorporation Date, UCI is the beneficiary of the damage insurance 
agreements executed by the mortgage debtors in connection with the mortgaged 
estates, up to the amount of that insured, and UCI is responsible for issuing any notice 
it may be required to under the terms of the executed insurance premiums. 
In case of non-payment by the debtor of the premium on the damage and fire 
insurance on the mortgage guarantees, UCI, as mortgage creditor, assumes that 
payment of such premium by insuring the properties through a Group Insurance 
Policy with an Insurance Company, once it has been made aware of such non-
payment by the said Insurance Company.  UCI shall pay on his behalf and shall debit 
the account of the said debtor, for the amount of the above-mentioned premium, in 
such a manner that they will always be paid. 
In the same act as the incorporation of the Fund, UCI shall assign to the Manager, on 
behalf of the Fund, the rights vested in it as beneficiary of the said damage insurance 
contracts.  Therefore, the Manager, on behalf of the Fund, shall be entitled to all 
amounts UCI would have been entitled to receive for this concept. 
The assignment shall comprise both the transfer of any guarantees that may have been 
established as a guarantee for the granted loan and other additional rights, as 
explained below. 
Rights conferred upon Fund as a consequence of subscription of the Mortgage 
Participations. 
The Fund, as holder of the Mortgage Participations, shall hold the rights they 
incorporate.  Specifically, it shall be entitled to receive all payments which, as from 
the Pay-Out Date, are made by debtors as well as any other payment arising out of the 
Mortgage Loans.  in addition to the payments made by the debtors for principal and 
interest on the Mortgage Loans, the Fund shall be entitled to any other payment the 
Assignor receives for the Mortgage Loans, including those arising out of any 
ancillary right to the financing transactions, such as indemnities from insurance 
policies, payments made by possible guarantors, etc., with the exception of 
commissions 
for 
claiming 
unpaid 
payment 
orders, 
subrogation 
fees, 
prepayment/cancellation fees, as well as any other fee Or outlay to which the 
Assignor is entitled. 
The subscription of the Mortgage Participations shall take full effect between the 
parties as from the Date of Incorporation.  Nevertheless, the accrual of interest in 
favor of the Fund shall take place as from the Pay-Out Date.  The deed of 
incorporation of the Fund includes as SCHEDULE X a copy, on machine-readable 
media, of each and every one of the Mortgage Loans underlying the Mortgage 
Participations pooled into the Fund. 
The rights of the Fund resulting from the subscription of the Mortgage Participations 
are linked to the payments made by the debtors of the Mortgage Loans and, therefore,

are directly affected by the evolution, delays, advances or any other incident in 
respect thereof. 
Payments made to the Manager, on behalf of the Fund, as interest on the Mortgage 
Loans shall not be subject to withholding as established by article 59.k) of the Royal 
Decree 1777/2004. 
d) Rules contemplated for substitution of Mortgage Participations. 
In case of prepayment of the Mortgage Participations initially pooled, as a 
consequence of the prepayment of the relevant underlying Mortgage Loans, no 
substitution of Participations will take place. 
In the event it should be detected, at a time subsequent to the Date of Incorporation, 
that a Mortgage Participation does not meet, on the Date of Incorporation, the 
conditions and characteristics contained in Section IV.1, a) of the Prospectus, because 
the underlying Mortgage Loan does not meet them, UCI agrees to immediately 
proceed with the substitution of the Mortgage Participation in such situation, subject 
to the following rules:  
1. The substitution by UCI (which in any case shall be made for principal plus 
interest accrued and not paid) shall be made through the issuance of Mortgage 
Participation(s) on mortgage loan(s) of its portfolio having characteristics 
homogeneous to the Mortgage Loan underlying the Mortgage Participation subject 
to substitution in function of outstanding principal, term, interest rate, 
characteristics of debtor or characteristics of mortgaged property, as well as 
creditworthiness in terms of the existing ratio between outstanding balance of the 
Mortgage Participation and the Appraisal value of the property serving as security 
for the underlying Mortgage Loan, in such a manner that the financial equilibrium 
of the Fund shall not be affected by the substitution. 
In the event that no Mortgage Loans exist in UCI’s portfolio, having 
characteristics homogeneous to the Mortgage Loan underlying the Mortgage 
Participation subject to substitution, UCI shall proceed to the repurchase thereof. 
2. The substitution shall be carried out in the following manner: 
2.1. UCI shall inform the Manager, on behalf of the Fund, of the existence of each 
non-suitable Mortgage Participation, proceeding to immediately cancel the 
said Mortgage Participation through the pertinent stamping of the certificate 
duly broken down for such purpose, and to issue another Mortgage 
Participation having similar characteristics of residual term, interest rate, 
outstanding principal and creditworthiness in terms of the ratio between the 
said outstanding balance of the participation, and the appraised value of the 
property securing the underlying Mortgage Loan, once a verification, prior to 
the substitution, of the suitability of the substitute mortgage loan has been 
carried out by an outside auditor, in accordance with the provisions of Section 
I.3 of this Prospectus, in such a manner that the financial structure of the Fund 
shall not be affected by the substitution. 
2.2. The said issuance of Mortgage Participation by UCI and substitution by the 
Manager, on behalf of the Fund, shall be made through the execution of the 
pertinent notarial record which shall reflect the data relating to both the 
Mortgage Participation to be substituted and the Mortgage Loan underlying 
the same, as well as the new Mortgage Participation issued, with the data of 
the Mortgage Loan, as well as the reason for the substitution and the indices

for any damage, loss or expense Incurred by the latter as a consequence of the

occurrence of events that, in the Manager's opinion, imply any damages or risk 
for the balance of the Fund's financial structure or the rights and interest of the 
Bondholders, the Manager may directly appoint a new servicer of the Mortgage 
Loans or, if appropriate, request UCI to delegate the fulfillment of such 
obligations to any other bank UCI may deem appropriate for the purposes. Such

due under the relevant Mortgage Loans and shall proceed to deposit the said 
amounts which pertain to the Fund immediately and, in any case, within a period 
not to exceed forty-eight (48) hours, into the Cash Account described under 
Section V.3.1 of this Prospectus. 
Furthermore, UCI shall pay into the said account and within the same time 
period the amounts it receives, as the case may be, from debtors for prepayment 
of the Mortgage Loans and which pertain to the Fund in the terms contemplated 
in this Section. 
In the event that UCI is declared in liquidation, temporary receivership, 
bankruptcy or creditors’ proceedings (in accordance with the provisions of Law 
22/2003), in accordance with the provisions of Section II.15, the Bank shall hold 
the Fund harmless against any damages which may result for the latter from the 
breach by UCI of its obligation in respect of management and servicing of the 
Mortgage Participations and, specifically, it shall proceed to directly pay to the 
Fund, the amounts pertaining thereto for principal and interest on the Mortgage 
Participations forming its assets. 
10. Calculation of interest rate on the Mortgage Loans subject to a variable 
interest rate. 
UCI shall calculate the variable interest rate of the Mortgage Loans subject to a 
variable interest rate, in accordance with the provisions of the loan agreements, 
and shall notify the mortgage debtors, within the time periods contemplated in

which diminishes the ranking, legal effectiveness or economic value of the 
guarantees or of the Mortgage Loans. 
Notwithstanding the above, the Manager may, in exceptional circumstances, in 
order to avoid the costs and uncertainties which any mortgage foreclosure 
Process carries with it and maintain the financial equilibrium of the Fund and, in 
any case, in acting for the benefit of the interests of the Bondholders, in its 
capacity as manager of third-party businesses, give instructions to UCI, or to 
previously authorize the latter, to agree to with the debtor the terms and 
conditions it deems appropriate, in consideration of Law 2/1994 on subrogation 
and modification of mortgage loans. 
UCI will not permit with the mortgage debtors any other renegotiation on the 
financial conditions of the Mortgage Loans, except as mentioned above and as 
expressly mentioned below under Section IV.4 (Cuota Comodín missed payment 
feature and limitation of payment amount as per CPI). 
If for market reasons, or any other circumstance, the value of the mortgaged 
asset decreases from the initial appraise by more than the percentages legally 
permitted, UCI shall demand from the mortgagor debtor, through accreditation 
by means of an appraisal performed at its request, the extension of the mortgage 
to other sufficient assets in order to cover the ration between the value of the 
asset and the amount of the loan secured by such asset. 
If the debtor, after being requested to carry out the extension, chooses to repay 
all or part of the Mortgage Loan which exceeds the amount resulting from 
applying to the updated appraisal the percentage used for initially determining 
the loan amount, UCI shall be required to deposit, in the terms contemplated in 
Section IV.1, c), the amounts it receives from the debtor for such concepts in 
favor of the Manager, on behalf of the Fund, into the Cash Account opened by 
the Manager in the name of the Fund, as described in Section V.3.1 of this 
Prospectus. 
If, within a period of two (2) months from being requested to arrange the 
extension, the mortgage debtor has not arranged it or repaid the part of the 
Mortgage Loan referred to in the above paragraph, he shall be deemed to have 
chosen repayment of the entire Loan, which shall be immediately demanded 
therefrom by UCI.  Once the amount pertaining to the entire Mortgage Loan has 
been received, UCI, in the terms contemplated in Section IV.1, c), shall 
immediately deposit in favor of the Manager, on behalf of the Fund, the portion 
to which it is entitled in accordance with the provisions of the above paragraph. 
13. Remuneration to UCI 
UCI, as consideration for the servicing of the Mortgage Loans (or the entity 
which substitutes it in such servicing task, if possible due to circumstances which 
may occur at UCI, and which may impede or make difficult the proper 
implementation of said servicing), shall be entitled to receive on each Payment 
Date, and through the Payment Date on which the total redemption of the Bonds 
takes place, a fixed Servicing Fee of Euros six thousand (EUR 6,000) (VAT 
included). 
If the Fund, through its Manager, because it lacks sufficient liquidity, does not 
pay on a Payment Date the entire fee owed, the amounts not paid shall

CHAPTER IV: INFORMATION ON CHARACTERISTICS OF ASSETS SECURITIZED THROUGH THE FUND 
 
- 66 -
accumulate without penalty to the fee to be paid on the following Payment Date, 
with payment thereof being made at that same time. 
Furthermore, UCI, as remuneration or compensation for the financial mediation 
process carried out, shall be entitled to receive, on each Payment Date, a 
subordinated, variable amount equal to the difference between the accounting 
income and expenses for the Fund on each Determination Date, in such a manner 
that the financial margin obtained is removed. This amount shall not be deemed 
to be consideration due for the delivery of a good or provision of a service to the 
Fund, but rather will be deemed to be remuneration for the financial mediation 
process carried out by UCI. 
In the event that on one and the same Payment Date (with respect to the period 
running between such Payment Date and the previous one) more than 7% of the 
borrowers have exercised the right to limitation of payment amount as per the 
CPI, the payment of item 13 of the order of priority of payments described in 
Section V.5.1 of this Prospectus referring to the quarterly payment to UCI of a 
variable amount as remuneration or compensation for the financial mediation 
process shall be suspended.  In such case, the said amount would be deposited 
into the Cash Account until the Payment Date on which the exercise of the the 
limitation of payment amount as per CPI pertaining to the new period do not 
exceed the above-mentioned percentage.  The payment of the said fee may only 
be made in restitution subject to agreement with the Rating Agency.  The 
calculation of the said percentage shall be made on the Determination Dates. 
Both the fixed fee for Servicing the Mortgage Loans, to be paid to UCI, as well 
as the amount to be paid thereto as consideration for its financial mediation 
work, shall be paid, respectively, provided that the Fund has sufficient liquidity 
and in accordance with the provisions of Section V.5.1, b), 2, of the Prospectus. 
Furthermore, UCI, on each Payment Date, shall be entitled to reimbursement of 
exceptional expenses it has incurred on the occasion of mortgage foreclosure 
and/or sale of properties, and subject to justification thereof in relation to the 
management of the Mortgage Loans.  The said expenses shall be paid provided 
that the Fund has sufficient liquidity and in accordance with the provisions of 
Section V.5.1,b), 2,a),1 of the Prospectus in relation to the order of priority of 
payments. 
b) Powers of holder of Mortgage Participations in case of breach of obligations by 
the mortgage debtor. 
b') Foreclosure against mortgage debtors. 
UCI shall apply the same diligence and procedures to claim amounts due and not 
paid on the Mortgage Loans as if dealing with the remainder of the loans in its 
portfolio.  Especially, it shall bring the pertinent foreclosure suit if, having 
exhausted the internal time periods for actions aimed at obtaining payment 
satisfactory to the interests of the Fund, they have not yielded the effect pursued.  
In any case, it shall bring the said foreclosure if the Manager, on behalf of the 
Fund, and after analyzing the specific circumstances of the case, deems, in 
accordance with UCI, appropriate. 
In addition, UCI is required to report daily to the Manager, on behalf of the Fund, 
any non-payments, prepayments and interest rate changes; and promptly any 
payment demands, attestable notices to debtors, judicial suits, and any other

circumstance affecting the Mortgage Loans.  Furthermore, UCI shall furnish the 
Manager with all documentation the latter may request of it in relation to the said 
Mortgage Loans and, especially, the necessary documentation in order that the 
Manager, as the case may be, may bring judicial suits. 
In the event of non-payment by a mortgage debtor, the Fund, through its Manager, 
shall have the following powers in accordance with the provisions of article 66 of 
Royal Decree 685/1982, of March 17, as amended by Royal Decree 1289/91, of 
August 2: 
(i) To compel UCI to bring mortgage foreclosure. 
(ii) To participate, pursuant to equal rights with UCI, in the foreclosure brought 
by the latter against the debtor, appearing for such purpose in any foreclosure 
proceeding brought by the former, and sharing in the proceeds of the award 
on a prorated basis pursuant to its percentage in the foreclosed loan. 
(iii) If UCI does not bring the proceeding within sixty (60) calendar days from the 
notarial demand for payment of the debt, for the case of the Mortgage Loans, 
the Manager, on behalf of the Fund, shall have standing on a subsidiary basis 
to bring a foreclosure suit in respect of the investee loan in the amount 
pertaining to the percentage of its share, for both principal and interest. 
(iv) In case the proceeding brought by UCI is halted, the Fund, duly represented 
by the Manager, may subrogate in the position of the former and continue the 
foreclosure proceeding with no need for the above-mentioned time period to 
lapse. 
In the cases contemplated under paragraphs (iii) and (iv), the Manager, on behalf 
of the Fund, may request that the competent Judge bring or continue with the 
pertinent mortgage foreclosure proceeding, attaching to its complaint the original 
certificate of the pertinent Mortgage Participation, properly broken down, the 
notarial formal demand contemplated under section (iii), supra and the 
Registration Certification of recording and survival of the mortgage, as well as a 
document accrediting the balance claimed. 
If legally necessary, and for the purpose of article 681 et seq. of Law 1/2000, of 
January 7, Spanish Civil Procedure Act, UCI shall grant in the Deed of 
Incorporation an irrevocable power of attorney, as ample and sufficient as is 
required by Law, in order that the Manager, acting for and on behalf of UCI, may 
make a notarial formal demand to the mortgage debtor of any of the Mortgage 
Loans for payment of his debt. 
The Manager may also participate, with rights equal to those of UCI, in the 
foreclosure proceeding and, in this regard, it may, with respect to the Mortgage 
Loans, in the terms contemplated by Law 1/2000, of January 7, Spanish Civil 
Procedure Act, petition to be awarded the mortgaged property in payment of its 
debt.  The Manager shall proceed with the sale of any properties so awarded in the 
shortest timeframe possible pursuant to arm’s length market conditions.   
b")Attachment suit against UCI. 
The Manager, on behalf of the Fund, shall be entitled to bring an attachment suit 
against UCI, when the breach of the payment obligation is not a consequence of 
the non-payment by debtors of the Mortgage Loans.

Once the Mortgage Loans have been cancelled, the Fund, through its Manager, 
shall preserve suit against UCI until the full performance of its obligations. 
c) Liability assumed by the Assignor. 
The risk of non-payment of the Mortgage Participations shall be the responsibility of 
the Bondholders.  Therefore, UCI shall not assume any liability for non-payment by 
the mortgage debtors, whether for principal, interest or any other amount they may 
owe under the Mortgage Loans underlying the Mortgage Participations. 
IV.3 UCI’s policy for granting mortgage loans. 
UCI warrants to the Manager that the data contained in this Section are valid and 
faithfully conform to reality, the criteria contained below having been followed in the 
granting of each and every one of the Mortgage Loans. 
IV.3.1 Description of the procedures established by the assignor for risk analysis 
and granting of mortgage loans (“Internal Memorandum”). 
Introduction. 
The basic documentation, generally used studying the transaction, is as follows: 
1. Application form. 
2. Regarding the home to be acquired: documentation submitted by applicant 
regarding the residence to be financed or regarding any other residence 
submitted as additional security for the transaction. 
3. Regarding applicant’s income: 
• 
Salaried employees: last three payroll stubs and last year’s Income Tax 
Return.  
• 
Professionals/independent contractors: last year’s Income Tax Return. 
Authorities. 
The commercial agencies have no decision-making power.  Therefore, the risk 
analysts of the National Authorization Center (N.A.C.) are the ones who verify 
all of the documentation, recalculating income, consulting the risk databases and, 
depending upon powers of attorney, either deciding directly or presenting the 
transaction to the N.A.C. Committee or the Risk Committee, as appropriate.  
Evaluation. 
In making use of his/its authorities, the one deciding on the transaction (analyst, 
N.A.C. Committee or Risk Committee) evaluates that loan and issues a 
preliminary provisional authorization conditioned upon the firm appraisal to be 
performed on the assets to be mortgaged by Valtecnic Appraisal Company and 
on the verification of the registration data by the administrative processors who 
collaborate with UCI. 
The following basic criteria are taken into consideration in making the decision: 
• Purpose of loan:  acquisition or rehabilitation of residence. 
• Borrowers: Natural persons, of legal age, residents of Spain who are 
purchasing their home and who meet the following conditions: 
 
The professional stability of the applicant is analyzed, considering both 
the form of hiring, as well as professional dynamics.  Transactions with 


UCI 12 
Prospectus 
May 2005 
CHAPTER IV: INFORMATION ON CHARACTERISTICS OF ASSETS SECURITIZED THROUGH THE FUND 
 
- 69 -
insufficient stability are reinforced through bank guarantees or 
additional security. 
 
The maximum financing percentage depends on the type of employment 
contract.  Generally speaking, the maximum is 70% for professionals 
and 60% for independent contractors.  These percentages may be 
exceeded in the case of salaried employees.  In the case of civil servants, 
the financing percentage may reach 105% (distributed 80% in a 
mortgage loan and the remainder in an associated personal loan). 
 
The selection process is supported by a statistical score based on the 
probability of non-payment in function of the customer’s profile and an 
expert system which validates that the transaction meets all of the rules 
of UCI’s acceptance policy. 
 
In all transactions, the presence of the borrowers and guarantors, if any, 
in the risk databases of ASNEF (Asociación Nacional de Entidades de 
Financiación – National Association of Financing Entities) is 
systematically checked.  If necessary, the CIRBE (Central de 
Información de Riesgos del Banco de España – Bank of Spain Central 
Risk Information Database) is also consulted. 
Loan funding. 
Once the definitive evaluation and authorization formalities have been 
completed, the signature of the loan deed takes place before a Notary Public, at 
which time UCI funds the loan.  If the financing percentage awarded with respect 
to the appraised value of the collateral exceeds 80%, the delivery of funds would 
normally be made in two tranches: 
- 1st tranche: up to 80%, under the form of a Mortgage Loan. 
- 2nd tranche: the excess over 80%, under the form of a second Mortgage Loan 
or Personal Loan, as the case may be.  These transactions, if they meet the 
requirements established by the insurance company, shall be backed by 
credit insurance which covers the percentage between 80% and 97%.  This 
credit insurance is formally instrumented with General Electric Mortgage 
Insurance. 
If there are any liens prior to the loan, the representative appointed by UCI takes 
care of canceling them, withholding for this purpose the necessary funds, and 
ensures the entire recording process, until UCI’s mortgage is recorded as a first 
mortgage. 
IV.3.2 Statistical information on number of outstanding transactions, net lending, 
average APR and non-performing loans of the portfolio of Mortgage Loans. 
The following table shows the evolution in the last three years of the net lending 
in millions of Euros, average return (APR), together with non-performing loans 
of UCI’s portfolio (as per Bank of Spain criteria) pertaining to mortgage loans 
granted to individuals for the acquisition of residences in Spain:

In relation to the experience in prepayments existing in residential mortgage 
loans granted by UCI at a variable rate, the Annual Constant Prepayment Rate 
(ACPR) existing since origination is around 15% per annum.  These data may 
not be established as an estimate of true future prepayments. 
IV.4 Description of portfolio of Mortgage Loans mobilized through the Mortgage 
Participations pooled into the Fund. 
UCI warrants to the Manager that the data contained in this Section are accurate and 
faithfully conform to reality, and assumes all liability for the inaccuracy thereof. 
Homogeneity of Mortgage Loans 
The Mortgage Loans which back the Mortgage Participations pooled into the Fund have 
been granted to individuals for the sole purpose of financing the acquisition or 
rehabilitation of residences in Spain, as per the market’s standard criteria for analysis 
and granting, whereby they may be considered homogeneous. 
Portfolio of Mortgage Loans  
The portfolio of Mortgage Loans which shall serve as a basis for the issuance of 
Mortgage Participations is formed by 9,044 mortgage Loans, the principal value of 
which, as at April 22, 2005, amounted to EUR 1,049,012,750.75. 
The characteristics of the portfolio as at April 22, 2005 are detailed below: 
Eighty-eight percent of the Mortgage Loans are subject to a variable interest rate, 12% 
have a fixed interest rate the first three years and the rest at a variable rate, and they are 
loans whose average date of formalization is March 2004 and whose maximum maturity 
date for the fixed interest period is December 2007.  The present average rate on this 
portfolio is 4.47%. 
The principal reference of the variable interest rate Mortgage Loans is the aggregate 
IRPC for Savings Banks (savings bank mortgage benchmark) (72% of the portfolio) and 
the aggregate IRPH for Financial Institutions (2% of the portfolio).  The remainder of 
the Mortgage Loans are referenced to EURIBOR or MIBOR at twelve (12) months (25% 
of the portfolio), and 1% of the portfolio, to EURIBOR or MIBOR at six or three 
months, and to Public Debt. 
The aggregate equivalent margin on the Fund’s Mortgage Loans is 1.47%, and the 
present average interest rate is 3.98%.

As enhancements to the risk of the Mortgage Loans, 21% of the portfolio has more than 
one first mortgage guarantee, that is a first mortgage has been established on another 
property, 18% of the debtors submitted guarantors to the transaction, and 90% of 
borrowers keep their paychecks automatically deposited at the Bank. 
Seven percent of the Mortgage Loans have the “Cuota Comodín” (missed payment) 
feature.  This is an option to which the borrower is entitled once per year during the first 
three years in the life of the loan, to substitute the obligation to pay one (1) of his 
monthly payments for capitalization together with the remainder of outstanding 
principal.  The substitution of payment of a monthly payment may not be exercised in 
two consecutive payments, even if pertaining to different years, and is not permitted to 
customers in a situation of non-payment.  The principal portion of the payment not made 
by the customer is added to the outstanding principal and the impact of this capitalization 
is regularized at the time of calculating the new monthly payment in function of the 
interest rate adjustment established in the loan deed.  Due to the age of the formalization 
dates of the Mortgage Loans subject to this option, 2% of the Mortgage Loans have 
exhausted the possibility of exercising this option, 1% have one (1) year remaining, and 
4% of borrowers who have this option may use it during the next two (2) years.  
Presently, less than 1% of the Loan portfolio have used the missed payment feature in 
the last year.

The Mortgage Loans also present the option, in favor and at the initiative of the 
customer, to limit the annual growth of payments in light of possible increases in their 
interest rates, to a maximum amount equal to 200%, 100% or 50% of the CPI (Consumer 
Price Index) for the last twelve (12) months, as published in the Bulletin of the National 
Statistics Institute, one (1) Month prior to proceeding with the adjustment) in function of 
the interest rate adjustment periods (12 months, 6 months, or 3 months, respectively).  
This option is a right of the borrower which he may exercise at the time of the interest 
rate adjustment.  If due to the limitation agreed, the entire debt would not be paid at the 
end of the original maturity of the Mortgage Loan, the borrower shall continue making 
monthly payments until the full payment of the debt, without this extension being able to 
exceed the maximum period of seven (7) years from the said original maturity date.  Of 
UCI’s total Mortgage Loan customer portfolio, 35.8% do not have the possibility of 
exercising this option, and of the remainder, 0.2% have this option during the entire life 
of the Mortgage Loan and due to the age of the formalization dates, 1% only have one 
(1) year remaining, and 63% of borrowers hold this option during the next two (2) years.  
The maximum maturity date of the portfolio which has this option to limit the growth of 
the mortgage payment throughout the entire life of the loan is September 5, 2027, 
whereby, adding the seven (7) years of extension, the Fund’s Legal Maturity Date (June 
15, 2042) is not exceeded.  A year is taken to mean the twelve (12) months included 
between each mortgage payment adjustment.

Nineteen percent of the Mortgage loans have the first thirty-six (36) payments 
predetermined and progressive (“Cuota Fácil” – Easy Payment) (the first year’s 
payment will have at least the amount of the payment with no principal, the remaining 
payments are progressive until reaching the amount of the normal financial payment 
the fourth year).  Interest accrued and not paid will be added to principal pending 
amortization.  As from the fourth year, the calculation of the new payment would 
absorb the impact of the possible principal grace period of the first three years.  
Twenty-six percent of the Mortgage Loans are “Cambio de Casa” (Change House) 
mortgage loans granted for the purchase of one residence when the borrower has not 
yet sold his previous property.  In this case both residences are mortgaged and the 
borrower is granted a period of two years to sell the previous property, with the 
obligation to repay the loan amount in function of the mortgage liability indicated for 
this residence.  At the present time, 82% of this portfolio has not yet sold its previous 
property.  Twelve percent of the Mortgage loans are subject to a fixed interest rate 
during the first three years (“Tipo Fijo 3 años” – 3-year Fixed).  These Mortgage Loans 
have an average formalization date of March 2004 and have a maximum maturity date 
of the fixed rate period of December 2007.  Of this loan portfolio, 70% is subject to a 
fixed payment the first three years and the remainder (30%) has a fixed payment the 
first six years, although the interest rate becomes variable in both cases as from the 
third year.  As from that time, all loans come to have their adjustable payment 
referenced to the 12-month Euribor interest rate, as published by the Bank of Spain 
(36%) or the IRPH Aggregate Institutions, or IRPC aggregate Savings Bank rates, as 
published by the Bank of Spain (64%).  The present average fixed rate on these loans is 
4.47%.  
Two percent of the portfolio are loans originated by UCI through its Internet portal or 
the Superlínea telephone service.  They are loans with an average spread of 0.45% over 
Euribor and an average LTV of 59%.  The remainder of the portfolio of Mortgage 
Loans (41%) is composed of variable interest loans, adjustable annually, half-yearly, or

feature and the option to limit the mortgage payment in function of CPI, as described

V.1.1 Hypotheses assumed in relation to the central or most probable indices of 
prepayment parameters, late payments, non-payments or charge-offs, with 
respect to the Mortgage Participations pooled into the Fund. 
The tables which appear below refer to one of the possible scenarios which, with 
respect to income and payments made by the Fund, could materialize throughout 
the life of the Fund and of this Bond issue. 
The following hypotheses have been used in order to prepare this financial 
servicing table for the Fund: 
a) Mortgage Loans. 
(i) Volume of portfolio of Mortgage Participations: EUR 1,049,012,750.75 
as at April 22, 2005.  As at the Pay-out Date, the amount to be securitized 
shall be EUR 900,000,000, approximately, as appears on the above 
Balance Sheet. 
(ii) Interest rate:  the average interest rate of the Mortgage Loans is 
EURIBOR + 1.47% and consequently, the rate of 3.98% per annum 
(0.33% per month) has been used to calculate the Fund’s income flows. 
(iii) CAPR: 15% per annum; 1.25% per month. 
(iv) Default percentage: 0.60% per annum, 0.05% per month. 
(v) Charge-offs: 0%. 
b) Bonds. 
(i) Volume: EUR 900,000,000 of which approximately 30% will be 
assigned to the Domestic Tranche and 70% to the International Tranche. 
(ii) Interest rate: weighted variable interest rate assuming that Classes A, B 
and C Bonds interest rates remain constant at 2.264%, 2.384% and 
2.634% respectively. 


UCI 12 
Prospectus 
May 2005 
CHAPTER V: INFORMATION ON ECONOMIC-FINANCIAL OPERATIONS OF THE MORTGAGE SECURITIZATION FUND 
 
 
81
(iii) Exercise by the issuer of the clean-up call on the three Classes Bonds 
when the Outstanding Balance of the Mortgage Participations is less than 
10% of the initial amount thereof. 
c) Supplementary Contracts. 
(i) Cash Account: it is assumed that the rating of the Bank’s short-term debt 
will at no time fall from A-1 as per the scale of S&P España, and that, 
therefore, the Cash Account will remain at the Bank (although a 
commitment by the Bank vis-à-vis the Manager exists to transfer this 
Account to another bank, in the event of a decline in the rating indicated 
above, as described under Section V.3.1 of this Prospectus), and will be 
subject to reinvestment by virtue of the Guaranteed Rate Reinvestment 
Agreement, to be entered into with the Bank. 
(ii) Subordinated Loan 
• Volume: EUR 11,225,000 to be earmarked towards financing the 
incorporation of the Fund and the Bond issue (approximately EUR 
674,458.40), to partially finance the subscription of the Mortgage 
Participations (approximately EUR 541.60), to cover the temporary 
shortfall in the First Interest Accrual Period for an amount equal to the 
difference to be generated between the interest on the Mortgage 
Participations to be collected from the Pay-out Date (June 2, 2005) 
through the maturity date of the first four payments (June through 
September) on the Mortgage Participations (September 5, 2005) and 
the interest on the Bonds to be paid on the first Payment Date 
(September 15, 2005) (EUR 200,000) and to fund the Reserve Fund 
(EUR 10,350,000). 
• Interest rate: interest rate of 2.684% 
• Repayment: the portion of the Subordinated Loan earmarked towards 
financing the expenses relating to incorporation of the Fund and the 
Bond issue and covering the temporary shortfall in the First Interest 
Accrual Period Mortgage Participations, will be amortized quarterly, 
to the extent that such expenses are depreciated during the first three 
(3) years from incorporation of the Fund and the Bond issue.  The 
portion of the Subordinated Loan earmarked towards partially 
financing the subscription of the Mortgage Participations will be 
amortized on the Payment Date subsequent to the Final Maturity Date 
of the said Mortgage Participations (December 15, 2039) or, as the 
case may be, on the date of prepayment thereof.  The remainder of 
principal on the Subordinated Loan shall be amortized on each one of 
the Payment Date in an amount equal to the difference existing 
between the amounts of the balances required of the Reserve Fund as 
at the previous Determination Date and the Determination Date in 
progress. 
 
(iii) Guaranteed Rate Reinvestment Agreement 
Guaranteed yield: 2.133% for amounts deposited into the Cash Account 
(including the Reserve Fund).  It is assumed that the EURIBOR interest 


UCI 12 
Prospectus 
May 2005 
CHAPTER V: INFORMATION ON ECONOMIC-FINANCIAL OPERATIONS OF THE MORTGAGE SECURITIZATION FUND 
 
 
82
rate applicable on each Payment Date will be maintained at 2.133% 
during the entire life of the issue. 
(iv) Reserve Fund 
The Reserve Fund shall be funded with an initial amount of EUR 
10,350,000 equivalent to 1.15% of the initial amount of the Bonds (EUR 
900,000,000), and shall remain fixed at this amount during the first three 
years.  The levels required from the amount of the Reserve Fund shall be 
established based on the late payment rates of the Mortgage 
Participations, as follows. 
Where the Reserve Fund reaches 2.3% of the Outstanding Balance of the 
Mortgage Participations, it may be decreased quarterly on each Payment 
Date, holding at such percentage until the Reserve Fund reaches a 
minimum level equal to 0.40% of the initial amount of the Bonds.  
This is the general rule, provided that the Outstanding Balance of the 
Mortgage Participations with late payments greater than or equal to 
ninety (90) days is less than 0.75%. Should there be any variations in the 
late payment rate of the Mortgage Participations, the Reserve Fund shall 
be subject to the terms below: 
• 
When, on a Payment Date, the Outstanding Balance of the 
Mortgage Participations subject to late payments greater than or 
equal to ninety (90) days i between 0.75% and 1.25% of the 
Outstanding Balance of the Mortgage Participations, and the 
Reserve Fund reaches 2.3% of the Outstanding Balance of the 
Mortgage Participations, the Reserve Fund may decrease down to a 
minimum 0.70% of the initial amount of the Bonds. The required 
level for the Reserve Fund shall remain constant, provided that 
such late payment rates are maintained. 
• 
Where, on a Payment Date, the Outstanding Balance of the 
Mortgage Participations subject to late payments greater than or 
equal to ninety (90) days is greater than 1.25% of the Outstanding 
Balance of the Mortgage Participations, the amount of the Reserve 
Fund shall be equal to the maximum amount between 0.80% of the 
Bond Initial Balance and 2.3% of the Outstanding Balance of the 
Mortgage Participations.  The required level for the Reserve Fund 
shall remain constant at the level it had reached on the said 
Payment Date until the Final Maturity Date of the Fund, in which it 
will be used for the performance of the Fund’s payment 
obligations. 
At the time when such circumstance does not occur, it may be 
decreased until reaching the required level. 
d) 
Fees 
(i) UCI fixed fee:  EUR 6,000 per quarter, VAT included, on each Payment 
Date. 


UCI 12 
Prospectus 
May 2005 
CHAPTER V: INFORMATION ON ECONOMIC-FINANCIAL OPERATIONS OF THE MORTGAGE SECURITIZATION FUND 
 
 
83
(ii) UCI variable Fee: a variable amount to accrue quarterly, on each 
Payment Date, equal to the difference between the income and expenses 
of the Fund for the said Determination Period. 
e) 
Current Expenses, including: 
(i) Manager Fee: 0.0225% per annum of the aggregate Balances Pending 
Payment on the Classes A, B and C Bonds.  
(ii) Expenses for annual audits of the Fund, publication of legal notices and 
maintenance of the credit rating of the Bonds. 
V.1.2 Analysis and comment on the impact the possible variations in the 
hypotheses described in the above section would have on the financial 
equilibrium of the Fund. 
The quality of the Mortgage Participations and the mechanisms for guaranteeing 
the reiterated financial equilibrium of the Fund are such that it is not reasonable 
to consider such extreme prepayment percentages, default rates and charge-offs 
which, as a consequence of the required transfer of both the risk of prepayment 
as well as of non-payment occurring in the underlying Loans, could cause the 
financial structure of the Fund to become imbalanced. 
V.1.3 Numeric outline of flows of income and expenses of the Fund. 
 
IMPORTANT NOTE FOR THE INVESTOR 
The information contained in the table below is for illustrative purposes only, 
and the amounts therein do not represent a particular payment obligation by the 
Fund to third parties, on or during the corresponding dates or periods referred 
thereto. The data included therein has been prepared under circumstances 
subject to continuous change. 
 
The numeric outline transcribed below refers to collections and payments 
deriving from the application of the cash principle, for greater clarity of the 
investor, although, and in accordance with the provisions of Section V.2 of this 
Prospectus, the Fund will impute income and expenses as per time, in following 
an accrual method. 
The said outline is based not only on the hypotheses mentioned under Section 
V.1.1, supra, but also on the constant maintenance during the life of the Fund of 
the said hypotheses and, as is well known, the affected variables, in particular the 
interest rates on the three Classes Bonds, as well as the actual prepayment rates 
of the Mortgage Loans underlying the Mortgage Participations, are subject to 
continuous changes.

contracts: 
V.3.1 Guaranteed Rate Reinvestment Agreement and Cash Account. 
The Bank and the Manager, on behalf of the Fund, shall enter into a Guaranteed 
Rate Reinvestment Agreement whereby the Bank shall guarantee a yield on the 
sums deposited by the Fund, through its Manger, into the financial account 
initially opened by the Manager in the Fund’s name, at the Bank.  Specifically, 
the Guaranteed Rate Reinvestment Agreement shall determine that the amounts 
the Fund receives for: 
(i) 
principal and interest on the Mortgage Participations; 
(ii) 
any other amounts, assets or rights, which are received in payment of 
principal or ordinary and default interest on the Mortgage Loans, or for 
disposal or exploitation of the properties awarded in foreclosure of the 
mortgage collateral, or as a consequence of the said foreclosures, in 
administration and interim possession of the properties in the process of 
being foreclosed, as well as all possible rights or indemnities which may 
result in favor of UCI, including not only those arising out of the 
insurance contracts assigned by UCI to the Fund, but also those arising 
out of any right accessory to the Mortgage Loans, and excluding all fees 
contemplated in the Mortgage Loans which shall be for the benefit of 
UCI. 
(iii) 
amount of principal of the foreclosed Mortgage Loans, from the date of 
disposal of the property, acquisition at the awarded price or amount 
determined by judicial resolution or notarial proceeding; 
(iv) 
the amount which is contained in the Reserve Fund (as described in

amounts deposited into the Cash Account, equal to the EURIBOR at three (3) 
months or four (4) months for the First Interest Accrual Period (as defined in

The calculation of the yield obtained on the investments made daily shall be 
performed by taking the actual days and, as a base, a year composed of three 
hundred sixty-five (365) days.  Settlement of interest shall be monthly, five (5) 
business days prior to the 15th of each month. 
In no event shall the Bank be entitled to dispose of any amount deposited under 
this Agreement, as an off-setting of any debts the Fund may have to the Bank.  
In the event that the Bank’s short-term debt should undergo, during the life of the 
issue, a decline in its rating below A-1 (as per the rating scale of S&P Rating 
Services), the Manager, on behalf of the Fund, shall transfer the Fund’s Cash 
Account to a bank whose short-term debt possesses a minimum rating of A-1, 
and shall contract the maximum yield possible for its balance, which may be 
different from the one contracted with the Bank, within a maximum period of 
thirty (30) Business Days from the time in which such situation takes place, and 
the Bank shall, subsequently, cease carrying out the investment upon the funds 
available in the Cash Account being transferred to the new bank, and may later 
trasfer it to the Bank when its short-term debt once again achieves a rating of A-
1, as per the scale mentioned above. 
The counterparty of the Fund in the Reinvestment Agreement at a Guaranteed 
Interest Rate and Cash Account shall always remain with a minimum A-1 rating 
(as per the rating scale of S&P Rating Services). 
In the event that the sum accumulated in the Cash Account exceeds 20% of the 
Balance Pending Payment on the Bonds, the Manager, on behalf of the Fund, 
shall open a new account at a bank having a rating of A-1+ (the “Surplus Funds 
Account”) into which all such amounts which exceed the above-mentioned 20% 
shall be deposited.  In the event that the new bank should lose the A-1+ rating, 
the Manager shall have 30 days to find a new bank with the adequate rating.  The 
Manager shall notify S&P España as far in advance as possible of the probability 
of this event occurring 
In the event that the Manager, at contracting the maximum yield for the balance 
of the Surplus Funds Account, opted for investing in securities, such securities 
would need to have a minimum rating of A-1+ (as per the rating scale of S&P 
Rating Services) with maturity prior to the following interest Payment Date. 
At the present time, the returns on the Mortgage Participations which constitute 
income for the Fund are not subject to withholding, as established in article 
59.K), Chapter II, Title IV, of the Corporate Income Tax Regulations, approved 
by Royal Decree 1777/2004.  
The Guaranteed Rate Reinvestment Agreement seeks to contribute towards 
mitigating the risk of a time-based shortfall between the Fund’s income for 
principal and interest on the Mortgage Participations, on a daily basis, and the 
redemption and interest payments on the Bonds, on a quarterly basis. 
V.3.2 Subordinated Loan Agreement in the amount of Euros eleven million two 
hundred and twenty five thousand (EUR 11,225,000). 
The Manager, on behalf of the Fund and Union de Crédit pour le Batiment S.A. 
(“UCB”) (a company 99.93% owned by BNP Paribas) shall enter into with the 
Bank a Subordinated Loan Agreement (on a 50%/50% basis as per their creditor

thousand (EUR 11,225,000), which shall be earmarked towards financing the 
incorporation expenses of the Fund and the Bond issue, and towards partially 
financing the acquisition of the Mortgage Participations, to cover the temporary 
shortfall in the First Interest Accrual Period for an amount equal to the difference 
to be generated between the interest on the Mortgage Participations to be 
collected from the Pay-out Date (June 2, 2005) through the maturity date of the 
first four payments (June through September) of the Mortgage Participations 
(September 5, 2005) and the interest on the Bonds to be paid on the first Payment 
Date (September 15, 2005) and to fund a Reserve Fund to be applied on each 
Payment Date, together with the remainder of Available Funds, as described in 
Section V.5.1,b), 1, of the Prospectus, to the performance of all payment 
obligations or withholding of the Fund, in the order of priority contemplated in 
Section V.5.1, b), 2 of the Prospectus.  The said Reserve Fund is described in 
Section V.3.3 of this Prospectus. 
The Subordinated Loan shall accrue nominal interest per annum which results 
from adding 0.55% to the EURIBOR at three (3) months or at four (4) months 
for the First Interest Accrual Period (as defined in Chapter II of this Prospectus) 
during the quarter immediately preceding each Payment Date, and which shall be 
paid only if the Fund has sufficient liquidity in accordance with the order of 
priority of payments established under Section V.5.1,b),2 of this Prospectus.  
Interest accrued which must be paid on a given Payment Date shall be calculated 
by taking the following as a base:  (i) the actual days existing in each Interest 
Accrual Period described under Section II.10.1,a) of the Prospectus, and (ii) three 
hundred sixty (360) days. 
Interest accrued and not paid on a Payment Date, shall be accumulated, accruing 
default interest at the same rate as that of the Subordinated Loan and shall be 
paid, provided that the Fund has sufficient liquidity, and in accordance with the 
order of priority of payments contemplated under Section V.5.1,b), 2 of the 
Prospectus. 
The portion of the Subordinated Loan assigned to financing the expenses relating 
to incorporation of the Fund (as described in Section II.14, a) of this Prospectus), 
and that assigned to financing the expenses relating to the Bond issue (as per 
Section II.14, b)), as well as the part assigned to covering the temporary 
imbalance during the First Period of the Interest Accrual shall be amortized 
quarterly to the extent such expenses are depreciated during the first three (3) 
years from the incorporation of the Fund and the Bond issue.  Notwithstanding 
the above, the said portion of the Subordinated Loan may be prepaid, provided 
that the Fund has sufficient liquidity, in accordance with the order of priority of 
payments contemplated in Section V.5.1, b), 2), and it is so agreed between the 
Manager and UCI. 
The portion of the Subordinated Loan earmarked towards partially financing the 
subscription of the Mortgage Participations shall be amortized on the Payment 
Date subsequent to the Final Maturity Date of the said Mortgage Participations 
(December 15, 2039) or, as the case may be, on the date of prepayment thereof.  
The remaining principal on the Subordinated Loan shall be amortized on each 
one of the Payment Dates in an amount equal to the difference existing between 
the amounts of the balances required of the Reserve Fund (as described in 
Section V.3.3 of the Prospectus) on the previous Determination Date and

fifty thousand (EUR 10,350,000), equivalent to 1.15% of the initial amount of 
the Bonds and shall remain fixed at the said amount during the first three 
years.  Once it reaches 2.3% of the Outstanding Balance of the Mortgage 
Participations, the Reserve Fund may decrease quarterly on each Payment 
Date.  As from this time, the Reserve Fund shall reach the greater of the 
following amounts and shall remain constant, depending on the late payment 
rate of the Mortgage Participations, in the following amounts: 
• 
A minimum amount of 0.40% of the initial amount of the Bonds 
when, on a Payment Date, the Outstanding Balance of the Mortgage 
Participations subject to late payments greater than or equal to ninety 
(90) days is less than 0.75% of the Outstanding Balance of the 
Mortgage Participations, after which time it shall remain constant at 
the said level as long as such situation persists; or  
• 
A minimum amount of 0.70% of the initial amount of the Bonds 
when, on a Payment Date, the Outstanding Balance of the Mortgage 
Participations subject to late payments greater than or equal to ninety 
(90) days is between 0.75% and 1.25% of the Outstanding Balance of 
the Mortgage Participations, and the Reserve Fund reaches 2.3% of 
the Outstanding Balance of the Mortgage Participations, the Reserve 
Fund shall reach a minimum amount of 0.70% of the initial amount of 
the Bonds. The required level for the Reserve Fund shall remain 
constant, provided that such late payment rates are maintained; or 
• 
An amount equivalent, on a Payment Date, to the maximum between 
0.80% of the Initial Balance of the Bonds and 2.3% of the 
Outstanding Balance of the Mortgage Participations, where the 
Outstanding Balance of the Mortgage Participations subject to late 
payments greater than or equal to ninety (90) days is greater than 
1.25% of the Outstanding Balance of the Mortgage Participations. The 
Reserve Fund shall remain constant at the level it would have reached 
on the said Payment Date, through the Final Maturity Date of the 
Fund, on which it shall be used for performance of the Fund’s 
payment obligations. 
At the time in which such circumstance does not occur, it may decrease until 
reaching the required level.

CHAPTER VII 
RECENT PROGRESS AND PROSPECTS OF THE MORTGAGE SECURITIZATION FUND 
 
 
VII.1 More recent and significant trends of the Market, generally. 
In April, the Euribor, which is the reference index used for most of the Mortgage 
Loans granted in Spain, continuously and gradually decreased, it being 2.335%, at 
the beginning of the month, and 2.205%, at the end of the month. Despite of such 
decrease, April’s index was higher than the 2.163% index of April last year, where 
it reached its lowest rate ever. 
The gradual reduction of the Euribor proves that European economy has not 
completed its growth, as estimated at the beginning of the year. Consequently, in 
order to enable the recovery of the economy and the consumer’s purchasing 
power, in absence of inflation tensions in the Euro zone, the Central European 
Bank has maintained the official interest rate at 2%. 
Most likely, the Euribor will maintain the above-mentioned rates, with slight 
variations, either upwards or downwards, at least, until the second half of this 
year, where further variation of European official rates is expected. 
Additionally, the family support’s option to external funding is increasingly 
growing, particularly affecting the mortgage loan sector, with its peak in 
September 2004, reaching 23.8%. According to the Bank of Spain, in February 
2005, not only the high level of progress of the last few months was kept, 
increasing by 24%, but it also speed up 0,4 points compared with the January 
increase. At the end of February 2005, the banks had granted mortgage loans to 
families for approximately Euros 7,000 million more than in January and Euros 
75,000 million more than in February 2004. 
The debt increase with regard to purchase of homes derives from the gradual 
increase of the price of housing, giving rise to the families being forced to request 
loans for higher amounts in order to afford the payment of the increasing price of 
housing. 
In the light of the aforementioned increase of loans granted by banks, the Bank of 
Spain is maintaining the risk control policy that allows anticipating to the 
problems of excessive late payment, considering the current level of allowance for 
doubtful accounts as appropriate and maintaining the “statistics fund”, so that the 
allowance level almost trebles the amount of doubtful payment loans. 
Nevertheless, the Bank of Spain remains cautious, specially at comparing the 
Spanish debt increase to the 5% increase in the rest of Europe.

VII.2 Implications that may derive from the trends under VII.1 above 
The Mortgage Loans portfolio underlying the Mortgage Participations, which 
owner shall be the Fondo de Titulización Hipotecaria UCI 12, is almost entirely 
comprised of Mortgage Loans under a variable interest rate. This means that a 
further decrease of the interest rates shall not affect loans under a variable rate 
since such rates shall be periodically adjusting to the market interest rate 
variations. Otherwise, should there be a substantial rate increase, the loans shall 
be affected by a high early payment rate.
