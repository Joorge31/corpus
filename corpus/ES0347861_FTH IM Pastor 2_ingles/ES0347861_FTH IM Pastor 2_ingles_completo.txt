This document is an English version of the Spanish Prospectus. No document other than the 
Spanish Prospectus, which has been registered in the Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores, may
be considered as having any legal effect whatsoever. 


 
 
 
These tables have been calculated in accordance with the assumptions included in sections II.12. of 
the Prospectus. 
“Pass-through” is a term generally accepted by the market place to indicate that the amortization of 
the Bonds takes place parallel to the amortization of the assets endorsing the Securities. The exact 
terms of the amortization conditions must be consulted in section II.11. of the Prospectus. Clean up 
Call is a term generally accepted by the market place to indicate the date of the early liquidation of 
the Fondo. 
3.1. Amount, Price and Interest Rate of the Bonds 
The Issue will be 1,000,000,000 Euros divided in 10,000 Bonds, grouped in four Series, represented as 
book entries of 100,000 nominal Euros each. The price of issue of each Bond shall be 100,000 Euros,  
100% of its nominal value. 
A Series shall be made up of 9,620 A Bonds, accruing a variable annual nominal interest, to be paid 
each quarter on each Payment Date equal to (i) 3-month EURIBOR interest rate, determined as 
established in section II.10.1. of the Prospectus, plus (ii) a margin determined as is established in 
section II.10.1. of the Propectus. 
B Series shall be integrated by 173 B Bonds, accruing a variable annual nominal interest, to be paid 
each quarter on each Payment Date equal to (i) 3-month EURIBOR interest rate, determined as is 
established in section II.10.1. of the Prospectus, plus (ii) a margin determined as is established in 
section II.10.1. of the Prospectus. 
C Series shall be integrated by 142 C Bonds, accruing a variable annual nominal interest, to be paid 
each quarter on each Payment Date equal to (i) 3-month EURIBOR interest rate, determined as is 
established in section II.10.1. of the Prospectus, plus (ii) a margin determined as is established in 
section II.10.1. of the Prospectus. 
D Series shall be integrated by 65 D Bonds, accruing a variable annual nominal interest, to be paid 
each quarter on each Payment Date equal to (i) 3-month EURIBOR interest rate, determined as is 
established in section II.10.1. of the Prospectus, plus (ii) a margin determined as is established in 
section II.10.1. of the Prospectus. 
In all cases, interests on the bonds will be calculated actual/360.  
Penalty Interest: Both for interest and principal, unpaid amounts will not accrue penalty interest. 
3.2. Amortisation of the Bonds. 
The redemption amount  of each Bond shall be 100,000 Euros, equivalent to its nominal value. 
The Bonds will be amortised pro rata among the Bonds of the corresponding Series, through the 
reduction of the nominal amount until its total redemption. The amortization of the B Bonds will 
commence once the A Series Bonds are fully amortized. The amortization of the C Bonds will 
commence once the B Series Bonds are fully amortized. The amortization of the D Bonds will 
commence once the C Series Bonds are fully amortized. On each Payment Date,  in accordance with 
the Priority Order of Payments and the above subordination rule, Bonds will amortize the lesser of the 
following amounts (Available Amount for Amortization): 
a) The positive difference, on said Payment Date, between the Outstanding Nominal Balance of 
the Bonds (before the amortization taking place on such date) and the Outstanding Nominal 
Balance of the non-defaulted Mortgage Shares corresponding to the last day of the month prior 


 
 
to the Payment Date, estimated in accordance with the scheduled amortization of the Mortgage 
Loans minus the   prepayments of the calendar month prior to the Payment Date; and 
b) The Available Resources on said Payment Date, minus the amounts from the concepts 
described in sections (i) through (vii) of section V.4.2. of the Prospectus. 
The amortization of the A Bonds will be subject to the amortization pace of the Mortgage Loans and 
will begin on the first Payment Date, including this date. The amortization of the Mortgage Loans will 
be transferred to the A Bonds each quarter, in the terms established in section II.11.3. of the Prospectus. 
In accordance with the above mentioned subordinations, the amortization of B, C and D Bonds will be 
subject to the amortization pace of the Mortgage loans and their amortization will be transferred to the 
Bonds each quarter, in the terms established in section II.11.4., II.11.5. and II.11.6. of the Prospectus. 
In the event that there are no Available Resources to make these payments, the amounts will remain 
outstanding until the following Payment Date. 
3.3. Maturity of the Bonds. 
The Bonds will mature on the Date in which they are fully amortised or on the date of the liquidation of 
the Fondo. 
The last regular amortization date for the loans grouped in the portfolio to be securitised will be 
December 31, 2038. 
 
4. Mortgage Shares comprising the Assets of the Fondo. 
 
The assets of IM PASTOR 2 are comprised of the Mortgage Shares issued by Banco Pastor from first 
rank-mortgage loans granted to purchase, build or restore a residential property located in Spain over a 
property appraised by an Appraisal Agency registered in the Special Register of the Bank of Spain. The 
loan to value ratio of those loans does not exceed 80%. The properties are insured against damages and 
fire. The Prospectus includes a copy of the audit report assessing the level of compliance of said 
characteristics of the sold portfolio. 
Each Mortgage Share refers to 100% of the outstanding principal of each Mortgage Loan, and accrues 
an interest rate equal to the type of nominal interest rate accrued at any given time by the Mortgage 
Loan. 
The Mortgage Loans all carry a variable interest rate, which resets every year. Some loans have a fixed 
interest rate. During an initial period a substantial number of Mortgage Loans have variable spreads, 
which will vary as a function of the number of financial products of the borrower with Banco Pastor.  
Full regarding this point. 
As holder of the Mortgage Share, the Fondo holds all legal rights recognized by the applicable  
legislation and the Mortgage Share Certificate. Besides payments made by the debtors of the Mortgage 
Loans, the Fondo will receive any other payment due to the Issuer, as mortgage servicer, from the 
Mortgage Loans, including those arising from any accessories to the Loan, such as compensation from 
insurance policies, payments made by possible guarantors, etc., with the exception of delinquent 
interest, unpaid receipt claims, subrogation commissions, substitution and prepayment commissions, 
together with any other commission which may correspond to the Issuer of the Mortgage Share 
Certificates. 
The Mortgage Loans have been granted by Banco Pastor following standard procedures and are 
serviced in accordance to its general management criteria.

In recent years the Spanish Mortgage Mark has ben afctod by a grow process in respecto

homogenciy of mortgage lous, not only tom the legal point of view, but also from the
conomio pespecive which implcs the use of defined refrence rates for variable rate loans,
recommended by the monctay authors. In hs sens, the subsiualon 0? purly monctary
rate were casly substituto by hor vih a more siaistica nature like 1-ycar MIBOR. (is
úalclation method modiid by Ministerial Order December 1 1999) o, since Jul 199, th 1
your Itcbunking Reference (Bank of Spain Circular 799 July 29), clriving possible
“listonions derived from a institutional market, Additmally, cor reference rats obtainod
¿dircly from the Markt have becn recommended and introducod, more representative of price
«volutions. Finally, reference was introduced wi a significance and reach closer o ong em,

Secondly, Ie cvolution of interest rats has produced a significant move of credit ets”
