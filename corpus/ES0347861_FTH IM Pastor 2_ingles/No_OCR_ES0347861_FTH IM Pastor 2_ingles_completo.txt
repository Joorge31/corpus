This document is an English version of the Spanish Prospectus. No document other than the 
Spanish Prospectus, which has been registered in the Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores, may
be considered as having any legal effect whatsoever. 


 
 
 
These tables have been calculated in accordance with the assumptions included in sections II.12. of 
the Prospectus. 
“Pass-through” is a term generally accepted by the market place to indicate that the amortization of 
the Bonds takes place parallel to the amortization of the assets endorsing the Securities. The exact 
terms of the amortization conditions must be consulted in section II.11. of the Prospectus. Clean up 
Call is a term generally accepted by the market place to indicate the date of the early liquidation of 
the Fondo. 
3.1. Amount, Price and Interest Rate of the Bonds 
The Issue will be 1,000,000,000 Euros divided in 10,000 Bonds, grouped in four Series, represented as 
book entries of 100,000 nominal Euros each. The price of issue of each Bond shall be 100,000 Euros,  
100% of its nominal value. 
A Series shall be made up of 9,620 A Bonds, accruing a variable annual nominal interest, to be paid 
each quarter on each Payment Date equal to (i) 3-month EURIBOR interest rate, determined as 
established in section II.10.1. of the Prospectus, plus (ii) a margin determined as is established in 
section II.10.1. of the Propectus. 
B Series shall be integrated by 173 B Bonds, accruing a variable annual nominal interest, to be paid 
each quarter on each Payment Date equal to (i) 3-month EURIBOR interest rate, determined as is 
established in section II.10.1. of the Prospectus, plus (ii) a margin determined as is established in 
section II.10.1. of the Prospectus. 
C Series shall be integrated by 142 C Bonds, accruing a variable annual nominal interest, to be paid 
each quarter on each Payment Date equal to (i) 3-month EURIBOR interest rate, determined as is 
established in section II.10.1. of the Prospectus, plus (ii) a margin determined as is established in 
section II.10.1. of the Prospectus. 
D Series shall be integrated by 65 D Bonds, accruing a variable annual nominal interest, to be paid 
each quarter on each Payment Date equal to (i) 3-month EURIBOR interest rate, determined as is 
established in section II.10.1. of the Prospectus, plus (ii) a margin determined as is established in 
section II.10.1. of the Prospectus. 
In all cases, interests on the bonds will be calculated actual/360.  
Penalty Interest: Both for interest and principal, unpaid amounts will not accrue penalty interest. 
3.2. Amortisation of the Bonds. 
The redemption amount  of each Bond shall be 100,000 Euros, equivalent to its nominal value. 
The Bonds will be amortised pro rata among the Bonds of the corresponding Series, through the 
reduction of the nominal amount until its total redemption. The amortization of the B Bonds will 
commence once the A Series Bonds are fully amortized. The amortization of the C Bonds will 
commence once the B Series Bonds are fully amortized. The amortization of the D Bonds will 
commence once the C Series Bonds are fully amortized. On each Payment Date,  in accordance with 
the Priority Order of Payments and the above subordination rule, Bonds will amortize the lesser of the 
following amounts (Available Amount for Amortization): 
a) The positive difference, on said Payment Date, between the Outstanding Nominal Balance of 
the Bonds (before the amortization taking place on such date) and the Outstanding Nominal 
Balance of the non-defaulted Mortgage Shares corresponding to the last day of the month prior 


 
 
to the Payment Date, estimated in accordance with the scheduled amortization of the Mortgage 
Loans minus the   prepayments of the calendar month prior to the Payment Date; and 
b) The Available Resources on said Payment Date, minus the amounts from the concepts 
described in sections (i) through (vii) of section V.4.2. of the Prospectus. 
The amortization of the A Bonds will be subject to the amortization pace of the Mortgage Loans and 
will begin on the first Payment Date, including this date. The amortization of the Mortgage Loans will 
be transferred to the A Bonds each quarter, in the terms established in section II.11.3. of the Prospectus. 
In accordance with the above mentioned subordinations, the amortization of B, C and D Bonds will be 
subject to the amortization pace of the Mortgage loans and their amortization will be transferred to the 
Bonds each quarter, in the terms established in section II.11.4., II.11.5. and II.11.6. of the Prospectus. 
In the event that there are no Available Resources to make these payments, the amounts will remain 
outstanding until the following Payment Date. 
3.3. Maturity of the Bonds. 
The Bonds will mature on the Date in which they are fully amortised or on the date of the liquidation of 
the Fondo. 
The last regular amortization date for the loans grouped in the portfolio to be securitised will be 
December 31, 2038. 
 
4. Mortgage Shares comprising the Assets of the Fondo. 
 
The assets of IM PASTOR 2 are comprised of the Mortgage Shares issued by Banco Pastor from first 
rank-mortgage loans granted to purchase, build or restore a residential property located in Spain over a 
property appraised by an Appraisal Agency registered in the Special Register of the Bank of Spain. The 
loan to value ratio of those loans does not exceed 80%. The properties are insured against damages and 
fire. The Prospectus includes a copy of the audit report assessing the level of compliance of said 
characteristics of the sold portfolio. 
Each Mortgage Share refers to 100% of the outstanding principal of each Mortgage Loan, and accrues 
an interest rate equal to the type of nominal interest rate accrued at any given time by the Mortgage 
Loan. 
The Mortgage Loans all carry a variable interest rate, which resets every year. Some loans have a fixed 
interest rate. During an initial period a substantial number of Mortgage Loans have variable spreads, 
which will vary as a function of the number of financial products of the borrower with Banco Pastor.  
Full regarding this point. 
As holder of the Mortgage Share, the Fondo holds all legal rights recognized by the applicable  
legislation and the Mortgage Share Certificate. Besides payments made by the debtors of the Mortgage 
Loans, the Fondo will receive any other payment due to the Issuer, as mortgage servicer, from the 
Mortgage Loans, including those arising from any accessories to the Loan, such as compensation from 
insurance policies, payments made by possible guarantors, etc., with the exception of delinquent 
interest, unpaid receipt claims, subrogation commissions, substitution and prepayment commissions, 
together with any other commission which may correspond to the Issuer of the Mortgage Share 
Certificates. 
The Mortgage Loans have been granted by Banco Pastor following standard procedures and are 
serviced in accordance to its general management criteria.

 Illustrative Character of the Information: The information in the tables contained in the 
Prospectus regarding interest rates, amortization of principal, average lives and yields, 
and especially the information contained in the Financial Service Table of the Fondo is 
provided only on an illustrative basis, and the stated amounts do not represent concrete 
payment obligations by the Fondo to third parties on the corresponding dates or periods to 
which they refer. The data have been calculated under assumptions of interest, default and 
prepayment rates that are subject to continuous change; therefore any investor interested

Risk of default of the Mortgage Share Certificates: In accordance with the provisions of 
article 5 (8) of Law 19/1992, Bondholders shall bear the risk of default of the Mortgage

Debtors of principal, interest or any other amount that may be due by virtue of the

in guaranteeing, either directly or indirectly, the paymens to the Bondholders, nor will 
they give guarantees or warranties, nor enter into repurchase agreements for the Mortgage 
Share Certificates, neither in virtue of the Fondo Regulations nor in that of any other

amount due to the Bondholders, the Bondholders will have recourse only against the 
Sociedad Gestora and only in the event that the Sociedad Gestora is in breach of one of its

representative of the Fondo vis-à-vis third parties and in any legal proceeding, in 
accordance with the law. 
The obligatios of the Issuers and the rest pof the participants in the operation are limited to 
those arising from the corresponding contracts relating to the Fondo IM PASTOR 2; the 
relevant obligations are descibed in this Prospectus. 
 
Nature of the Prospectus: a prerequisite for the establishment of the Fondo and the issue of

CHAPTER I 
PERSONS ASSUMING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONTENTS 
OF THE PROSPECTUS SUPERVISING ENTITIES 
I.1.  Persons assuming responsibility for the contents of the Prospectus 
I.1.1. 
Identification of the individuals that assume responsibility for the contents of the 
Prospectus, on behalf of the Sociedad Gestora. 
D. José Antonio Trujillo del Valle, President of INTERMONEY TITULIZACIÓN, SGFT, 
S.A., as a result of the agreement reached by the Board of Directors of the Sociedad Gestora 
on May 10, 2004, assumes responsibility for the contents of the Prospectus, in name and on 
behalf of the Sociedad Gestora. D. José Antonio Trujillo del Valle, hereto representative, 
confirms the accuracy of the contents of the Prospectus and that no relevant details induce 
error or have been omitted.  
INTERMONEY TITULIZACIÓN, SGFT, S.A. has its registered address in Madrid, at Plaza 
Pablo Ruiz Picasso 1, and its Fiscal Identity Code (CIF) is A-83774885. It is registered in the 
Registro de Sociedades Gestoras de Fondos de Titulización at the CNMV as number 10. 
I.2.  Supervising Entities 
I.2.1. 
Registration and Inscription of the Issue in the Official Registers of the CNMV. 
This Prospectus has been registered in the Official Registers of the CNMV on June 22, 2004. 
This registration only implies the acknowledgement that it includes all the information 
requested by the rules that establish its contents, and in no event does it determine the 
responsibility of the CNMV for the lack of accuracy of the information it contains. 
The recording of the Prospectus in the CNMV does not imply a recommendation to subscribe 
or purchase the securities; neither does it imply a declaration, in any form and manner, of the 
solvency of the issuing entities or the profitability of the issue. 
I.3.  Audit Reports 
The Board of Directors of the Sociedad Gestora, in its meeting of May 10, 2004, has designated 
Deloitte & Touch España, S.L., R.O.A.C. number S0692, as auditor of the Fondo. The Board of 
Directors of the Sociedad Gestora will inform the CNMV of any change which may occur in 
respect of the designation of the auditors. 
Annex 4 of this Prospectus includes the Audit Report on the Issue of Mortgage Share 
Certificates to be grouped in the Fondo IM PASTOR 2 carried out by Deloitte & Touch for 
Banco Pastor. The report, among others, refers to the verification of the compliance of the 


 CHAPTER I - Persons assuming responsibility for the contents of the Prospectus 
2 
conditions required by Law 2/1981, March 25, regarding the issue of Mortgage Share 
Certificates. 
The report uses sampling techniques, a method generally accepted to verify an entity’s registries 
in relation to a group of entries (population), and allow a conclusion of said population through 
the analysis of the number of entries (sample) bellow the total group. The level of confidence 
indicates the possibility that the real number of entries with deviations in respect of the existing 
trend in a real population does not exceed a predetermined limit (precision). The size of the 
sample and the level of confidence chosen, determine that the absence of errors in the sample 
corresponds to a maximum number of errors inferred for the population, other than zero. 
The detection of new errors, inferred but undetected by the auditors for the rest of the population 
excluded from the sample, will be treated with the substitution of the Mortgage Share 
Certificates affected, in accordance with section IV.1. 
The Sociedad Gestora declares that all the Mortgage Loans backing the Mortgage Share 
Certificates grouped in the Fondo IM PASTOR 2, described in section IV.4 of this Prospectus, 
belong to the portfolio audited in the report mentioned in this section.

CHAPTER II 
INFORMATION RELATING TO THE SECURITIES ISSUED 
II.1.  Information relating to requirements and prior obligatory agreements 
II.1.1. 
Agreement of the Board of Directors, granting of the Public Deed and any others 
required by current legislation. 
The issue and subscription of the Mortgage Share Certificates and the constitution of the 
Fondo have been authorized by the agreements adopted by the Board of Directors of Banco 
Pastor, S.A., held on February 26, 2004 and by the Board of Directors of the Sociedad 
Gestora, held on May 10, 2004 as included in Annexes 1 and 2 of this Prospectus. 
The Sociedad Gestora is qualified to arrange Mortgage-backed Securitization Fondos and, 
accordingly, to administer and legally represent them, pursuant to Law 19/1992. 
The deed containing the Fondo Regulations will be drawn up prior to the beginning of the 
Subscription Period for the Bonds. 
Pursuant to Law 19/1992 of July 7, neither the Fondo nor the securities issued by it will be 
registered in the Commercial Register. 
II.1.2. 
Listing and Clearance of the securities issued. 
This issue will be presented to the AIAF Market, an organized secondary securities market 
established by the Asociación de Intermediarios de Activos Financieros. 
The entity responsible for the accounting register of the Bonds shall be IBERCLEAR, which 
will balance and clear Bond transactions. These functions will be undertaken directly by 
IBERCLEAR through its participating entities. 
II.2.  Administrative Authorization Prior to the Issue. 
No administrative authorization prior to the issue of the Bonds is necessary other than the 
inscription of the Prospectus at the Official Registers of the CNMV. 
II.3.  Evaluation of the risk inherent to the Bonds 
The Sociedad Gestora, as founder and legal representative of the Fondo, and the Issuer of the 
Mortgage Share Certificates, have agreed to request ratings for each Series of Bonds from 
Moody's Investors Service España, S.A., (hereon, Moody’s) and Standard & Poor’s (hereon, 
S&P), in accordance with Article 5.8 of Law 19/1992. 
On the Date of registration of the Prospectus the following preliminary ratings for the Bonds are 
available:

The assesment of the Rating Agencies consists of the evaluation of the Bonds and their rating. 
The rating, by definition, is the opinion of the Agencies on the level of credit risk (arrears or 
default) associated with the Bonds. In the absence of confirmation of any of these preliminary 
ratings prior to the opening of the Subscription Period for the Bonds, the constitution of the 
Fondo and the issue of the Bonds will be cancelled. 
The ratings, including their revision or withdrawal: 
(i) 
Are formulated by the Rating Agencies on the basis of numerous information received, 
information they do not guarantee as accurate or complete, and therefore will not be held 
responsible in any way for said information; and 
(ii) 
Do not constitute and will not be understood as an invitation, recommendation or 
inducement to the investors to undertake any action in respect of the Bonds, and in 
particular their purchase, retention, pledge or sale. 
Moody’s ratings measure the expected loss before September 22, 2041. Its risk ratings constitute 
an opinion on the ability of the Bonds to attend periodical interest and principal payments during 
the life of the transaction, and in any case, before September 22, 2041. 
S&P’s risk ratings constitute an opinion on the ability of the Fondo to attend interest payments 
on time on each established payment date and to return principal during the life of the 
transaction, and in any case, before September 22, 2041. 
Ratings by Moody’s and S&P take into account the structure of the Bond issue, legal and Fondo 
aspects, Asset characteristics and the regularity of the transaction’s flows. 
Ratings may be revised, suspended or withdrawn by the Agencies at any given moment as a 
result of new information they may receive. These circumstances, which will not force the early 
amortization of the Fondo, will be notified immediately to the CNMV and the bondholders, in 
accordance with section III.5.4. 
To undertake the rating and monitoring, the Rating Agencies rely on the accuracy and 
completeness of the information provided by the Sociedad Gestora, the auditors, the legal 
advisors and other experts. 
The Sociedad Gestora, on behalf of the Fondo, undertakes to provide the Rating Agencies with 
periodical information regarding the Fondo and the Mortgage Share Certificates. It will equally 
provide this information when reasonably requested, and, in any event, when there is a change in 
the circumstances of the Fondo, the agreed contracts between the Fondo and the Sociedad 
Gestora or any interested parties. 
The Sociedad Gestora will carry out its best efforts in order to maintain the initial level of rating 
for the Bonds, and in the event that the rating is lowered, to re-establish it.

The Bonds are issued under Law 19/1992 and enjoy the legal nature of fixed rent securities 
which are homogenous in each Series, standardized and, therefore, susceptible of being traded in 
organized security markets. 
II.4.1. 
Different Periodicity between the Flow of Income and Payments of the Fondo. 
The financial service of the Bonds is effected from the flow of income of the Mortgage Share 
Certificates. The Fondo receives such income on a monthly basis and makes its payments on 
a quarterly basis, such income being temporarily invested in the Reinvestment Account, as 
specified in section V.3.5. of this Prospectus. Global protection mechanisms are available, 
which cover up to a certain limit the risk of insufficiency of resources of the Fondo and 
which have been taken into consideration by the Rating Agencies when rating the Bond issue 
risk described in section II.3. of this Prospectus. 
II.4.2. 
Priority of payments. 
Payment of interest and principal to Bondholders is subject to the Priority of Payments of the 
Fondo described in section V.4.2 of this Prospectus. 
II.4.3. 
Other risk considerations. 
II.4.3.1. 
Risk of default of the Mortgage Share Certificates. 
In accordance with Article 5.8 of Law 19/1992, holders of Bonds issued by the Fondo 
will bear the risk of default of the Mortgage Share Certificates and therefore, the risk 
of the Mortgage Loans. Certain compromises included in the Fondo Regulations act as 
protection and are described in section V.3 of this Prospectus. 
The Issuer will not be responsible for the default of the mortgage borrowers of either 
principal, interest or any other amount due from the Mortgage Loans. Neither will it 


 CHAPTER II – Information relating to the securities issued 
6 
assume, under any other form, responsibility for guaranteeing directly or indirectly the 
success of the transaction, nor will it grant guarantees or warranties nor enter into 
Mortgage Share Certificates repurchase agreements. All of the above without prejudice 
to the responsibilities of the Issuer in relation to that agreed in the Subordinated Loan 
Contract, the Participative Loan Contract and the compromise described in Clause 10 
of the Fondo regulations and in section IV.2. of this Prospectus. 
II.4.3.2. 
Risk of prepayment of the Mortgage Share Certificates. 
The Mortgage Share Certificates grouped in the Fondo may be prepaid when the 
borrowers of the underlying mortgage loans anticipate the reimbursement of the 
outstanding amount from said loan. Such risk will be transferred quarterly to the 
Bondholders on each Payment Date, in accordance with the rules of amortization 
described in section II.11. of this Prospectus. 
II.4.3.3. 
Other considerations 
Limited Protection: Investment may be affected, among others, by a downturn in the 
general economic conditions that may have a negative effect on the Mortgage Loan 
payments backing the issue of the Fondo. In the event defaults reach a certain level 
they could reduce, or even eliminate, the loss protection the Bonds enjoy as a result of 
the existence of the credit enhancements described in section V.3 of this Prospectus. 
Limited Responsibility: Bonds issued by the Fondo do not represent an obligation of 
the Sociedad Gestora or the Issuer. The cash-flow used to attend the obligations 
derived from the bonds is ensured or guaranteed only by the specific circumstances of 
this Prospectus and to the limits mentioned. With the exception of these guarantees, 
there are no others granted by public or private entities, including the Issuer, the 
Sociedad Gestora and any other entity affiliated or participated by any of the above. 
The Mortgage Share Certificates representing the Loans and the rights they imply are 
the only source of income of the Fondo and, therefore, of payments to the holders of its 
liabilities. 
Limited Liquidity: There is no guarantee that market trading with a minimum 
frequency or volume for the Bonds will develop. 
Furthermore, in no event will the Fondo repurchase the Bonds from the Bondholders 
although they may be fully prepaid in the event of the early liquidation of the Fondo 
when their Outstanding Nominal Balance of the outstanding Mortgage Share 
Certificates is below 10% of the initial balance, in the terms described in section III.10. 
of this Prospectus. 
Yield: the prepayment amortization rate of the loans may be influenced by a variety of 
geographical, economic and social factors such as the age of the debtors, seasonality, 
market interest rates and unemployment. 
The calculation of the yield, average life and duration of the Bonds is subject to 
prepayment amortization rates that may not take place. 
Penalty Interest: In the event of non-payment to the Bondholders, the outstanding 
amounts, both for coupon and principal, will not accrue penalty interest. 


 CHAPTER II – Information relating to the securities issued 
7 
Legal Aspects: On the Date of Incorporation of the Fondo Several representation, the 
Issuer will grant a series of declarations and guarantees on the characteristics of the 
Loans and the Mortgage Share Certificates in respect of the existence of the Loans and 
the guarantees, if they exist, related to them, and the absence of limits for the issue of 
the Mortgage Share Certificates and their compliance with the characteristics of the 
Mortgage Loans defined in the Fondo Regulations. In any event, the Issuer does not 
guarantee the solvency of any Loan debtor. Furthermore, these guarantees do not allow 
the Bondholders to exercise any right against the Issuer they may have against the 
Fondo. The Sociedad Gestora is the only entity authorized to represent the 
Bondholders in their relation with third parties or in any legal procedure related to the 
Fondo IM PASTOR 2. 
In accordance with the Fondo Regulations, the Issuer, as manager of the Mortgage 
Loans, undertakes to carry out the administration of the Mortgage Loans with the same 
criteria than the one applied to other loans of its portfolio. 
II.5.  Representation, name and address of the entity responsible for the accounting registry 
Bonds will be exclusively represented as book entries, in accordance with Article 5.9 of Law 
19/1992, and will be constituted as such following their inscription in the corresponding 
accounting register.  
The entity in charge of the accounting registry of the Bonds shall be IBERCLEAR, with its 
address in Madrid, at Calle Pedro Teixeira, number 8, and its participating entities, selected in 
accordance with Article 45 Royal Decree 116/1992, February 14. 
Bondholders will be identified as such (on their behalf or on behalf of third parties) as a result of 
IBERCLEAR’s accounting registry, designated to carry out the accounting registry of the Bonds 
in the Fondo Regulations and to attend the clearing of to the Bonds in accordance with the rules 
established or to be established by IBERCLEAR for securities traded in the AIAF market.  
II.6.  Amount of the Bonds Issue, in nominal Euros, number of Bonds and amount of each 
one. 
The total amount of the issue will be 1,000,000,000 Euros represented as book entries of 
100,000 nominal Euros each one. 10,000 Bonds in four Series will be issued.  
A Series will be integrated by 9,620 A Bonds, for a total amount of 962,000,000 Euros. 
B Series will be integrated by 173 B Bonds, for a total amount of 17,300,000 Euros. 
C Series will be integrated by 142 C Bonds, for a total amount of 14,200,000 Euros. 
D Series will be integrated by 65 D Bonds, for a total amount of 6,500,000 Euros. 
II.7.  Nominal value of each security. 
The price of issue of each Bond shall be 100,000 Euros, equal to 100% of its nominal value. 
Each Bond shall be redimed in 100,000 Euros equivalent to its nominal value. 


 CHAPTER II – Information relating to the securities issued 
8 
II.8.  Commissions and all types of related expenses to be borne by the investors from the 
subscription of securities issued by the Fondo. 
The above price of issue is free of taxes and subscription charges for the subscriber.  
II.9.  Commissions to be borne by the Bondholders. 
The commission derived from the registration at IBERCLEAR’s will be paid by the Fondo and 
will not be transferred. There is no charge for balance management. 
Furthermore, IBERCLEAR’s participating entities may freely establish, in accordance with 
current legislation, new commissions and expenses to be paid by the Bond holder as a result of 
security management, previously notified to the Bank of Spain and/or the CNMV as supervising 
entities. 
II.10.  Interest. 
II.10.1. 
Nominal Interest. 
Bond interest payment will take place, in accordance with the priority of payments 
established in section V.4.2 of this Prospectus. Bonds will accrue interests during each 
Interest Accrual defined as the time period existing between two Payment Dates (including 
the first and excluding the last). The first Interest Accrual Period will begin on the Closing 
Date (including this date) and will end on the first Payment Date, September 22, 2004 
(excluding this date).  
All Bonds will accrue a variable annual nominal interest rate paid quarterly, over the 
Outstanding Nominal Balance of the Bonds at the beginning of the accrual period, from the 
Closing Date until their total maturity. 
The applicable interest rate for each Series of Bonds during each Accrual Period will be the 
sum of (i) the Reference Interest Rate, as established in the following section, equal for all 
Series of Bonds and rounded to the nearest thousandth of a percentage point, taking into 
account that, in the case that the proximity for the rounding up or down is identical, such 
rounding will be effected upwards, plus (ii) the margin applicable to each Series of Bonds, as 
is established below. 
Reference Interest Rate: The Reference Interest Rate for the determination of the applicable 
interest rate for the Bonds of all Series will be the 3-month EURIBOR, or a substitute if 
necessary, and will be determined as follows. Said Reference Interest Rate will also be 
applied on the first Interest Accrual Period.  
Determination of the Reference Interest Rate for the Bonds: The determination of 
EURIBOR will conform to the rules described in this section. 
On each Determination Date, the Sociedad Gestora will determine the Reference Interest 
Rate equal to the EURIBOR, as follows:  
(i) 
The 3-month EURIBOR rate published on the REUTERS’ screen, EURIBOR= page at 
11:00 am Central European Time of the Determination Date. “REUTERS’ screen, 


 CHAPTER II – Information relating to the securities issued 
9 
EURIBOR= page" is the page that reflects the contents of page "EURIBOR=" on the 
REUTERS MONITOR MONEY RATES SERVICE (or any other page that might 
replace it in this service). 
 
(ii) 
In absence of the rates indicated in part (i) the Reference Interest Rate shall be that of 
the 3-month EURIBOR rate on the Determination Date which appears on 
“TELERATE” screen (TELERATE SPAIN, S.A.), page 248, (or any other page that 
might replace it in this service) at 11:00 am C.E.T.. 
(iii) 
In absence of the rates indicated in parts (i) and (ii) Reference Interest Rate shall be the 
average of the Madrid 3-month interbank interest rates for Euro-denominated deposit 
operations declared, simultaneously, on the Determination Date by the following 
institutions: 
- Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria  
- Banco Santander Central Hispano 
- Confederación Española de Cajas de Ahorros 
- Deutsche Bank 
In the event that one of the above institutions does not supply quotes, the applicable 
rate shall be the average of the rates declared by at least two of the remaining 
institutions.  
(iv) 
In the event that the rates cannot be determined by the above mentioned procedures (i), 
(ii), and (iii), the applicable rate shall be that which was applicable for the previous 
Interest Accrual Period. 
The Sociedad Gestora will keep copy of REUTERS or TELERATE´s pages, or in its case, 
the supplied quotes of the institutions mentioned in part (iii), as documentation of the type of 
EURIBOR established. 
Determination Date of the Reference Interest Rate and the Interest Rate of the Bonds: 
The Determination Date for the Reference Interest Rate for each accrual period will be the 
second Business Day before the Payment Date (or the Closing Date in the case of the first 
Interest Accrual Period) which marks the beginning of the corresponding accrual period.  
Once the Reference Interest Rate for the Bonds has been determined, and on the same 
Determination Date, the Sociedad Gestora will calculate and determine for each Series of 
Bond the applicable interest rate for the following accrual period. 
Margin to be applied to the Interest Rate for each Series of Bonds: For the whole life of 
the transaction the margins to be applied to the Refference Interest Rate, determined in the 
previous paragraph, to calculate the interest rate for each Series of Bonds will be determined, 
as follows, in between the values included in the following table:

II.10.2. 
Dates, place, entities and procedure for the payment of coupons 
Bond interest of all Series will be paid each quarter, on March, June, September and 
December 22 of each year until the total redemption of the Bonds. In the event that any of 
these days is not a Business Day, the following Business Day. 
In the event that, on a Payment Date, and regardless of the mechanisms established to protect 
the rights of the Bondholders, the Available Resources of the Fondo are not sufficient to 
attend the interest payment obligations of the Fondo, in accordance with section V.4.2., the 
amount available for the payment of interest will be distributed in accordance with the 
priority order of payments established in said section and, in the event that the Available 
Resources are only sufficient to pay some obligations in the same order of priority, the 
amount available will be distributed proportionately among the Bonds affected, in proportion 


 CHAPTER II – Information relating to the securities issued 
12 
to their Outstanding Nominal Balance. Those amounts which remain outstanding will be paid 
on the following Payment Date possible, without accruing additional interest. Outstanding 
payments to Bondholders will take place on the following Payment Date (if there are 
sufficient Available Resources to do so) immediately prior to the payments due to the 
Bondholders of that same Series and which correspond to the current period. The priority 
order is covered in section V.4.2. of this Prospectus. 
Existing withholdings, rates or taxes or to be established in the future, in relation to capital, 
interest or yield of these Bonds, shall be born exclusively by the Bondholders and the amount 
will be deducted, when necessary, by the corresponding entity in the legally established 
procedure. 
Payment will be made through the Paying Agent designating IBERCLEAR and its 
participating entities to distribute the amounts. 
II.11.  Redemption of the Bonds. 
II.11.1. 
Redemption Price 
Bonds will be redeemed to 100,000 Euros each one, equal to its nominal value, free of 
expenses and taxes for the Bond holder and to be paid on each Payment Date of principal, as 
is established in the following sections. 
II.11.2. 
Amortization of the Bonds. 
The amortization of the Bonds will take place pro rata among the Bonds of each Serie, 
through a reduction of the nominal amount, until said nominal amount is completed. The 
amortization of the B Bonds will begin following the full amortization of the A Bonds. The 
amortization of the C Bonds will begin following the full amortization of the B Bonds. The 
amortization of the D Bonds will begin following the full amortization of the C Bonds. 
On each Payment Date, the Available Amount for Amortizations, in accordance with the 
Priority Order of Payments and the above subordination rule, will be the lowest of the 
following: 
(a) The positive difference on said Payment Date between the Outstanding Nominal Balance 
of the Bonds (prior to the amortization to take place on said Payment Date) and the 
Outstanding Nominal Balance not due of the Non-defaulted Mortgage Share Certificates of 
the last day of the month prior to the Payment Date, calculated in accordance with the 
amortization table of the Mortgage Loan portfolio, without taking into account the amount 
corresponding to the prepayments of the calendar month prior to the current Payment Date; 
and 
(b) The Available Resources on said Payment Date, minus the amounts corresponding to the 
items described in sections (i) through (vii) of section V.4.2. of this Prospectus. 
The defaulted Mortgage Share Certificates (with delayed payments above 12 months) will 
imply the amortization of an amount equal to their Outstanding Nominal Balance of Bonds 
on the Payment Date immediately following the one in which they were declared defaulted. 
For said amortization the Available Resources of the Fondo will be used, once all the prior 


 CHAPTER II – Information relating to the securities issued 
13 
compromises on the priority order described in section V.4.2. have been met. In the event that 
there are no Available Resources to effect these payments, the corresponding amounts will 
remain outstanding until the following Payment Date. 
 
II.11.3. 
Amortization of A Bonds. 
The amortization of the A Bonds will take place through the reduction of the nominal amount, 
until its completion, on each Payment Date. The amortization of the A Series will begin on the 
first Payment Date, including this date. The amount to be amortized by each A Bond will be the 
result of the pro rata distribution among all the securities in the Series of the Available Amount 
for Amortization and always in accordance with the priority order of payments established in 
V.4.2. of this Prospectus. 
II.11.4. 
Amortization of Principal of the B Bonds. 
The amortization of the B Bonds will begin following the full amortization of the A Bonds. 
The amortization of the B Bonds will take place pro rata among the B Bonds through the 
reduction of the nominal amount, until its completion, for an amount equal to the Available 
Amount for Amortization on each Payment Date; always in accordance with the priority order of 
payments established in V.4.2. of this Prospectus. 
II.11.5. 
Amortization of Principal of the C Bonds. 
The amortization of the C Bonds will begin following the full amortization of the B Bonds. 
The amortization of the C Bonds will take place pro rata among the C Bonds through the 
reduction of the nominal amount, until its completion, for an amount equal to the Available 
Amount for Amortization on each Payment Date; always in accordance with the priority order of 
payments established in V.4.2. of this Prospectus. 
II.11.6. 
Amortization of Principal of the D Bonds. 
The amortization of the D Bonds will begin following the full amortization of the C Bonds. 
The amortization of the D Bonds will take place pro rata among the D Bonds through the 
reduction of the nominal amount, until its completion, for an amount equal to the Available 
Amount for Amortization on each Payment Date; always in accordance with the priority order of 
payments established in V.4.2. of this Prospectus. 
II.11.7. 
Maturity of the Bonds issued 
The maturity of the Bonds will take place on the Date in which they are fully amortized or on 
the Date of Liquidation of the Fondo. 
The final payment date for the Loans grouped in the securitized portfolio is December 31, 
2038. 


 CHAPTER II – Information relating to the securities issued 
14 
II.11.8. 
Examples of Bond Amortization 
As an example, and without prejudice to previous sections, on June 22, 2007, an amount of 
the Outstanding Nominal Balance of the A Bonds will be amortized, equal to the pro rata 
distribution among each one of the Available Amount for Amortization, and always in 
accordance with the priority order of payments established in section V.4.2. of this 
Prospectus. As a consequence, the following reduction of nominal of each A Bond will take 
place, in an amount equal to the pro rata distribution among each one of (i) the amount 
received from the Issuer, from February 28, 2007 until May 31, 2007, as principal of the non-
defaulted Mortgage Share Certificates, in accordance with the amortization program of the 
Loans, including the Technical Advance received on said Payment Date; plus (ii) the amount 
received from the Issuer, as Loan servicer, from January 31, 2007 until February 28,  2007, as 
prepaid amortization principal from the Mortgage Share Certificates; and plus (iii) the 
matured and uncollected principal of the Mortgage Share Certificates and the outstanding 
nominal from the Mortgage Share Certificates declared defaulted since the previous Payment 
Date.  
 
Publicity of the amounts due and entities through which the financial service of the 
issue will be attended: Payment of interest and principal will be notified through channels 
generally accepted by the market that grant the reasonable broadcasting of the information, 
both in time and content. 
 
Notification Dates for the payments to be made by the Fondo on each Payment Date: 
payments to the Bondholders, both for principal and interest, will be notified in the first 22 
days of the month prior to the Payment Date, except in August, when the notification will 
take place in the first week of September. 
 
Early Liquidation of the Fondo: in virtue of Article 5 of Law 19/1992, the Sociedad 
Gestora is empowered to proceed to the early liquidation of the Fondo when the Outstanding 
Nominal Balance of the Mortgage Share Certificates is below 10% of the initial balance, in 
the event that the liquidation of the assets of the Fondo allows to meet all liability with  the 
Bondholders accordingly with the priority order of payments of section V.4.2. 
II.12.  Financial Service of the Fondo 
The financial service of the issue will be attended through the Paying Agent. The Sociedad 
Gestora will agree with Banco Popular the terms of this role. 
 
The Average Life of the Bonds for different CPR, under the assumptions of section V.1.1.,

Duration of the Bonds: The concept of duration, applied to a fixed-income bond, according 
to Macaulay’s commonly used definition, is a measure of the sensitivity of the asset’s value 
in relation to the modification of a market yield rate. In essence, the duration is a measure of 
the sensitivity of the value of a bond to the change of its yield references in the market. As a 
result, this risk has different interpretations for variable or fixed rate bonds. 
Considering Bonds issued by the Fondo IM PASTOR 2 as fixed rate throughout the life of 
the Bond, with a quarterly coupon for each Bond equal to the following, the duration 
resulting from the application of Macaulay’s adjusted formula, expressed in years, and for

Pn= Time elapsed (in years) between the Closing Date and each Payment Date. 
VAn= Current value of each of the total amounts to be paid to the investors on account of 
principal and interest, on an quarterly basis, discounted annually at the applicable interest 
rate. 
PE= Price of issue of the Bonds, 100,000 Euros. 
I= Applicable annual interest rate. 
Nevertheless, in relation with duration, it must be taken into account that the Bonds issued by the 
Fondo IM PASTOR 2 are variable-rate, and the consequences of this are explained below. 
During the periods between interest rate revision dates, the market price of a variable-rate Bond 
will vary if market interest rates change. Nevertheless, its price always approximates par on a 
revision date, as on that date, the cost of holding the Bond may be financed under similar market 
conditions, with respect to the Bond, to those at the Date of Subscription. The price may not 
equal par on such a date if certain conditions (market reference, applicable margin, revision 
period, average life, final amortization, etc.) at that moment are valued differently by the market 
(better or worse) than the available investment alternatives. With this exception, however, it can 
be assumed that the price of a variable interest rate Bond is par on its interest rate revision dates. 
As a consequence of the above, the duration of a variable-rate Bond must behave in a manner 
similar to a fixed-rate, zero-coupon Bond with maturity on the same date as the interest rate 
revision date of the variable-rate Bond. Therefore, on a given date, the approximate duration of 
the Bonds, with a period of revision of three months, can be assumed to be the remaining term 
until the next interest rate revision. 
The value for duration mentioned in the above paragraph is the result of the application of the 
concept defined by Macaulay, but taking into consideration that changes in market interest rates

will modify the flow of Bond payments (in favor of the Bondholder) which does not occur in the 
case of fixed-rate Bonds. 
The prepayment risk of the Bond, that is, the uncertain character of the amounts amortized on 
each date of payment and the revision of interest, will affect the duration of the Bond in a 
very different manner depending on whether its interest rate is fixed or variable. While the 
effect is very important in the case of a fixed-rate Bond, in which case the duration is highly 
dependent on the average life of the Bond, it is not as important in the case of a variable-rate 
Bond, since in this case the duration does not depend on the average life of the Bond but 
rather on the remaining term until the next modification of the interest rate. 
II.13.  Net Effective Interest Rate for the Bondholder. 
The Internal Rate of Return must take into account the date and price of purchase of the Bond, 
the quarterly payment of the coupon and the amortizations, following the established calendar 
and taking into account early amortizations. 
As an example, on the Closing Date, with the nominal interest rates for each Bond indicated in 
the following table, constant during the life of the Fondo, paid quarterly, a price per Bond of 
100% and using the amortization table of this same section –derived from the application to the 
portfolio of the 10% constant early amortization assumption- the Internal Rate of Return for the 
holder of each Bond would be:

IMPORTANT NOTE FOR THE INVESTOR 
The information included in the following tables is presented for illustrative purposes only, it does 
not represent the Fondo’s specific payment obligations to third parties on the dates or periods to 
which they correspond. The data have been elaborated under assumptions including Non-Payment 
or Early Amortization of the loans subject to change, and as a consequence, investors interested in 
the Fondo’s anticipated payment calendar should request the information from the institutions 
authorized to distribute it, the Sociedad Gestora, the AIAF Market and the CNMV. Nevertheless, 
this information is also available through the Underwriters and other entities active in the secondary 
market. As indicated in section III.5, the Sociedad Gestora undertakes to make this information 
public.

market –these circumstances being relevant to establish taxation- it is assumed they will comply 
with the requirements. Furthermore, it has been considered that the Bonds, at the time of issue, 
will be considered financial assets with a fixed return when this qualification is relevant to 
taxation.

interest or return of the Bonds will be assigned to the Bondholders, and the amount will be 
deducted in the form legally established.

date of the Prospectus, and with a merely informative nature, in the understanding that the 
regime may change when the current legislation is modified.

may be subject to special rules.

Returns obtained by Bondholders subject to the Income Tax for Individuals, from their interest, 
transfer, refound or amortization will be considered returns of private property capital obtained 
through the sale to third parties of said capital in the terms established in Article 23.2. of 
Legislative Royal Decree 3/2004, March 5, approving the new text for the Income Tax for 
Individuals. 
In this sense, in the event that returns derived from the perception of Bond coupons (interest), the 
complete return will be determined by the amount of interest received, including the withholding 
from the Income Tax for Individuals applied.  
Also, in the event of the sale, reimbursement or amortization of the Bonds, the difference 
between the value of sale, reimbursement or amortization (minus sale accessory expenses 
properly  justified) and the value of purchase or subscription (plus purchase accessory rights 
properly justified) will be considered as returns subject to taxation Nevertheless, negative returns 
derived from the sale of Bonds, when the contributor has acquired other homogeneous financial 
assets in the two months prior or following said sale, will be included as the Bonds which are 
part of the contributor’s net worth are sold. 
Net return will be determined by deducting the management and trust expenses of the Bonds 
from the total returns, whenever said expenses do not correspond with the undertaking of a 
discretional and individual management of the investment portfolio. Net returns derived from the 
sale, reimbursement or amortization of the Bonds with a generation return above 2 years will be 
reduced in 40%. 
Initially, the returns received as interest are subject to 15% withholding as Income Tax for 
Individuals. 
There is no obligation to withhold returns derived from the sale or reimbursement of the Bonds 
which are represented as book entries and traded in a Spanish official secondary market, except 
the proportion of the price equivalent to the accrued non paid coupon in sales carried out in the 
30 days immediately prior to the maturity of the coupon, when (i) the purchaser is an individual 
or entity non resident  in Spain or is subject to Corporate Tax, and (ii) the explicit returns derived 
from sold securities are exempt from the obligation to withhold in respect of the purchaser. 
a.2. Corporation Tax. 
Returns obtained from Bonds purchased by entities subject to Corporation Tax will follow Title 
IV of Legislative Royal Decree 4/2004, March 5, which approves the new text of the Corporate 
Tax Law. 
These returns will not be subject to withholding from the Corporation Tax of the perceiver, in 
accordance with Article 57.q. of Royal Decree 537/1997, April 14, approving the Regulations 
for Corporation Tax. Nevertheless, they must comply with the following – as has been arranged 


 CHAPTER II – Information relating to the securities issued 
31 
for this issue- and with the procedure set out by Ministerial Order December 22, 1999 (published 
in the Official State Bulletin on December 29, 1999): 
1. They must be represented as book entries. 
2. They must be listed in a Spanish Official securities secondary market. 
b). Individuals or Corporations non-residents in Spain 
Returns obtained by Bondholders which are subject to Income Tax for Non Residents, from their 
interest, transfer, refund or amortization will be considered returns obtained in Spain, with or 
without permanent residency, in the terms set out in Article 13 of Legislative Royal Decree 
5/2004, March 5, approving the new text of the Income Tax for Non Residents and Tax 
Regulations. 
1. Returns obtained through permanent residency. 
Bond returns obtained through permanent residency in Spain will be taxed in accordance with 
the rules of Chapter III of Law 5/2004, without affecting Treaties to avoid double taxation 
signed by Spain which may establish exemption or the application of reduced rates. These 
returns will be exempt from the Income Tax for Non Residents in the above terms for 
Corporation Tax. 
2. Returns obtained without permanent residency. 
Bond returns obtained by individuals or corporations which do not reside in Spain and which act, 
therefore, without permanent residency, will be taxed in accordance with Chapter IV of Law 
5/2004, of which the following opposing situations may be highlighted, without affecting the 
exemption or reduced rates established by the Treaties to avoid Double Taxation signed by 
Spain: 
- 
The tax rate will be quantified in the total amount of the return obtained, calculated in 
accordance with Law 3/2004, and without applying the deductions covered by this Law.  
- 
In the event of transfer, refund or amortization, related expenses will be taken into account 
when calculating the return if they are sufficiently justified. Taxation will take place 
separately for each total or partial accrual of taxed return, and there will be no compensation 
between them. 
- 
Bond returns, from interest or sale, reimbursement or amortization, will be exempt when 
they are obtained without mediation of a permanent establishment by residents in another 
state of the European Union or by permanent establishments of said residents in other states 
of the European Union (Article 14.1.c of Law 5/2004). 
- 
Equally exempt will be the returns derived from the sale of those securities in any Spanish 
official secondary market, obtained by individuals or entities which are not resident and 
without the mediation of a permanent establishment in Spain, but resident in a State which 
has subscribed with Spain a Treaty to Avoid Double Taxation with a clause for the exchange 
of information. 
- 
Under no circumstance will the two above mentioned exemptions be applied when returns 
are obtained through countries or territories legally defined as off-shore banking centers. 


 CHAPTER II – Information relating to the securities issued 
32 
- 
The Tax will be calculated applying the rate of 15%  except when a lower rate is applicable 
as a result of an internal ruling or a Treaty signed with Spain. When, as a result of the 
residency of an investor, the Treaty to Avoid Double Taxation is  applicable, the rate to be 
applied will be the reduced one established in said Treaty for this type of returns. 
- 
The application of any exemption or reduced rate established by the internal rule or the 
Treaty signed with Spain, will require the appropriate certification of the tax residency of the 
investor through the forwarding of a tax residency certificate issued by the authorities of the 
country in which the investor resides in accordance with Spanish legislation. 
- 
On the other hand, coupons derived from Bonds are, initially, subject to withholding except 
when the origin of the exemption or the payment of the tax is certified. The amount withheld 
will be an amount equivalent to the final Tax. 
- 
In accordance with Ministerial Order April 13, 2002, for the cases in which the payment of 
interest derived from Bonds is carried out by financial entities registered, resident or 
represented in Spain, which are trustees or managers of the collection of the return of said 
securities, the tax exemption or the reduced rate resulting from the Treaties to Avoid Double 
Taxation will be carried out as follows: 
o The Sociedad Gestora, in the name and on behalf of the Fondo, as issuing entity, will pay 
the trustees, through the Paying Agent, the liquid amount which results from the 
application of the general withholding rate current on that date, to the total amount of 
interest. 
o Before the 10th of the month following the maturity of each coupon, the trustees will 
forward to the Sociedad Gestora or the Paying Agent, a detailed report of the subjects 
liable for the tax for non-residents obtaining returns in Spain without the mediation of 
permanent establishment, with their identification details, the number of securities they 
hold on the date of maturity of each coupon, the gross returns and the amount withheld. 
o Bondholders subject to the non-resident income tax without permanent establishment in 
Spain must certify to their trustees their right to be subject to the Treaty, or the exemption 
from withholding. The trustees will elaborate a list indicated above including the holders 
of securities liable at the moment of notifying the Sociedad Gestora. 
- 
The Sociedad Gestora, as soon as it receives the list mentioned above, will immediately 
proceed to pay, through the Payment Agent, the amount withheld to the trustees. 
- 
The trustees will immediately pay the amount withheld in excess to the holders subject to 
income tax for non-residents. 
- 
In order to certify the right to withhold according to the Treaty or the exemption, 
contributors must justify their tax residency through the following documentation: 
o When the exemption is the result of applying Spanish regulations, through a certificate of 
residency issued by the tax authorities of the country of residence. 
o When the exemption or reduced rate is the result of the application of a Treaty, through a 
certificate issued by the corresponding tax authority, including a declaration that the 
contributor resides in accordance with the Treaty. Nevertheless, the application of a rate 


 CHAPTER II – Information relating to the securities issued 
33 
derived from a Treaty in which an Order establishes the use of a specific form, said form 
will be presented in place of the certificate. 
Residency certificates mentioned above have a validity of one year from the date in which they 
were issued. 
- 
If it is not possible to certify, in this manner, fiscal residency, the returns obtained from the 
Bonds both for interest and as a result of their sale, reimbursement or amortization, by 
holders which are not residents, will be subject to the general rate of taxation mentioned 
above. Nevertheless, they will be able to request the return of the excess withheld following 
the procedure established in the current legislation. 
- 
 On the other hand, and independent from the taxation, returns derived from the sale or 
reimbursement of the Bonds will not be subject to withholding as they are Bonds with an 
explicit yield represented as book entries and traded in a Spanish official secondary market, 
in the terms and conditions established by Article 70.3.f of the Regulations for the Income 
Tax for Individuals, following Article 14.3.b of the Regulations for the Income Tax of non 
residents. This is without prejudice to the responsibility of said trustee or Bond manager, and 
the obligations of declaring and forwarding the final Taxation of the non resident. 
c). Direct taxation on the sale of Bonds 
The sale of securities is exempt from the Stamp Tax (Impuesto sobre Transmisiones 
Patrimoniales y Actos Jurídicos Documentados and Value Added Tax). 
d). Net Worth Tax 
Individuals subject to Net Worth Tax that hold Bonds on December 31st of each year must 
include them, for their average trading value on the fourth quarter of each year, in their taxation. 
Individuals non residents in Spain and which are subject to Net Worth Tax will also be subject to 
the tax, except in those circumstances covered by Treaties to avoid Double Taxation. 
Nevertheless, Bonds with returns exempt from the Taxation for Non-Residents, will be exempt. 
e). Inheritance Tax 
The transfer of Bonds as a result of death or donation in favor of individuals is subject to the 
general rules of the Inheritance Tax. In the event that the beneficiary is a corporation, the return 
obtained will be taxed, if applicable, in accordance with Corporation Tax or Income Tax for Non 
Residents and without prejudice to the Agreements to Avoid Double Taxation which may be 
applicable. 
II.23.  Purpose of the transaction. 
The amount issued by the Fondo is destined, exclusively, to the subscription of Mortgage Share 
Certificates.

are selected from a selection of mortgage loans of 9,913 audited loans. The Audit took place on 
June 4, 2004 and is mentioned in Chapter I. Section IV.4. of this Chapter includes the 
characteristics of the 9,828 loan extracted minus those that did not comply with the requisites

the transaction, nor will it offer guarantees or warranties, nor will it enter into Mortgage Share 
Certificates repurchase agreements as a result of the Fondo Regulations or any other pact or

50 
Rights conferred to the Fondo for the subscription of the Mortgage Share Certificates: the 
Fondo, as holder of the Mortgage Share Certificates, will hold all rights recognized in current 
legislation, and in the Mortgage Share Certificates. Specifically, it will have the right to receive 
all payments made, for any concept, by the Mortgage Loan debtors from the Closing Date, 
together with any other payment derived from the Mortgage Loans, if they correspond to the 
Mortgage Share Certificates. 
Together with the payments made by the Mortgage Loan debtors, the Fondo will receive any 
other payment received by the Issuer, as servicer of the loans, including those derived from any 
accessory right to each loan, such as compensation derived from insurance policies, payments 
made by possible guarantors, etc., with the exception of delinquent interest, unpaid receipt 
claims, subrogation commissions and prepayment, together with any other commission which 
will correspond to the Issuer of the Mortgage Share Certificates. The Issuer will make the 
necessary notifications so that the payments to the Sociedad Gestora are made. The Issuer must 
undertake reasonable efforts to maintain with full effects insurance policies subscribed in 
relation to the Mortgage Loans, and they will be responsible for any damages to the Fondo in the 
event the insurance policies have not been maintained.  
The issuer will grant all possible rights to the Sociedad Gestora so that it can notify the sale to 
the Debtors of the Mortgage Loans when it considers necessary. In particular, the Sociedad 
Gestora will notify the sale to the Debtors of the Mortgage Loans in the event of the replacement 
of the Issuer as servicer of the Mortgage Loans if there is no legal impediment to do so, and in 
the event of any situation of insolvency, bankrupt, or the administrative or judicial intervention 
of the Issuer. 
IV.1.3. Replacement of the Mortgage Share Certificates 
In the exceptional circumstances in which, despite the declarations made by the Issuer and its 
efforts to ensure correspondence, a particular Mortgage Loan on the Date of the Constitution of 
the Fondo or the Closing Date, does not comply with the representations set out in section IV.4. 
below, the Issuer will undertake: 
(A) To replace the corresponding Mortgage Share Certificates by another one with similar 
financial characteristics in terms of amount, term to maturity and interest rate, and that is 
acceptable to the Sociedad Gestora, prior consultation with the Rating Agencies. 
In any case, in the event of replacement of a Mortgage Share Certificates, the Issuer will declare 
that the Share is in accordance with the conditions referred to in section IV.4. of this Prospectus. 
The Issuer, as soon as it becomes aware that a Share issued does not correspond to the cited 
representations, will inform the Sociedad Gestora and indicate the Mortgage Loans that will be 
presented to replace the faulty Mortgage Share Certificates. In the event that any of the Shares 
are substituted in accordance with these provisions, the Issuer will issue a new Multiple Deed, 
which will be substituted for the one provided in accordance with the Fondo Regulations. 
(B) In addition to the obligations assumed in paragraph (A), and in the exceptional cases in 
which, even though the Issuer has fulfilled these obligations, the substitution is not possible 
because the available Mortgage Loans, for reasons not attributable to the Issuer, are not similar 
to the securitized portfolio in terms of (i) amount, (ii) term to maturity, (iii) interest rate, (iv) 
characteristics of the borrower, or (v) characteristics of the mortgaged property, and the lack of 
conformity of any of these elements with respect to the affected Share is sufficiently important 


 CHAPTER IV – Information relating to the assets securitised through the Fondo

Bondholders, in the justified opinion of the Sociedad Gestora, which will so inform the Issuer 
and the CNMV, the Issuer will agree to reimburse the outstanding principal of the corresponding 
Share and the interest accrued and unpaid to date.

Service Contract. 
IV.1.5. Compensation

credit right against the Issuer, and, therefore, any of the Mortgage Loans is set off in full or in 
part, against said credit right, the Issuer will remedy such circumstance or, if not possible, will 
forward to the Fondo the amount compensated plus the interest accrued which should have 
corresponded to the Fondo until the day of the transfer, calculated in accordance with the 
applicable conditions of the corresponding Mortgage Loan. 
IV.2.  Management of the Mortgage Loans 
In accordance with article 61 (3) of Royal Decree 685/1982, of March 17th, the Issuer has 
undertaken to maintain the servicing of the Mortgage Loans from which the Shares are derived, 
remaining responsible to undertake whatever actions are necessary for the effective collection of 
the Mortgage Loans. In any case, the Sociedad Gestora, on behalf of the Fondo, will undertake to 
exercise all powers that, in the case of default in the payment by the borrower, correspond to the 
holders of Mortgage Shares in article 66 of Royal Decree 685/1982.  
All taxes, direct or indirect, charges or expenses accrued and incurred by the Issuer or those that 
must pass on in relation to the evolution of the services of the administration of the Mortgage 
Loans, without prejudice to its right to receive reimbursement from the debtors or from the Fondo 
in the event of their recovery.

success of the Mortgage Loans and of the rights derived from said Loans for the Mortgage Share

To this effect, the Issuer, as loan servicer, will carry out any action it considers necessary or 
convenient, having the powers and faculty to do so.  
In general, the Issuer, in relation to the Loans it administers will declare to the Sociedad Gestora 
and the Fondo that it will:  


 CHAPTER IV – Information relating to the assets securitised through the Fondo 
52 
(i)

or extra-judicial proceedings. 
(ii) 
Take all necessary and indicated measures to maintain or execute the guarantees and  other 
obligations arising from the Mortgage Loans. 
(iii) 
Take into account the interests of the Bondholders in their relations with the debtors and in the 
exercising of any discretionary power resulting from performance of the services specified in 
the Fondo Regulations and in this Prospectus. 
(iv)

(v) 
Obtain and maintain in full force licenses, approvals, authorizations and consents that may be 
necessary for the implementation of its services. 
(vi) 
Have at their disposal sufficient equipment and staff to fulfill all their duties. 
Specifically, the Issuer, as Loan servicer, will dedicate the same attention and will upply the same level 
of ability, detail and diligence in said administration, as would employ in the administration of 
mortgage loans not sold, and in any event, will exercise a reasonable level of ability, detail and 
diligence when undertaking its services. It will carry out, among others, the following tasks: 
(vii) Keep under safe custody all the deeds, documents, files and any other accessories of the Mortgage 
Loans, together with any relevant documents. The Issuer shall not relinquish possession, custody or 
control thereof, unless there is previous written consent from the Sociedad Gestora, in the name of the 
Fondo; 
(viii) Continue to collect all the amounts due and payable, by virtue of the Mortgage Loans or any 
accessory right thereto, and will make their best effort so as to ensure that all payments to be made by 
the debtors or by any other person, by virtue of the Mortgage Loans or any accessory right thereto, are 
collected, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the referred Mortgage Loans, on the 
corresponding dates. Notwithstanding the above, the Sociedad Gestora, if it so considers it necessary 
for the better defense of the rights of the Bondholders, may demand that the payment of the amounts 
administered by the Issuer are directly transferred into the Fondo’s Account. (ix) In the event of delay 
in the payments from the debtors of the shared Mortgage Loans, the Issuer, as Loan servicer, shall take 
the usual steps to remedy such situation, described in Clause 10.6 and in Annex 11 of the Fondo 
Regulations. 
The Issuer, in respect of the Mortgage Share Certificates it administers, is authorized to modify their 
management criteria, whenever the modifications do not derive in a deterioration of the Mortgage 
Share Certificates and the Sociedad Gestora is notified and the rating granted to the Bonds by the 
Rating Agencies is not negatively affected in any way.

Fondo, in respect of the Bonds, or of the obligations of any Debtor of any Mortgage Loan. 
Specifically, the Issuer, as Loan servicer, will not be responsible for any loss, responsibility, claim or 
expense incurred by the Sociedad Gestora or the Fondo as a result of the Issuer’s undertaking of its 
obligations as Loan servicer, except when such loss, responsibility, claim, expense or damage is the 
result of a negligence or breach of the Issuer in respect of the Mortgage Share Certificates 


 CHAPTER IV – Information relating to the assets securitised through the Fondo 
53 
administered, or any breach of its obligations under the Fondo Regulations. In this case, the Issuer will 
compensate the Fondo or the Sociedad Gestora for the damages and losses experienced (duly justified 
by the Sociedad Gestora) as a result of said negligence or breach. 
In any event, the Fondo, through the Sociedad Gestora, will enjoy the legal actions available against 
the Issuer if it is in breach of its obligations, as a result of the contracts subscribed with the Sociedad 
Gestora. 
In accordance with the powers established by Royal Decree 1289/1991, August 2, for the holder of 
Mortgage Share Certificates, and taking into account that the Sociedad Gestora receives information on 
a monthly basis, concerning the situation of each one of the Mortgage Loans, the Sociedad Gestora, on 
behalf of the Fondo, will use the powers granted by article 66 of said Royal Decree in those cases in 
which it considers that all the procedures followed by the Issuer, as servicer of the loans in arrears, do 
not  correspond to the best possible defense of the interests of the Bondholders. These powers are: 
Art. 66. Rights of the holders. In the event of the non-fulfillment of the conditions owing to the lack of 
payments by the debtor, the holder or holders of the Mortgage Share Certificates, it will have the 
following rights: 
a) To require the Issuer to initiate the foreclosure procedures of the Mortgage. 
b) To participate, with the same rights as the Issuer, in the foreclosure 
procedures brought by the latter against the borrower, being allowed to be 
present in any executory proceeding initiated. To participate in the amount 
recovered on a pro rata basis with respect to the percentage it holds in the 
foreclosed loan, without prejudice to the rights of the Issuer to receive any 
possible difference between the rate of interest of the loan and that of the 
Mortgage Share Certificates, when it is inferior. 
c) In the event that the Issuer does not initiate the procedures within the sixty 
calendar days following the notarized contractual request for payment of the 
debt, the holder of the Mortgage Share Certificates may initiate executory 
proceedings on its own account, with respect to the amount corresponding to 
the percentage of its share, with respect to both principal and interest. 
In this case, the amount of the loan which does not correspond to the percentage 
of its share and any Mortgage Share Certificates not executed will remain as 
preferential claims, provided that the liquidator accepts them as such and 
assumes the delegation of responsibility for such claims, without designation of

Collections of the payments of the Mortgage Loan Debtors. 
The Issuer, as Mortgage Loan servicer, will continue to collect all amounts due in virtue of the 
Mortgage Loans or of any other accessory right and will do its utmost to guarantee that all payments to 
be made by the borrowers or other individuals, in virtue of the Mortgage Loans or any other accessory 
right, are made, in accordance with the terms and conditions of said Mortgage Loans, on the 
corresponding date. 
In the event of Mortgage Loan debtor arrears, the Issuer, as servicer, will carry out the actions 
described in the Fondo Regulations, adopting the usual measures of a prudent lender in Spain, 
guaranteeing that such measures do not affect the management of the Fondo or the Rating assigned to 
the Bonds. 
Payments by the Issuer to the Reinvestment Account will take place monthly on each Transfer Date, 
that is, the 20th of each month, and will refer to the amount collected by the Issuer during the previous 
calendar month, plus the Technical Advances requested under special circumstances. 
The Issuer, as loan servicer, will have available the founds from the loans belonging to the Fondo, from 
the date in which the Issuer receives such amounts and until the Transfer Date. Returns obtained from 
said funds during that period will correspond to the Issuer. 
In the event of possible discrepancies between the Issuer and the Sociedad Gestora on the amounts 
collected and to be delivered to the Fondo on the Transfer Date, Amount Collected and Technical 
Advance, the parties shall try to solve such discrepancies, without prejudice to the fact that, if no 
agreement is reached before the Transfer Date, the Issuer will deliver, on a provisional basis, the 
amounts established by the Sociedad Gestora, to the Fondo. However, both parties may readjust said 
amount. 
During the life of the Fondo, the balance of the Reinvestment Account will not exceed at any given 
moment, 4% of the Outstanding Nominal Balance of the Bonds. Any amount exceeding such 
calculation will be immediately transferred to the Fondo’s Account. In the event that short term rating 
assigned by S&P to the Issuer is equal or above A-1, such transfer will not take place until said rating is 
maintained. 
Currently, the Issuer has a short term risk rating assigned by Moody’s of P1 and a long term rating of 
A2, and a short term rating assigned by S&P of A-2. In the event that Moody’s rating is reduced below 
P1 for short term or A3 for long term, or S&P’s is reduced below A-2, the Sociedad Gestora, on behalf 
of the Fondo, will, prior consultation with the Rating Agencies, carry out the following actions from 
the moment it is aware of such reduction: 
(i) 
Permanently transfer the Outstanding Balance of the Reinvestment Account, including the 
Reserve Fondo, to the Fondo’s Account. 
(ii) 
Transfer on a daily basis, and before 11 am (CET) any amounts collected by the Issuer from 
the Mortgage Loans, to the Fondo’s Account.

the Sociedad Gestora, and necessary to carry out its functions. 
IV.2.3. Modifications and Subrogations of the Mortgage Loans. 
In accordance with article 25 of Royal Decree 685/1982, March 17, the Issuer is not entitled, without 
the authorization of the Sociedad Gestora, to voluntarily cancel the Mortgages underlying the 
Mortgage Share Certificates for any other reason than payment of the Mortgage Loans, to waive or 
compound them, to make a novation of the Mortgage Loans, to remit or pardon them partially or in 
full, to prorogue them or, in general, carry out any act that might impair or decrease the rank, legal 
enforceability or economic value of the Mortgages or the Mortgage Loans except by the modifications 
outlined in the following paragraph. 
The Issuer, as loan servicer, will, from the date of the constitution of the Fondo, as long as the rating 
assigned to the Bonds is not impaired, that payments to the Fondo are not affected in a negative way, 
and that notice is given to the Sociedad Gestora and by the latter to the Rating Agency, is entitled to: 
(i) Permit subrogations of the Mortgage Loan contracts, provided that the characteristics of the new 
borrower are similar to those of the existing borrower and that these are consistent with the criteria

56 
(ii) Agree with the borrowers modifications in the rate of interest of the shared Loans, provided the 
commitments taken by the Issuer by virtue of the compromises referred to in this section are in full 
vigor. In respect of the modifications of interest and final maturity, this section and the Fondo 
Regulations must be followed. 
Modifications of the Interest Rate: In accordance with the Fondo Regulations, in the event that the 
Issuer agrees to modify the interest of a Mortgage Loan and, as a consequence of its Mortgage Share 
Certificates, the totality of the ordinary interest accrued by the Mortgage Loan will continue to 
correspond to the Fondo. 
Modifications of the Final Maturity of the Loans: In accordance with the Fondo Regulations, the Issuer 
may modify the final date of the maturity of the Mortgage Loans as long as the following conditions 
are met: 
a) That, in all cases, the periodicity of the amortization quotas of the principal of the Mortgage Loan is 
maintained or reduced, keeping the same amortization system. 
b) That the new maturity date is no later than December 31, 2038. 
c) That the Mortgage Loan has not suffered arrears in the last six months before the modification date 
and that the Loan is currently being paid. 
d) That the modification of the Mortgage Loan deed is granted with the mortgage borrower and that it 
is inscribed in the Property Register, maintaining the rank of first mortgage. 
e) That the expenses derived from the modification are born by the Issuer or loan debtor and in no case 
by the Fondo. 
f) That the amount resulting from the sum of the initial balance of the Mortgage Share Certificates with 
an extended maturity date is not above 5% of the initial balance of the Mortgage Share Certificates 
grouped in the Fondo. 
g) In no case will the Issuer, as loan servicer, decide without prior request from the mortgage debtor, 
the modification of the maturity date. The servicer will act taking into account the interests of the 
Fondo. 
The Sociedad Gestora, in representation of the Fondo, will, at any time during the life of the Fondo, 
cancel or suspend the modification of the final maturity date on behalf of the Issuer. 
In the event that the renegotiation of the interest rate of any Mortgage Loan, or the modification of its 
final maturity, the Issuer will immediately notify the Sociedad Gestora of the results of the negotiation. 
Also, the mortgage debtor may request the subrogation to the Issuer for the Mortgage Loans, under 
Law 2/1994. The subrogation of a new lender of the Mortgage Loan and the subsequent payment of the 
amount owed will force the early amortization of the Mortgage Loan and the Mortgage Share 
Certificate.

removed.

the portfolio information here included, in respect of the margins, has been calculated with the 
information provided by Banco Pastor: 
a) with the margins currently being applied to each loan that has reset its interest at least once; 
and 
b) with the margins that should be applied on the following reset date for those loans which are 
still to reset their interest. 
The Sociedad Gestora declares that the margins used for the following distributions may vary in 
the future, as a consequence of the application of the rules of each mortgage loan contract. 
None of the loans included in the tables have arrears above 90 days.

V.1.1. 
Assumptions 
The following tables refer to three possible scenarios (constant annual prepayment rates of 5, 
10 and 15%) which, in relation to income and payments made by the Fondo, could occur 
during the life of the Fondo and the present issue of the Bonds. 
In order to calculate these tables the data used have been obtained from the loan portfolio 
mentioned in the previous Chapter, on June 4, 2004. 
Mortgage Share Certificates  
• 
Volume of the loan portfolio from which the Mortgage Share Certificates are issued: 
999,999,964,79 Euros. 
• 
Interest Rate: 3.20%, without prejudice to revisions resulting from the following 
paragraph. 


 CHAPTER V – Financial Information of the Fondo 
70 
• 
Interest Rate for the Mortgage Share Certificates in each period: for the entire life of each 
Loan, a margin equal to the current margin on June 4, 2004, will be applied to each 
reference rate, in the terms established in section IV.5. of this Prospectus. From 
September 22, 2004, the reference interest rate used for the loans of the portfolio sold 
will be assumed constant, and its value equal to the reference interest rate of the Bonds. 
• 
The initial weighed average residual maturity for the Mortgage Share Certificates in the 
portfolio is 257 months. 
• 
Annual prepaid amortization rate assumed: 5, 10 and 15%. 
• 
Annual percentage of Defaulted Mortgage Loans: 0.3% annually from June 2005, and 
75% of recoveries a year later. 
Bonds: 
• 
Total amount: 1,000,000,000 Euros 
o A Bonds: 
962,000,000 Euros 
o B Bonds: 
17,300,000 Euros 
o C Bonds: 
14,200,000 Euros 
o D Bonds: 
6,500,000 Euros 
• 
Interest rate: Annual variable nominal interest, paid quarterly. The interest rate of the 
Bonds is the result of adding a 3-month EURIBOR to a margin of 0.160% for the A 
Bonds, 0.500% for the B Bonds, 0.900% for the C Bonds and 3.250% for the D Bonds. 
Other Resources Deposited: 
The difference between the amount corresponding to the bond issue and the balance of the 
Mortgage Share Certificates purchased by the Fondo is covered under paragraph “other 
resources deposited”. This amount, 35,21 Euros in the previous balance, will be deposited in 
the Reinvestment Account until the first Payment Date, date in which it will fully destined to 
the amortization of the Bonds. 
Subordinated Loan for Initial Expenses: 
• 
Amount: 895,103.93 Euros. The amount of this Subordinated Loan will be destined to pay 
the initial expenses of the Fondo. 
• 
Interest rate: annual variable interest rate equal to the Bond’s Reference Interest Rate 
during said period, plus a margin of 0.30%. 
• 
Amortization: 20 equal and consecutive quotas, the first of which will take place on the first 
Payment Date (September 22, 2004) and the following on the following Payment Dates. 
Subordinated Loan for First Period Interests: 


 CHAPTER V – Financial Information of the Fondo 
71 
• 
Amount: 900,000.00 Euros. The amount of this Subordinated Loan will be destined 
by the Sociedad Gestora to cover the unbalance corresponding to the first Payment 
Date of the Fondo, between the accrual and collection of interest from the Mortgage 
Share Certificates. 
• 
Interest rate: annual variable interest rate equal to the Reference Interest Rate of the 
Bonds during said period, plus a margin of 0.25%. 
• 
Amortization: on each Payment Date reducing the outstanding nominal balance in 
respect of the need for resources to cover the unbalance between the accrual and 
collection of interest of the Mortgage Share Certificates. 
Participative Loan: 
• 
Amount: 9,000,000 Euros. The amount of the loan will be destined to establish 
the Reserve Fondo. 
• 
Interest Rate: the remuneration of the Participative Loan will have two 
components, the first one will enjoy a fixed nature and will be equal to the 
interests accrued by the Outstanding Nominal Balance of the loan at an interest 
rate equal to the Reference Interest Rate for the Bonds during such period, plus a 
margin of 0.35%. The second component will enjoy a variable nature and will be 
determined as is established in section V.3.3. of this Prospectus. 
Swap: The Fondo will agree a swap contract with HSBC through which both will exchange, 
in a single net payment, the difference between (i) interest collected from the mortgage loans, 
calculated at their respective interest rate and (ii) interest collected from the same mortgage 
loans, calculated at an interest rate equal to the weighted average rate of the Bonds plus a 
margin of 0.40%. 
Reinvestment of the Flows: income of the Fondo (principal and interest from the loan 
portfolio) is reinvested at an interest rate equal to the reference interest rate of the Bonds. 
Commissions: Commission of the Sociedad Gestora. On each Payment Date, a commission 
of ¼ of 0.02% of the Outstanding Nominal Balance of the Mortgage Share Certificates at the 
beginning of the corresponding Transfer Period. The remaining ordinary expenses of the 
Fondo have been estimated. 
V.1.2. 
Numerical Scheme for the flow of income and expenses of the Fondo 
IMPORTANT NOTE FOR THE INVESTOR 
The information in the following tables is provided for illustrative purposes only, and does not 
represent the specific payment obligations to third parties by the Fondo, on the dates and periods to 
which they refer. Data have been elaborated under assumptions which consider defaults and 
prepayments of the loans, and are subject to change, as a consequence, any investor interested in the 
expected calendar of payments of the Fondo on each specific date must request the appropriate

V.3.  Other financial operations and credit enhancements 
V.3.1. Subordinated Loan for First Period Interest

Contract, a Subordinated Loan to the Fondo for a total amount of 900,000.00. 


 CHAPTER V – Financial Information of the Fondo 
79 
The amount of the Subordinated Loan will be forwarded 2 business days prior to the first 
Payment Date to the Fondo’s Account opened at the Paying Agent in the name of the Fondo. 
This amount will be used by the Sociedad Gestora to cover the difference, on the first 
Payment Date, between the accrual and collection of interest from the Mortgage Share 
Certificates.  
The Loan will accrue a variable interest rate equal to the Reference Interest Rate of the Bonds 
current at each moment plus a margin of 0.25%. Payment of said interest will be subject to 
the priority described in section V.4.2..  
The final maturity of the Loan will take place on the date of the liquidation of the Fondo. 
Nevertheless, the amortization of the Loan on each Payment Date will be free until its 
amortization, calculated by the Sociedad Gestora in accordance with the estimated need for 
resources to cover the balance between the accrual and collection of the Mortgage Share 
Certificates by the Fondo. On the first Payment Date, the Subordinated Loan will be 
amortized in an amount such that the Outstanding Nominal Balance of the Subordinated Loan 
is equal to the effective amount of the unbalance between the accrual and collection of 
interest from the Mortgage Share Certificates.  
The entirety of the amounts to be paid to the Issuer for both interest accrued and amortization 
of principal accrued by the Loan, will be subject to the priority order established in section 
V.4.2. and, in consequence, will only be paid to the Issuer on any specific Payment Date, in 
the event that the Available Resources on such Payment Date are sufficient to attend the 
obligations of the Fondo listed in sections (i) through (xv) of said section in relation to 
interests and (i) through (xviii) for the principal.  
All amounts, which, with respect to the above sections, are not paid to the creditor, will be 
effected on the following Payment Dates in which the Available Resources allow for such a 
payment in accordance with the established priority order. 
Those amounts owed to the creditor and not paid in respect to what is established in the 
aforementioned sections, will not accrue penalty interests in its favor. 
V.3.2. Initial Expenses Subordinated Loan 
Banco Pastor will grant, in accordance with the Initial Expenses Subordinated Loan 
Contract, a Subordinated Loan to the Fondo for a total amount of 895,103.93 Euros. 
The amount of the Initial Expenses Loan will be forwarded on the Closing Date to the 
Fondo’s Account opened at the Paying Agent. 
The amount will be used by the Sociedad Gestora to pay the initial expenses of the Fondo. 
The Loan will accrue a variable interest rate equal to the Reference Interest Rate of the Bonds 
current at each moment plus a margin of 0.30%. Payment of said interest will be subject to 
the priority order described in section V.4.2..  
The amortization of the Loan will be made in 20 equal and consecutive quotas, the first of 
which will take place on the first Payment Date (September 22nd, 2004) and the rest on the 


 CHAPTER V – Financial Information of the Fondo 
80 
following Payment Dates, all in accordance with the priority order described in section V.4.2. 
of this Prospectus. 
The entirety of the amounts to be paid to the Issuer, on account of both interest accrued and 
amortization of principal accrued by the Initial Expenses Loan, will be subject to the priority 
order of payments described in section V.4.2. and, in consequence, will only be paid to the 
Issuer on any specific Payment Date, in the event that the Available Resources on such 
Payment Date are sufficient to attend the obligations of the Fondo listed in sections (i) 
through (xvi) of said section in relation to interests and (i) through (xix) for the principal.  
All amounts, which, with respect to the above sections, are not paid to the creditor, will be 
effected on the following Payment Dates in which the Available Resources allow for such a 
payment in accordance with the established priority order. 
Those amounts owed to the creditor and not paid in respect to what is established in the 
aforementioned sections, will not accrue penalty interests in its favor. 
V.3.3. Participative Loan 
Banco Pastor will grant to the Fondo, as is established in the Participative Loan Contract, a 
subordinated loan to the Fondo destined by the Sociedad Gestora to the initial establishment 
of the Reserve Fondo. The total amount of the Participative Loan will be 9,000,000 Euros. 
On the Closing Date the creditor will transfer the corresponding amount of the Participative 
Loan to the Reinvestment Account opened in the name of the Issuer. 
Amortization of the Participative Loan will be made on each Payment Date for an amount 
equal to the amount in which, on each Payment Date, the Minimum Level of the Reserve 
Fondo is reduced, all in accordance with the priority of payments established in section 
V.4.2..  
Due to the subordinated nature of the Participative Loan, in relation to the rest of the Fondo’s 
obligations, and that its reimbursement depends on the performance of the Mortgage Share 
Certificates, and the evolution of the interest rates paid to the Bonds issued, the remuneration 
of the Participative Loan will have two components, one known and another one variable and 
related to the evolution of the risks of the Fondo: 
(i) “Fixed Remuneration of Participative Loan”: the Outstanding Nominal Balance of the 
Participative Loan will accrue interests calculated on the base of a variable interest rate equal 
to the reference interest rate of the Bond current at each moment, in accordance with section 
II.10. of this Prospectus plus a margin of 0.35%. 
(ii) “Variable Remuneration of Participative Loan”, will be equal to the positive difference 
between the interests and other amounts received from the Mortgage Share Certificates grouped 
in the Fondo and the expenses related with them. 
V.3.4. Reserve Fondo 
As credit enhancement to cover losses due to unpaid and/or defaulted Mortgage Loans, and in 
order to allow the payments to be made by the Fondo, in accordance with the priority order 
established in section V.4.2. of this Prospectus, a Reserve Fondo will be established. 


 CHAPTER V – Financial Information of the Fondo 
81 
The Reserve Fondo will be constituted initially on the Closing Date, funded by the 
Participative Loan, for an amount of 9,000,000 Euros. 
On each Payment Date, the Reserve Fondo will be founded, in its case, until the Minimum 
Level of the Reserve Fondo is reached, with the resources that, on each Payment Date, are 
available to such effect, in accordance with the priority order described in section V.4.2.. 
The Minimum Level of the Reserve Fondo will be the lesser of the following amounts: 
- 0.9% of the sum of the initial amount of the issue of Bonds. 
- 1.8% of the sum of the Outstanding Nominal Balance of the issue of the Bonds. 
No reduction of the Reserve Fondo will be made when one of the following situations takes 
place: 
(i) 
If the provision of the Reserve Fondo is not sufficient to reach the Minimum Level of the 
Reserve Fondo established for that Payment Date. 
(ii) 
The Outstanding Nominal Balance of the Non Defaulted Mortgage Share Certificates in 
arreas equal or above 90 days is higher than 1% of the Outstanding Nominal Balance of the 
Mortgage Share Certificates which have not defaulted. 
The Minimum Level of the Reserve Fondo will not be reduced before the Payment Date 
corresponding to June 22, 2007. Additionally, the Minimum Level of the Reserve Fondo will 
not fall below 0.5% of the initial balance of the Bond issue. 
The amounts of the Reserve Fondo will be deposited at the Reinvestment Account with the 
guarantees described in section V.3.5. of this Prospectus.   
V.3.5. Deposit of the resources of the Fondo 
V.3.5.1. Reinvestment Account 
The Fondo will have at the Issuer, in accordance with the Reinvestment Account 
Contract, an account (hereon, Reinvestment Account) through which on each Transfer 
Date, all the amounts due to the Fondo from the mortgage loans from the Issuer will be 
received.  
The Issuer will undertake, on behalf of the Fondo, the services of management and 
maintenance of the aforesaid account, in accordance with regular banking practice. 
Expenses generated from the maintenance of said account will be assigned to the entity 
hosting the account, except when the expenses are generated by the negligence of the 
Sociedad Gestora. 
The Sociedad Gestora will make all the necessary instructions to effect the payments 
from the Reinvestment Account, necessary to attend the obligations of the Fondo 
through the Paying Agent through the Fondo’s Account. 
 


 CHAPTER V – Financial Information of the Fondo 
82 
Positive balances at the Reinvestment Accounts, will accrue an annual variable interest 
rate in favor of the Fondo, equal to the Reference Interest Rate of the Bonds as defined 
in the Reinvestment Account Contract. 
The balances of the Reinvestment Account will be maintained in cash. 
During the life of the Fondo, the balance of the Reinvestment Account will not exceed at 
any given moment 4% of the Outstanding Nominal Balance of the Bonds. Any amount 
exceeding said calculation will be immediately transferred to the Fondo’s Account. In 
the event that the short term rating granted by S&P to the Issuer is equal or above A-1, 
said transfer will not take place until that level of rating is maintained. 
Currently, the Issuer has a short term risk of P1 and a long term risk of A2 from 
Moody’s, and a short term risk of A-2 from S&P. In the event that the rating granted by 
the Rating Agencies is downgraded to a short term risk below P1 or long term risk 
below A3, from Moody’s, or A-2 for short term risk from S&P, the Sociedad Gestora, 
on behalf of the Fondo, will transfer all the amounts deposited at the Reinvestment 
Account to the Fondo’s Account. Equally, and from that moment, the Issuer will transfer 
all the amounts that, as Loan Servicer, and in accordance with this Prospectus, it obtains 
in the future. The transfer will take place on the same day the amount is received, in 
accordance with section IV.1.2. of this Prospectus. Nevertheless, if the Issuer presents a 
banking endorsement, sufficient in the opinion of the Sociedad Gestora, from a credit 
entity with a rating at least equal to P1 for Moody’s, and A-1 for S&P, or other accepted 
by the Rating Agencies, guaranteeing the total availability of the amounts deposited in 
the Reinvestment Account, the Issuer will be able to maintain the Reinvestment 
Account. 
V.3.5.2. Fondo’s Account 
The Fondo will, in accordance with the Paying Agent Contract, hold an account in its 
name at the Paying Agent. 
The Issuer will transfer to the Fondo’s Account, value the 2 business days immediately 
prior to each Payment Date, all amounts deposited in the Reinvestment Account, and 
which are necessary for the payment corresponding to such Date. 
Following instructions by the Sociedad Gestora, all necessary payments to satisfy the 
obligations of the Fondo will be made through the Fondo’s Account. 
The Fondo’s Account will not have a negative balance against the Fondo. All balances 
of the Fondo’s Account will be maintained in cash. 
Amounts deposited in the Fondo’s Account will accrue interest in favor of the Fondo, 
based on the variable interest rate resulting from reducing the EURIBOR by a margin of 
0.15%. The EURIBOR and the calculation method for the interest accrued by the 
Fondo’s Account will be determined in the Financial Agency and Fund´s Account 
Contract. 
At the time of the establishment of the Fondo Regulations and the registration of this 
Prospectus, the Paying Agent has a maximum rating for short term risk granted by the 
Rating Agencies. 


 CHAPTER V – Financial Information of the Fondo 
83 
In the event that the rating of the Paying Agent, given by the Rating Agencies for short 
term risk, is reduced below P1, for Moody’s, or A-1 for S&P, the Sociedad Gestora will, 
prior consultation with the Rating Agencies, take one of the following decisions within 
the 30 days following said downgrading to maintain an adequate level of guarantee in 
respect of the compromises derived from the maintenance of the Fondo’s Account: 
1. Obtain from a credit entity with rating for short term risk no less than P1, granted by 
Moody’s, or A-1 by S&P, or other recognized by the Rating Agencies, a guarantee 
regarding the compromises assumed by the Paying Agent. 
2. Replace the Paying Agent for another credit entity with a rating no less than P1, 
granted by Moody’s or A-1 by S&P, or other recognized by the Rating Agencies, that 
will assume, under the same conditions, the functions of the Paying Agent. 
V.3.6. Technical Advance 
Taking into account that some of the delays in the payments made by the borrowers have an 
interim or technical character, and with the purpose of avoiding that such delays negatively 
affect the flow of payments to the Bondholders, and taking into account that there is a lapse 
of 20 days between the end of the Transfer Period and the Transfer Date on behalf of the 
Fondo, and that the Issuer collects the amounts during said period, as Loan Servicer, which 
belong to the Fondo, the Sociedad Gestora, on behalf of the Fondo, will be entitled to receive 
on every Transfer Date an advance on account of such amounts.  
The amount of the Technical Advance cannot exceed the amount collected by the Issuer, 
from the Loans it administers, for any concept related to the Fondo in relation to the 
Mortgage Share Certificates, from the end of the last Transfer Period until the Transfer Date 
on which the Technical Advance is requested. 
The Sociedad Gestora will calculate the Technical Advance as an amount equal to the sum of 
the matured amounts and not yet collected by the Issuer. During the previous Transfer Period, 
for principal and interest from the Mortgage Share Certificates in arrears on the Transfer Date 
on which the Technical Advance is requested, taking into account the limitations described in 
the previous paragraph. The Technical Advance will not be superior, in respect of each 
Mortgage Loan, to the interests and principal on the last quota. 
On each Calculation Date, the Technical Advance delivered on the previous Transfer Date 
may be deducted from the amounts to be transferred, and a new Technical Advance 
corresponding to the following payment may be requested. 
V.3.7. Swap Contract 
The Sociedad Gestora, in representation and on behalf of the Fondo, will settle with HSBC 
a Interest Swap Contract described as follows. 
Part A: Sociedad Gestora, in representation and on behalf of the Fondo. 
Part B: HSBC 
 


 CHAPTER V – Financial Information of the Fondo 
84 
V.3.7.1. Liquidation Dates 
Liquidation Dates will be the Transfer Dates corresponding to the months of March, June, 
September and December of each year or the following Business Day. 
V.3.7.2. Liquidation Periods and Liquidation Period Calculation Periods 
Liquidation Periods shall be the days elapsed between two consecutive Liquidation Dates, 
including the first and excluding the last. Exceptionally, the first liquidation period will 
have a duration equivalent to the days elapsed from the Closing Date (included) and 
September 20, 2004 (excluded). 
The Period for the Calculation of each Liquidation Period shall be the days elapsed during 
the 3 months existing between the first day of the month in which the Liquidation Period 
begins and the last day of the month immediately prior to the month in which the current 
Liquidation Period ends, both included. Exceptionally, the Calculation Period for the First 
Liquidation Period will extend from the Closing Date until August 31, 2004, both included, 
and the last will extend from the first day of the month corresponding to the Payment Date 
in which the Fondo is liquidated and said Payment Date, both included. 
V.3.7.3. Amounts to be paid by Part A 
On each Liquidation Date, Part A will pay the Amount to be Paid by Part A, which will be 
equal to the interest payments of each and every one of the loans which have effectively 
paid interest during said Calculation Period. 
V.3.7.4. Amounts to be paid by Part B 
On each Liquidation Period, Part B will pay the Amount to be Paid by Part B, equal to the 
result of the new calculation, for the current Calculation Period of the Liquidation Period, 
interest payments from each and everyone of the loans which have paid interest during said 
Calculation Period. This new calculation will use an interest rate equal to the Part B Interest 
Rate. Part B Interest Rate shall be equal to the Weighed Average Interest Rate of the Bonds 
plus a margin of 0.40%. As there is a Bond Payment Date during each Calculation Period, 
for each Calculation Period two Weighed Average Interest Rates of the Bonds will be 
calculated and, therefore, two Part B Interest Rates. Each one will be applied to the number 
of days corresponding to each of the two Interest Accrual Periods of the current Calculation 
Period. For the First Calculation Period, a single Part B Interest Rate will be calculated, 
using the Weighed Average Interest Rate of the Bonds existing on the Closing Date, plus 
0.40%. 
V.3.7.5. Balance Liquidations 
The Amounts to be paid on a Liquidation Date will be liquidated in accordance with the 
Swap Contract, in such a way that, if two parts must pay each other, the Part with the 
highest amount will make a payment for the excess amount. 
V.3.7.6. Swap Contract breaches  
If on a Liquidation Date, the Fondo does not pay the amount due to Part B, the Swap 
Contract may be terminated by request from Part B. In the event that there is a liquidation 
payment to be made, the Fondo will assume, if applicable, such payment established in the 


 CHAPTER V – Financial Information of the Fondo 
85 
Swap Contract, always in accordance with the Priority Order of Payments. Without 
prejudice to the above, except in a situation of permanent financial unbalance of the Fondo, 
the Sociedad Gestora, on behalf of the Fondo, will try an arrange another financial swap 
contract. 
If on a Payment Date Part B does not pay the amounts due to the Fondo, the Sociedad 
Gestora may terminate the Swap Contract. In this case, Part B will assume the payment 
obligation of the liquidation amount established in the Contract.  
The liquidation amount will be calculated by the Sociedad Gestora, as Swap calculation 
agent, taking into account the market value for Financial Interest Swap Contracts.  
V.3.7.7. Special situations for Part B 
In the event that Banco Pastor obtains a rating for its senior debt on the Moody’s long term 
scale equal or above A1 and a rating for short term risk from S&P equal or above A-1, 
Banco Pastor may subrogate the position of HSBC as Part B of the Swap Contract. 
Additionally, this section regulates the situation in which Part B, losses a qualified rating 
sufficient to be considered a Swap counter party, that is, a long term rating from Moody’s 
equal or above A1 and a short term risk from S&P equal or above A-1. 
If the event described in the previous paragraph takes place, Part B, unless it negatively 
affects the Bond rating, will: 
1. In a term of 30 Business Days following the notification of the event, (i) constitute a 
deposit in favor of the Fondo in an amount to satisfy the requirements of the Rating 
Agencies, in an account opened at a credit entity with a rating for non-subordinated 
debt for short and long term risk by Moody’s, of P1 and A2, respectively, and a rating 
no lower than A-1 by S&P for short term risk, and at the same time Part B maintains its 
short term risk rating of P1, and equal or above A-3 for long term risk (from Moody’s), 
and equal or above A-3 (from S&P); or (ii) obtain a guarantee, in favor of the Fondo, to 
satisfy the requirements of the Rating Agencies, from an entity with a short term risk 
for non-subordinated debt equal to A-1, or equivalent rating from S&P, and P1 for short 
term and A1 for long term, or equivalent rating from Moody's; or 
2. Move to find another entity, with a rating for non-subordinated short term risk of A-1, 
or equivalent rating from S&P, and P1 or equivalent rating for Moody’s, and A1, for 
non-subordinated long term risk or equivalent rating for Moody’s, which will undertake 
its contractual position and substitute it; in accordance with the terms and conditions 
established by the Sociedad Gestora and the Rating Agencies to maintain the ratings 
assigned to the Bonds issued by the Fondo. 
All costs, expenses and taxes derived from the breach of the above obligations will be paid 
by Part B. 
V.3.7.8. Contract Maturity 
The Swap Contract will be legally terminated in the event that the Rating Agencies fail to 
confirm, prior to the beginning of the Subscription Period, as final, the ratings assigned to 
each Bond. 


 CHAPTER V – Financial Information of the Fondo 
86 
The early cancellation of the Swap Contract will not constitute a motive to force the early 
maturity or liquidation of the Fondo, except in conjunction with other events or 
circumstances related to the assets of the Fondo, a substantial or permanent alteration of the 
financial balance of the Fondo occurs. 
The maturity of the Swap Contract will take place on the date of the liquidation of the

 CHAPTER VII – Market Considerations 
93 
CHAPTER VII 
MARKET CONSIDERATIONS 
VII.1.  Recent and Significant Mortgage Market Trends in General and, in Particular, of 
the Mortgage Loan Market and the Securitization Bonds.  
In recent years the Spanish Mortgage Market has been affected by a growth process in respect of 
volume and increased competition among the credit entities which operate in it. 
There are two events that affect the evolution of the Spanish Mortgage Market. On the one hand, 
the new legislation emerging from the Ministerial Order of May 5, 1994, regarding the 
transparency of the financial conditions of the mortgage loans, and its subsequent development 
by the Bank of Spain Circular 5/94 of July 22. These regulations have helped to consolidate the 
homogeneity of mortgage loans, not only from the legal point of view, but also from the 
economic perspective which implies the use of defined reference rates for variable rate loans, 
recommended by the monetary authorities. In this sense, the substitution of purely monetary 
rates were easily substituted by others with a more statistical nature, like 1-year MIBOR (its 
calculation method modified by Ministerial Order December 1 1999) or, since July 1999, the 1-
year Interbanking Reference (Bank of Spain Circular 7/99 July 29), clarifying possible 
distortions derived from a institutional market. Additionally, other reference rates obtained 
directly from the Market have been recommended and introduced, more representative of price 
evolutions. Finally, a reference was introduced with a significance and reach closer to long term, 
characterizing mortgage loan transactions: secondary market Internal Yield Rate of Public Debt 
for 2-6 years, with a completely residual usage. 
Secondly, the evolution of interest rates has produced a significant move of credit entities’ 
mortgage loan portfolios from fixed to variable rates, favored by the final assumption of the end 
consumer of the tools offered by Law 2/94 of March 30th, regarding subrogation and 
modification of the mortgage loans.  
VII.2.  Implications Derived from those Trends Mentioned in the Previous Section. 
The total amount of Mortgage Loans participated by the Mortgage Share Certificates grouped in 
IM PASTOR 2 carries a variable interest rate; some of which will accrue, during a transition 
period, at a fixed rate, adjusting periodically to the variations in the interest rates of the market. 
Therefore, it is not probable that important modifications in the Prepayment Rates of the 
portfolio will occur due to changes in the interest rate levels.  
Notwithstanding the above, the average term and the duration of the issue of some Bonds in this 
Prospectus could be modified in relation to those initially estimated in section II.11. in the event 
that the Rate of Prepayment of the Shares varies. 
It is the opinion of this Sociedad Gestora that there is no historical public information at the 
moment regarding prepayment amortization to be able to elaborate predictions in both mid and 
long term on the behavior of the Prepayment Amortization Rates of the mortgage portfolios. In 
this sense, it must be taken into account that the market, as indicated in the above section, has 
experienced a profound modification in recent years, and this does not recommend the 
elaboration of predictions based on the extrapolation of available data in the last years, the data

being both scarce and limited in time, and impossible to assign them any representative value. In 
any event, those investors interested can consult the information that this and other Sociedades 
Gestoras publish regularly on the Mortgage Backed Securities Funds.
