RISK FACTORS 
1. RISKS ARISING FROM THE LEGAL STATUS AND BUSINESS OF THE ISSUER 
1.1 Nature of the Fund and obligations of the Sociedad Gestora  
The Fund constitutes a separate capital without legal form which is managed by a 
Sociedad Gestora (Management Company), pursuant to the provisions of Royal Decree 
926/1998. The Fund will only honour its financial liabilities to its creditors with its 
capital. 
The Sociedad Gestora will perform for and on behalf of the Fund, all those duties 
required of it under Royal Decree 926/1998, in addition to defending the interests of the 
Bondholders, as manager of third-party funds without there existing a bondholders 
syndicate. The  capacity to defend the Bondholders’ interests will therefore depend on the 
resources of the Sociedad Gestora. 
1.2 Insolvency of the Sociedad Gestora 
In accordance with article 19 of Royal Decree 926/1998, in the event of the Sociedad 
Gestora being declared bankrupt, and without prejudice to the effects of that situation of 
bankruptcy described above, a Sociedad Gestora will be found to substitute it.  Provided 
that in this case, four months have elapsed since the event determining the substitution 
took place and no new Sociedad Gestora has been found to take charge of managing the 
Fund,  the Fund will be liquidated and the securities issued and charged to it redeemed, 
pursuant to the provisions of the Deed of Constitution of the Fund and in this Prospectus.        
1.3 Insolvency of the Sociedad Gestora, Seller and other entities. 
The insolvency of any of the parties intervening (CAM, the Sociedad Gestora or any 
other Fund counterparty entity) could affect its contractual relations with the Fund, in 
accordance with the provisions of Act 22/2003 of July 9, (Ley Concursal). 
In this respect, in the event of insolvency of the Sociedad Gestora, it will be substituted 
by another Sociedad Gestora pursuant to the provisions of the preceding section of this 
Prospectus.  In the event of the Sociedad Gestora being declarked insolvent, the assets  
belonging to the Fund in possession of the Sociedad Gestora over which the latter has no 
right of use, guarantee or retention (except for the funds due to their fungible nature) 
existing in the asset base, they will be considered as belonging to the Fund and will be 
handed over by the receivers to the Fund at the request of the Sociedad Gestora .  The 
structure of the bonds securitisation transaction contemplated does not allow for any sums 
in cash to exist that could be incorporated into the Sociedad Gestora’s asset base, except 
in the event of breach of contract by the parties, since according to the provisions of the 
Deed of Constitution and the Prospectus, the amounts pertaining to the Fund must be 
deposited in the accounts opened in the name of the Fund by the Sociedad Gestora, 


This prospectus is a translation into English of the original "Folleto" drafted in Spanish language and registered with the 
"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores" (the Spanish Securities Market Commission, "CNMV") on October 4, 2005. The 
"Folleto" drafted in the Spanish language is the only official document, and no document other than the "Folleto" shall have any 
legal effect or be relied upon with regard to the Note Issue.

(which intervenes in opening these accounts, not as an employee of the Fund, but as its 
legal representative, for which reason  the Fund will be able to exercise the right of 
absolute separation, as provided for in articles 80 and 81 of the Ley Concursal).  
In the event of CAM being declared insolvent, the issue and assigning of the Mortgage 
Shares and Mortgage Transfer Certificates may only be withdrawn in the case of 
exercising the action of withdrawal, demonstrating the existence of fraud in that issue and 
assignment, in accordance with the provisions of Additional Provision Five, in paragraph 
4 of Act 3/1994 of April 14. 
In the event that the CAM is declared insolvent pursuant to Ley Concursal  22/2003, of 
July 9, the Fund, acting through the Sociedad Gestora, will have the right of separation 
over the multiple securities representing the Mortgage Shares and Mortgage Transfer 
Certificates under the terms provided for in articles 80 and 81 of the Ley Concursal. In 
addition, the Fund, acting through its Sociedad Gestora, will have the right to obtain  
from CAM the amounts resulting from the Mortgage Shares and Mortgage Transfer 
Certificates, since these amounts will be considered as belonging to the Fund, through its  
Sociedad Gestora, and consequently, they will be transferred to the Sociedad Gestora in 
representation of the Fund. Notwithstanding this, it should not be ruled out that that it 
might not be possible to exercise that right of separation in respect of the funds managed 
by CAM, for account and order of the Fund, during the course of its fund-collecting ruties 
with respect to the Mortgage Loans and the funds deposited in the Fund account opened 
in CAM, in both cases, on the date of the declaration of insolvency, due to their fungible 
nature and the ensuing confusion with respect to the assets. The mechanisms for 
attenuating the aforementioned risk are set forth in paragraphs 3.4.4.1. (Guaranteed 
Interest Rate Deposit Agreement, Reinvestment Account), 3.4.5. (How the payments 
relating to the assets are received) and 3.7.1. (Administration and Custody of the  
Mortgage Loans) of the Additional Module. 
1.4 Restricted actions against the Sociedad Gestora. 
Bondholders and other ordinary creditors of the Fund will have no legal recourse against 
the Sociedad Gestora, other than based on non-performance of its functions or failure to 
comply with the articles set forth in the Deed of Constitution and the present Prospectus.   
2. 
RISKS ARISING FROM THE SECURITIES 
2.1. 
Liquidity. 
There is no guarantee that a minimum frequency or volume of Bond transactions will result 
in the market. 
There is no commitment stating that any entity will intervene in secondary contraction, 
rendering the Bonds liquid in exchange for compensation of any kind.  
Furthermore, under no circumstances may the Fund repurchase the Bonds from their 
holders, although they may be redeemed in advance in their entirety in the event of the 
Early Liquidation of the Fund under the terms and in the cases set forth in section 4.4. of 
the Registration Document. 


This prospectus is a translation into English of the original "Folleto" drafted in Spanish language and registered with the 
"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores" (the Spanish Securities Market Commission, "CNMV") on October 4, 2005. The 
"Folleto" drafted in the Spanish language is the only official document, and no document other than the "Folleto" shall have any 
legal effect or be relied upon with regard to the Note Issue. 
 
8
 
2.2. 
Yield of the Bonds. 
Calculation of the Internal Return Rate  (IRR) for Bondholders as provided for under 
section 4.10 of the Assets Note is subject to the future market interest rates, given the  
variable nature of the nominal interest rate of the Bonds in each Series. 
 
2.3. 
Term of the Bonds. 
Calculation of the average life and term of the Bonds in each Series included in section 
4.10 of the Assets Note is influenced by a series of geographical, economic and social 
factors such as the age of the debtors, seasonal factors, market interest rates and the 
unemployment rate, which make them impossible to predict. 
2.4.  Delinquency interest. 
Under no circumstances will the delay of interest payments or repayment of principal to the 
Bondholders give rise to accrual of delinquency interest in their favour.  
3. 
RISKS ARISING FROM THE ASSETS BACKING THE ISSUE 
3.1 Risk of default on the Mortgage Loans. 
Holders of the bonds issued by the Fund will be exposed to the risk of default on the 
Mortgage Loans pooled in the Fund, by the issue of the Shares and Certificates, taking into 
consideration the protection afforded by the credit enhancement mechanisms. 
The Seller assumes no liability for the non-payment by the debtors of principal, interest or 
any other amounts that may be owed by such debtors, by virtue of the Mortgage Loans.  In 
accordance with article 348 of the Commercial Code, it is liable to the Fund only for the 
existence and legitimacy of the Mortgage Loans and the personality with which it performs  
the sale. Neither will it assume any other responsibility for guaranteeing, either directly or 
indirectly, the successful outcome of the transaction, nor will it grant guarantees or 
endorsements, or enter into repurchase agreements relating to the Shares and Certificates. 
All the above shall be without prejudice to the responsibilities of the Seller in relation to 
the substitution of any Shares and/or Certificates which fail to comply with the  
representations contained in section, 2.2.8. of the Additional Module in relation to the 
commitments established in sections 2.2.9 and 3.7.1. of the Additional Module. 
The Bonds issued by the Fund do not represent or constitute an obligation on the part of 
CAM or the Sociedad Gestora.  No other guarantees exist granted by any public or private 
entities, including CAM, the Sociedad Gestora and any affiliate company or  company in 
which either of the above hold shares.    
3.1. 
Limited protection. 


This prospectus is a translation into English of the original "Folleto" drafted in Spanish language and registered with the 
"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores" (the Spanish Securities Market Commission, "CNMV") on October 4, 2005. The 
"Folleto" drafted in the Spanish language is the only official document, and no document other than the "Folleto" shall have any 
legal effect or be relied upon with regard to the Note Issue. 
 
9
An investment in the Bonds may be affected, among other things, by a worsening of the 
general economic conditions that have a negative repercussion on the repayment of the 
Mortgage Loans backing the Issue of the Fund. In the event of the  non-payments of the 
Mortgage Loans reaching a high level, this could lead to a reduction or even the exhaustion 
of the limited protection against losses in the portfolio of Mortgage Loans benefiting the  
Bonds as a result of the existence of the credit enhancement transactions enumerated in 
section 3.4.2. of the Additional Module. 
3.2. 
Risk of prepayment of the Mortgage Loans. 
The Mortgage Shares and Certificates pooled in the Fund will be subject to early 
redemption when the Debtors repay early the outstanding principal for the Mortgage 
Loans, in the event of CAM being subrogated in the corresponding Mortgage Loans by 
another bank qualified for that purpose, subject to Act 2/1994 of March 30 on the 
subrogation and modification of mortgage loans, in its valid text ( “Act 2/1994”) or  by 
virtue of any other cause that could produce the same effect.  
The risk of such prepayment will be passed on quarterly, on each Payment Date, to the 
Bondholders, through the partial repayment of such Loans, pursuant to the repayment 
regulations set forth in section 4.9. of the Asset Document.

2.2. Accounting principles used by the Fund 
The Fund will carry out the crediting and charging of income and expenses based on the 
accrual principle. 
a) Shares and Certificates subscribed by the Fund: the Shares and Certificates are 
registered in the Funds assets for an amount equal to their face value, coinciding with 
their acquisition value. 
Interest on the Shares and Certificates are recorded in the profit and loss account, in 
keeping with the principle of accrual. 
Unpaid interest accrued on the Shares and Certificates not declared to be in Default are 
recorded as an asset in the balance sheet. 
Interest due and principal outstanding on the Shares and Certificates declared as being in 
Default are recorded as assets, except in those cases where it can be demonstrated that the 
mortgaged property is insufficient as a guarantee. 
b) Bonds issued: The Bonds are recorded as a liability in the Fund balance sheet for the 
same amount as their disbursed value.  
Interest payable by virtue of the Bonds is recorded in the profit and loss account on an 
accrued basis, and that portion of such interest that is accrued, in accordance with  the  
principle of accrual  which is owed but remains unpaid is recorded in the related liabilities 
account. 
c) Treasury Account and Reinvestment Account: Cash accounts of the Fund maintained 
by the Payments Agent and Seller respectively, with pre-established reinvestment 
mechanisms. 
The amount of the accounts will be entered as a Fund asset, whereas income and 
expenses for these accounts form part of the Fund’s income and expenses. 
d) Operating expenses, fees and salaries: All fees and expenses are deductible during the 
period they fall due.  Preliminary expenses for the Fund and the issue of the Bonds 
described in section 6 of the Assets Note will be repaid on a lineal basis during a term of 
twenty consecutive Payment Dates, starting on January 26, 2006.  
e) Technical advances: On each Collection Date for Technical Advances obtained on the 
previous Collection Date, this is considered deductible in the settlement of the Collection 
Period for which settlement is made, and a New Technical Advance can be requested, 
that is charged to the following settlement. 
f) Initial Expenses Loan, Subordinated Loan and Participative Loan: The interest on the 
Initial Expenses Loan, Subordinated Loan and Participative Loan will be booked during 
each period in keeping with the accrual principle.

4.6 
   Tax Regime of the Fund. 
There follows a brief summary of the general tax regulations applicable to the Fund.  It 
must be understood without prejudice to the peculiarities of each local jurisdiction and 
of the regulations that may apply at the time of obtaining or declaring the relevant 
income. 
The tax regime applicable to Asset Securitisation Funds is comprised of the general 
provisions container in Legislative Royal Decree 4/2004, of March 5 2004, approving the 
consolidated text of the Spanish Corporation Tax and its implementing provisions, with the 
specific peculiarities arising from the provisions of Act 19/1992, of July 7, 1992, regulating 
Real Estate Investment Funds and Mortgage Backed Securitisation Funds, in Act 3/1994 of 
April 14 1994 and Royal Decree 926/1998, of May 14 1998, regulating asset securitisation 
funds and managing companies of securitisation funds which, in summary, define the 
following fundamental principles: 
1) 
Asset Securitisation Funds are entities liable for Corporation Tax, subject to the 
general rules for determining the tax base, and to the general rate of 35 per cent, 
and to the common rules for deductions, set-off of losses and other substantive 
elements of the tax. 
2) 
Investment income of securitisation funds is subject to the general rules on 
withholdings on account of the Corporate Income Tax, with the particularity 
that article 57-k of the Regulations approved by Royal Decree 1777/2004 of 30 
July 2004 provides that withholding does not apply to “income from mortgage 
participating units, mortgage loans and other credit rights that constitute 
revenue items for the securitisation funds". Consequently, in addition to the 
income from the Mortgage Transfer Certificates which are the direct object of 
the securitisation, the withholding exemption also extends, according to the 
expressly stated policy of the tax administration, to the income of the Mortgage 
Loans, to the extent that they form part of the ordinary business activity of the 
said funds. 
3) 
Article 5.10 of Act 19/1992 provides that the formation of mortgage 
securitisation funds is exempt from classification as “corporate operations”, in 
the Stamp Duty and Transfer Taxes and thereby predetermining its submission 
to the same. 
The transfer to the Fund of the Mortgage Transfer Certificates provided for in the 
Deed in the manner described above is a transaction that is subject to but qualifies 
for an exemption from the Value Added Tax in accordance with the provisions of 
article 20.One.18th-e of Act 37/1992 of 28 December 1992. 
The establishment and assignment of guarantees is subject to the general tax 
regime with no exceptions.

done upwards, plus  (ii) the spread applicable to each Bond Series as shown below. 
 
Reference Interest Rate: The Reference Interest Rate for fixing the interest rate applicable 
to both Bond Series  will be the EURIBOR three (3) month rate or, if necessary, the 
substitute rate, determined as shown below.  
Fixing of the Reference Interest Rate for the Bonds: Fixing of the EURIBOR will be 
done in keeping with the rules described in this section. 
On each of the Interest Fixing Dates, Sociedad Gestora will fix the Reference Interest Rate 
which will be equivalent to the EURIBOR, determined as:  
(i) 
The three-month EURIBOR rate supplied by REUTERS’ EURIBOR = 
page, at 11:00 a.m. (C.E.T. time) on the Interest Fixing Date. “ REUTERS 
Screen, EURIBOR= electronic page" which shows the content of the  
"EURIBOR=" electronic page on the REUTERS MONITOR MONEY 
RATES SERVICE (or any other page that could substitute such page). 
(ii) 
In the event of absence or inability to obtain the rate established in 
paragraph (i) above, the EURIBOR three-month rate shown on the 
“TELERATE” screen (TELERATE SPAIN, S.A.), on page 248 (or any 
other page that could substitute it) at 11:00 a.m. (C.E.T. time) on the 
Interest Fixing Date will apply.

(iii) 
In the event of absence or inability to obtain the rate established in 
paragraphs (i) and (ii) above, the simple arithmetic mean of the London 
rates for Interbank interest rates on non-transferable deposits in euros for a 
three months maturity term for an equivalent amount to the Nominal 
Balance pending Collection on the Bonds on the Interest Fixing Date by the 
following banks will apply, as near as possible to 11:00 a.m.  (CET time) 
and this interest rate will be requested simultaneously from such banks: 
 
- 
Banco Santander Central Hispano (London) 
- 
JP Morgan Chase & Co. (London) 
- 
Barclays Bank (London) 
- 
Confederación Española de Cajas de Ahorros (London Branch)

applying to the  simple arithmetical mean of the quoted rates, rates furnished 
by at least two of these institutions.  
(iv) 
In the event of absence or inability to obtain the of interest rates in 
accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (i), (ii), and (iii), the 
Reference Interest Rate for the Interest Accrual Period immediately before 
will apply. On the First Interest Fixing Date, in the event that the Reference 
Rate is not published in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (i), 
(ii) and (iii), in accordance with paragraph (i), the rate published will apply 
on the last Business Date on which such Reference Interest Rate was 
published. 
The Sociedad Gestora will keep a list of the contents of the REUTERS or TELERATE 
screens, or if applicable, the declarations of quotations from the banks referred to in 
paragraph (iii) above, as documents accrediting the EURIBOR rates determined. 
Date for Fixing the Reference Interest Rate and Bonds Interest Rate: The date for 
fixing the Reference Interest Rate for each Interest Accrual Period will be the 2nd  
Business Day prior to the corresponding Payment Date (hereinafter, “Interest Fixing 
Date”)  and will apply to the following Interest Accrual Period. For the first Interest 
Accrual Period, the Reference Interest Rate will be fixed on October 6  2005, prior to the 
start of the Subscription Period. 
Once the Reference Interest Rate for the Bonds has been fixed, on the same Interest 
Fixing Date, the Sociedad Gestora will calculate and determine the applicable interest rate 
for each of the Bonds Series for the following Interest Accrual Period. 
Spread to be applied to the Reference Interest rate for each of the Bond Series:

The spread applicable to the Reference Interest Rate fixed as specified above, for 
calculating the interest rate accrued by the Series A Bonds on each Interest Payment Date  
is between 0.08% and 0.16%, both inclusive.  
The spread applicable to the Reference Interest Rate fixed as specified above for 
calculating the interest rate accrued by the Series B Bonds on each Interest Payment Date 
is between 0.20% and 0.40%, both inclusive. 
The spread applicable to Series A and B Bonds, expressed as a percentage, will be 
determined by common accord by the Management Entities, by no later than 10:00 hours  
(CET) on October 6 2005. The final spread applicable to both Bond  Series will be 
notified by fax to the Sociedad Gestora, no later than 10:30 (CET) on  October 6  2005 by 
the Management Entities. In the event of the absence of this notification, the Sociedad 
Gestora will set the spread for those Series at 0.12% for the Series A Bonds and 0.33% 
for the Series B Bonds. Similarly, on that same date, the  Sociedad Gestora will also 
notify the CNMV as additional information to this Prospectus. The final spread applicable 
will be set down in the notarised disbursement record. 
Formula for calculating the Bond interest: Calculation of the interest accrued by the 
Bonds for both Series, during each Interest Accrual Period, will be made by the  Sociedad 
Gestora based on the following formula:

For the purpose of the present Bond Issue, ”Business Days” are considered to 
be all those days which are not: 
-Saturday, 
-Sunday, 
-bank holidays in the city of Madrid, or 
-non-business days on the Target (Trans European Automated Real-Time 
Gross Settlement Express Transfer System). 
In the event that on any Payment Date, despite the mechanisms established for protecting 
the rights of the Bondholders, the Available Resources of the Fund were to be insufficient 
to honour the interest payment obligations of the Fund, as provided for in section 3.4.6.2. 
of the Additional Module, the amount available for payment of interest will be distributed 
in accordance with the Priority of Payments Ranking established in that section and in the 
event of the Available Resources only being sufficient to partly cover obligations with the 
same ranking, the amount available will be distributed among the Bonds affected, in 
proportion to the Nominal Balance pending Collection of such Bonds and the amounts 
not collected by the Bondholders  will be paid on the next Payment Date possible, 
without accruing delinquency interest. Payments pending collection by the Bondholders 
will be made effective on the next Payment Date (if sufficient Available Resources exist 
to do so) whose ranking is immediately before payments made to Bondholders for the 
same series corresponding to that period. The Fund, through its Sociedad Gestora, may 
not defer payment of interest or principal on the Bonds any time after the Legal Maturity 
Date, which is October 26, 2043 or, if this day is a Non-Business Day, the next Business 
Day. 
 
Withholdings, payments on account, contributions and taxes already established 
or to be established in the future on principal, interest or return of the Bonds 
will be solely borne by the bondholders, and their amount will be deducted, as 
the case may be, by the corresponding entity, in the manner established by law. 
 
Payment will be made through the ICO using IBERCLEAR and its participative 
entities to distribute the amounts.

Maturity date and redemption of the securities 
4.9.1 
Redemption price 
The securities will be redeemed at par value, i.e. 100,000 euros per Bond. 
 
4.9.2 
Date and redemption types 
4.9.2.1 
Redemption of the Bonds. 
Redemption of Series A and B Bonds will be done pro rata between the Bonds 
of the same Series to be redeemed (in accordance with the following 
provisions), by reducing the nominal amount until completed, on each Payment 
Date, for an amount equal to the lesser of the following amounts: 
(a) The positive difference on that Payment Date, between the Nominal Balance 
pending Collection of the Bonds (prior to the redemption made on that Payment 
Date) and the Nominal Balance pending Maturity of non-Defaulted Shares and 
Certificates corresponding to the last day of the month prior to the Payment 
Date; and 
(b) The Available Resources on that Payment Date, after deducting the amounts 
corresponding to the items indicated in paragraphs (i) to (v) of section 3.4.6.2. of 
the Additional Module. 
Consequently the Defaulted Shares and Certificates (those in which there is a 
delay in payment equal to or greater than 12 months), will give rise to the 
redemption of the Bonds for an amount equal to their Nominal Balance pending 
Maturity on the last day of the calendar month prior to the Payment Date in 
progress, plus the amounts due and not collected since the previous Payment 
Date. For this redemption, the Available Fund Resources will be used, after first 
paying all those obligations preceding this obligation in the Priority of 
Payments Ranking described in section 3.4.6.2. of the Additional Module. In the 
event no Available Resources existing with which to make these payments, the 
pertinent amounts will remain pending redemption for the next Payments Date 
immediately after. 
In the event that the substitution of Shares and Certificates, as provided for in paragraph 
2.2.9. of the Additional Module, not being possible, the amounts derived from the early 
redemption by the Seller of the Mortgage Shares and /or Certificates affected will form 
part of the Available Resources for next Payment Date. 
The first partial redemption of the Series A Bonds will take place on the first Payment 
Date (January 26 2006).  Redemption of the Series B Bonds will only commence when 
the Series A Bonds have been fully redeemed.  The final redemption of the Series A and 
B Bonds will be on the Legal Maturity Date (October 26, 2043, or if this is not a Business 
Day, on the next Business Day), without prejudice to the partial redemptions foreseen 
which the Sociedad Gestora, for and on behalf of the Fund,  pursuant to the provisions of

Bond Issue prior to the Legal Maturity Date.     
4.9.2.2 
Calculation Dates, Collection Periods and Notification Dates. 
“Fund Collection Date” ,  on the 20th of the month. On these dates the transfers 
will be made from the Seller, as the Manager of its loans, to the Reinvestment 
Account.  In the event of this day not being a Business Day, the transfer will be 
made on the Business Day immediately before. The transfers will be made with 
at a weekly interval in the assumptions set forth in section 3.4.4.1. of the 
Additional Module.   The first  Calculation Date will be November  20th, 2005. 
  
 “Collection Period” ,  a period that coincides with the calendar month.  Fund 
liquidations of the amounts collected from the borrowers will be performed 
during these periods. The first Collection Period will be between the Date of 
Constitution and the last day of October, 2005.  
 “Notification Dates”, the second Business Day prior to each Payment Date 
during the whole life of the Fund.  On these dates the Sociedad Gestora will 
notify the amounts to be paid for principal and interest to the holders of the 
Bonds issued, in the manner described in section 4.1.3.1. of the Additional 
Module. 
 
4.9.3 
Early Redemption of the Bond Issue. 
Independently of the Fund's obligation, through the Sociedad Gestora, to 
redeem the Bonds of each Series on the Legal Maturity Date, (October 26th, 
2043]), or if it is not a Business Day, the next Business Day), or to execute 
partial redemptions on each Payment Date, as detailed above, the Sociedad 
Gestora is authorised to proceed with the Early Liquidation of the Fund and thus 
the Early Redemption (hereinafter, "Early Redemption") on a Payment Date, 
of the entire Bond Issue, in accordance with the Events of Early Liquidation and 
with the requirements detailed under section 4.4.3 of the Registration Document 
and with adherence to the Payment Priority Order set forth in section 3.4.6.2 of 
the Additional Module. 
4.10 
Indication of the yield 
The main characteristic of the Bonds of this Issue is that their periodic redemption 
depends on the aggregate behaviour of the Mortgage Loans.  
The average life, yield, duration and final maturity of the Bonds of each Series depends 
on diverse factors, the most significant of which are as follows:

47
a) 
The repayment system and calendar for each of the Mortgage Loans 
established in the related contracts. 
b) 
The capacity of the Debtors to prepay, in full or in part, the Mortgage Loans 
and the speed at which such prepayment takes place in aggregate over the 
life of the Fund. 
c) 
The floating interest rates that will apply to each of the Mortgage Loans, 
which will cause the amount of each repayment instalment to vary. 
d) 
Delinquency of the debtors in making the Mortgage Loan repayments. 
 
In this regard, prepayments by the Debtors of the Mortgage Loans are very significant. 
The prepayments are subject to continuous change and in this Prospectus are estimated 
using several assumptions for the future behaviour of the constant effective annual 
prepayment rate (hereinafter, “TAA”) which will have a direct bearing on the velocity at 
which the Bonds are redeemed and hence on their average life and duration.  
To calculate the data shown in the tables contained in this section, the following 
assumptions have been made regarding the aforesaid factors: 
1. The annual Nominal Interest Rates applicable to the Bonds of Series 
A and B,  variable quarterly, taking as a reference the Euribor rate on 
September 19 2005, i.e., 2.136%, and assuming that the final spread  
applicable will be set at 0.12% for Series A Bonds and 0.33% for 
Series B Bonds, will be maintained constant throughout the term of 
the debt securities at the following rates: 
Series A Bonds 
Series B Bonds 
Nominal Interest Rate 
2.256% 
2.466% 
 
 
2. weighted average interest rate for the Mortgage Transfer Certificates 
portfolio: 3.246%; 
3. outstandings more than thirty (30)  days past due in the Mortgage 
Transfer Certificates portfolio: 0% annual; 
4. defaults in the Mortgage Shares and Transfer Certificates portfolio: 
0.3% annual, from October 2006, with a recovery rate of defaulted 
mortgages of 75% one year later; 
5. that the Closing Date for the Securitisation Bonds is October 10 
2005]; 
Assuming the Sociedad Gestora will exercise the option for Early Liquidation of the 
Fund and Early Redemption of the Bond Issue, when the Nominal Outstanding Balance 
of the Mortgage Loans is less than 10% of its initial amount on the date of constitution

(iii) 
On each of the Interest Fixing Dates, notify the Sociedad Gestora of the Reference

and Certificates grouped in the Fund. 
Without prejudice to the provisions of the preceding section, lack of confirmation prior to 
the Subscription Period, of the provisional credit ratings granted to the Bonds by the 
Credit Rating Agencies will be an event of termination of the Financial Services Contract 
and the rest of the Fund contracts. 
In the event that the rating of the Payment Agent authorised by the Rating Agencies for 
short term risk, where the current rating is P-1 in the case of Moody’s and F1+ in the case 
of Fitch, were reduced to below P-1 in the case of Moody’s or to F1 in the case of Fitch, 
or the rating were for whatever reason, revoked by the Rating Agencies, the Sociedad 
Gestora must exercise, at the Fund’s cost, within 30 days following the reduction, in order 
to maintain the ratings assigned to each of the Series of Bonds by the Rating Agencies, 
and with prior notification to them, one of the required options described below. These 
options will allow an adequate level of guarantee to be maintained with respect to the 
commitments derived from the functions as Placement Entities of the Shares and 
Certificates, Payment Agent and maintenance of the Fund’s Account.  
(a) 
To obtain guarantees or similar commitments from a credit entity or entities with 
a rating of no less than P-1, where assigned by Moody’s, and no less than F1, 
where assigned by Fitch, that guarantees the commitments assumed by the 
Payment Agent.

case of Moody’s and F1 in the case of Fitch, who will assume, under the same 
conditions, the functions of the Payment Agent.

the investor. 
7.5  Credit ratings assigned by the Rating Agencies 
The Bonds included in this Asset Document have been assigned the following provisional 
ratings by the following credit risk agencies on September 30, 2005 (from hereon Fitch 
and Moody’s will be referred to jointly as the “Rating Agencies”): 
 
Fitch 
Moody’s 
Series A 
AAA 
Aaa 
Series B 
A 
A2 
 
The ratings assigned to each of the Bond Series by Moody’s measure the expected losses 
prior to the Legal Maturity Date. In the opinion of  Moody’s the structure permits the 
occasional payment of interest and the payment of principal during the life of the 
transaction and at all events, prior to the Legal Maturity Date of the Fund. 
The ratings assigned to the A and B Bond Series by Fitch measure the Fund’s capacity to 
fulfil the payments of interest and  principal on an occasional basis on each foreseen 
Payment Date and during the life of the transaction and in any case, prior to the Legal 
Maturity Date, in accordance with the terms set forth for each Series in the Prospectus 
and the Deed of Constitution which permit the deferment of interest payments on the 
Series B Bonds in certain circumstances. This means that the interest on these Bonds may 
not be received during a certain length of time if the conditions set forth for the deferment 
are not met, but without this circumstance causing an event of breach of payment 
obligations of the Bonds. 
The scale of ratings for long term debt employed by the agencies are as follows:

Moody’s applies the numeric modifiers, 1, 2 and 3 to each generic rating category 
from Aa to B. Modifier 1 indicates that the bond is situated in the upper band of each 
generic rating category, modifier 2 indicates a medium band and modifier 3 indicates 
the lower band of each generic category.

These ratings do not constitute a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. The 
credit rating may be revised, suspended or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency.  
The aforementioned credit ratings are only an estimate and should not prevent 
prospective investors from making their own analysis of the securities that they wish to 
acquire. 
In making its analysis Moody's has puts its trust in the representations made by the 
entities participating in the transaction, by their auditors and legal advisers, and by other 
experts on the exactness and completeness of the information that has been provided to it  
in relation with the rating and ensuing follow-up. 
The ratings assigned by Moody's in the creation of the Fund may be subject to revision, 
suspension or withdrawal at any time, depending on any information that comes to its 
knowledge. The initial rating and all revisions or suspensions thereof: 
- 
Are formulated by Moody's on the basis of a great number of data it receives 
and for which Moody's does not guarantee their exactness or completeness, in such a way 
that under no circumstances could Moody's be held liable for the same. 
- 
They do not constitute and may under no circumstances be construed to 
constitute an invitation, recommendation or encouragement to the Bondholders to 
proceed with any kind of transaction on the Bonds, and in particular, to purchase,  
conserve, encumber or sell such Bonds.  
- 
Neither does it reflect the market conditions or the potential needs of any 
investor in particular. 
The ratings assigned Fitch are based on documents and information furnished by  the 
issuer and its experts and agents and are subject to reception of the final documents.  
Fitch does not audit, verify or check the truthfulness, exactness or accuracy of the above-
mentioned information. 
The ratings do not constitute a recommendation to purchase, sell or conserve the bonds. 
Neither do they constitute an analysis on the  market price, the suitability of the bonds for 
any particular investor or tax exemption or the taxable nature of the payments made in 
relation to the bonds. 
The ratings may be modified, withdrawn, suspended or put on “Rating Watch” as the 
result of changes in the information or the accuracy of the information, or due to the

reception of additional information as a consequence of insufficiency in the data or for 
any other reason that Fitch deems sufficient. 
The Sociedad Gestora, on behalf of the Fund, undertakes to provide the Rating Agencies 
with periodic information regarding the situation of the Fund and the behaviour of the 
Mortgage Loans in order that they may be able to continue to rate the Bonds. Similarly, it 
will supply the aforementioned information whenever reasonably requested to do so, and 
in any event, when changes arise in the conditions of the Fund, in the contracts entered by 
the Fund through its Sociedad Gestora or in the interested parties. 
Lack of confirmation prior to the start of the Bond Subscription Period, of any of the 
provisional ratings granted to the Bonds by the Credit Rating Agencies will be considered 
an event of termination with respect to the issue and subscription of the Mortgage Shares 
and Certificates, the Initial Expenses Loan, the Subordinated Loan, the Participative Loan 
and the rest of the Fund contracts, the Constitution of the Fund and the Bond Issue.

1.1 
Minimum denomination of the issue 
The Mortgage Shares and Mortgage Transfer Certificates making up the Fund assets at 
the time of its constitution will have an initial principal amount equal to or slightly under 
two billion (2,000,000,000) Euros.

Confirmation that the information on a company or debtor not participating in 
the issue has been accurately reproduced.  
Not applicable.  
2. UNDERLYING ASSETS 
2.1 
Confirmation of the capacity of the securitized assets to produce the funds 
payable on the securities. 
In accordance with the information supplied by CAM, verified by the Placement Entities,  
Rating Agencies and the Sociedad Gestora, the Mortgage Transfer Certificates to be 
issued and will be backed by the Mortgage Loans, have the characteristics (amount, time 
frame, interest rate, etc..) that demonstrate the capacity to produce funds and make the 
payments owed and payable on the Bonds, without prejudice to payments on the Bonds 
by the Fund having to be executed in accordance with the Priority Order of Payments, 
and the subordination existing between the different Series.  
Nevertheless, in order to strengthen the financial structure and achieve the greatest 
possible hedge of the risk inherent in the issue, the Sociedad Gestora, on behalf of the 
Fund, will proceed on the same day as the Deed of Constitution, to execute the 
agreements and perform the acts stipulated in section 3.4.2 and 3.4.4. of this Additional 
Module.  
Furthermore, since not all of the Bonds have the same risk of default, the Rating Agencies 
have assigned each of the Series with the credit ratings set out in section 7.5 of the Asset 
Document. 
With prejudice to the foregoing, the Sociedad Gestora, after first notifying the CNMV,  
will be empowered to proceed with the Early Liquidation of the Fund and hence the Early

2.2 
Assets backing the issue 
The credit rights constituting the Fund assets will be solely owned by CAM, derived from  
mortgage loans granted by CAM to individuals for the purchase, construction or 
refurbishment of a property located in Spanish territory, with a first-rate housing mortgage 
guarantee whose authorisation has been subject to Spanish legislation (the “Mortgage 
Loans”). 
The Mortgage Loans will be transferred by CAM to the Fund through the issue of Mortgage 
Shares and Mortgage Transfer Certificates in accordance with the individual characteristics 
of each of the Mortgage Loans. 
On the Date of Constitution, the Shares and Certificates to be transferred to the Fund will be 
extracted from the loans in the portfolio audited on September 1, 2005, which is composed 
of 23,645 mortgage loans with a Nominal Balance pending collection of 2,480,551,485.71 
euros. 
Ernst & Young, whose particulars can be found in paragraph 2.1 of the Registration 
Document, has drawn up an auditor’s report for the Sociedad Gestora, on the issue of Shares 
and Certificates for pooling in the Fondo de Titulización de Activos TDA CAM 5, for the 
purpose of complying with the provisions of article 5 of Royal Decree 926/1998.  This 
Auditor’s Report concerns a series of quantitative and qualitative attributes of the loans, and 
in particular:  their purpose, identification of the borrower, date of formalisation, final 
maturity date, reference interest rate, interest rate applied, interest rate differential, initial 
balance, current balance, payments in arrears, appraisal value,   current balance and appraisal 
value ratio, addressed of the mortgaged property, mortgage backing and damages insurance 
cover. 
This Report has been prepared on a selection of mortgage loans extracted from the 23,645 
mortgage lenders with a balance as at September 1,  2005 of 2,480,551,485.71 euros making 
up the audited portfolio, using sampling techniques that constitute a generally-accepted 
method for verifying the  registers maintained by an entity in relation to a series of items  
(“population”), which enable a conclusion to be drawn on that population by means of 
analysing a number of lower items (“sample”) to that of the total group. The level of 
confidence indicates the probability that the real number of items with deviations in respect 
of an existing guideline in a population does not exceed a previously-established limit 
(“precision”).  Any mortgage loans of the CAM portfolio in which errors have been detected 
during the audit will not be assigned to the Fund on its date of constitution.

AUDITED PORTFOLIO, TDA CAM 5 ISSUE
(Grouped by Loan to Value)


This prospectus is a translation into English of the original "Folleto" drafted in Spanish language and registered with the 
"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores" (the Spanish Securities Market Commission, "CNMV") on October 4, 2005. The 
"Folleto" drafted in the Spanish language is the only official document, and no document other than the "Folleto" shall have any 
legal effect or be relied upon with regard to the Note Issue. 
 
2.2.7 
Method of creation of the assets. 
Description of the process: 
Application 
Processing of a loan commences with the application by the interested party for 
a loan that is sufficient to cover his/her finance needs. 
Based on the Caja’s investment policy in respect of the purpose for which the 
capital is to be used, the guarantee provided and the repayment capacity, the 
Office or manager determines the type of loan that is most suitable for the 
client, informing him/her of the characteristics and terms of the operation (term, 
method of payment, charges, interest rate, etc.) and the documents the client 
must furnish. 
Analysis of loan extension 
The decision for all loan applications entails a previous study of the 
documentation furnished, a verification of the assets declared, a knowledge of 
risks involved and the relationship with the Caja’s officers, and with other 
entities, in addition to external information, all of which is recorded in the 
Report-Proposal. 
In addition to applying realistic profitability criteria that are compatible with the  
Caja’s social facet, the fundamental principle in all credit investments is to 
weigh up the amounts, purpose, possibilities of repayment, solvency and 
guarantees provided for the transactions, ensuring as far as possible that the 
principal of the loan can be repaid. 
b1)  Feasibility study 
The feasibility of the transaction must be taken into account prior to the analysis 
of the guarantees. 
a.-  Applicants receiving a fixed income (salaried workers, retired persons and 
pensioners):  the income derived from permanent or temporary employment 
agreements is calculated; evaluation of the actual net earnings, after deducting 
taxes, social security payments, etc.; accreditation of the earnings declared, 
incorporating into the file any documents that justify them; consultation with 
external sources such as the Bank of Spain Risk Information Bureau (for the 
applicant and guarantors). 
b.-  Applicants who are independent professionals (free-lance, agents receiving 
commission, etc.):   the income declared is accredited by providing photocopies 
of documents that justify these.  (Trade Licence Declaration, VAT Settlements, 
Liquidation of commissions collected, Billing, etc.); consultation with external 
sources such as the Bank of Spain Risk Information Bureau (for the applicant 
and guarantors).

"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores" (the Spanish Securities Market Commission, "CNMV") on October 4, 2005. The 
"Folleto" drafted in the Spanish language is the only official document, and no document other than the "Folleto" shall have any 
legal effect or be relied upon with regard to the Note Issue. 
 
74
b2)   Study on the applicant’s patrimony 
Pre-classification implies the approval of the transaction, however since 
additional information may exist that has not been evaluated by the system (e.g., 
the guarantee provided for mortgage transactions; the branch director will be 
authorised to oppose the formalising of any transaction. 
Documentary requirements 
It is compulsory for applicants to submit a Declaration of Property and Assets. 
Additional documentation to be provided by the applicants, if the office has no 
record  on them or if the transaction exceeds their approval limits: 
Accreditation of the identity of the applicants, accreditation as to their  
solvency; accreditation as to the possibilities of repaying the loan; guarantee of 
collection of the payments; appraisal of the property guaranteeing the 
transaction; documentation on transactions with mortgage guarantee. 
Decision-taking bodies 
The authority to take the decision as to whether to extend the loan corresponds 
to the Board of Directors, which in turn delegates part of its attributions to the 
Executive Committee, the Regional Boards and the Director General, who will 
proceed in turn to use his own authority, delegating his attributions in the 
following manner and finally reaching the Regional Risk Directors, Risk 
Directors, Corporate Office Directors and Branch Directors. 
The risk control systems for each of the risk categories defined show a level of 
development that is marked by the very exposure of the Caja to each category: 
Credit risk 
Considering the importance of the credit risk on the Caja’s operations, the credit 
risk control systems see this as a continuous process, tracking the same from the 
analysis phase to the cancellation and facilitating control in all undesired 
situations in which there is a decline in the credit quality. 
For the granting phase, CAM has tools of a quantitative nature such as proactive 
and reactive scoring for individuals and the internal rating model for companies, 
which serve as support to our professionals in taking decisions in an objective 
manner: 
a)Companies rating: the purpose of this rating is to verify the past and future 
economic and financial evolution of companies who are clients of CAM in 
order to measure their repayment capacity in existing credit transactions and/or 
future proposals, and is a basic tool in achieving adequate information, analysis 
and tracking of CAM corporate clients. 


This prospectus is a translation into English of the original "Folleto" drafted in Spanish language and registered with the 
"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores" (the Spanish Securities Market Commission, "CNMV") on October 4, 2005. The 
"Folleto" drafted in the Spanish language is the only official document, and no document other than the "Folleto" shall have any 
legal effect or be relied upon with regard to the Note Issue. 
 
75
b)Pre-rating or Proactive scoring (Only for individuals): This method is used to 
analyse the behaviour of clients in the face of risk, which, after evaluating the 
historic relationship of the client with the Entity, through handling a series of 
variables, enables the Caja to quantify the potential risk that a client can assume 
based on certain parameters of expected default.  
CAM Credit Scoring: These systems are based on the estimation of a 
Discriminating Analysis model, with which the aim is to automatically take 
decisions as to whether or not to grant a specific credit transaction, reducing the 
analysis time and homogenising criteria.  
At the same time a revision and/or updating of risk policies has been carried out 
which has led to both the revision of the approval authorities and the 
modification of the transaction-approval circuit design, resulting in 
improvements in efficiency and in the granting processes, with greater 
specialisation in  analysing transactions. 
The function of risk-tracking is one of the most important parts of the credit 
policy and as a result, current procedures for tracking and controlling credit 
granted enable it to predict situations of default, with the following distinctions 
being made: 
a. Reactive tracking in the face of alarm signals, the evaluation of which will 
lead to adopting the most suitable measures for minimising default. 
b. Proactive tracking, which will include: 
•The systematic revision of the  borrower’s financial situation 
•Information requirements necessary during the lifetime of the credit 
transactions 
•Control of specific conditions established in approving the transactions  
This is a dynamic process in which different hierarchies of the organisation may 
intervene at in any given time, and depending on the circumstances. Each 
hierarchy controls  compliance of the established terms, and the suitability of 
the contents included in the required plans for regularisation or tracking reports, 
within the scope of its authority.. 
In the recovery activity, active management of irregular risks is performed, 
based on criteria of efficiency and profitability at both branch level and through 
the Central Recoveries Commissions and Regional Management. In this respect 
the systems and circuits for recovering unpaid credit are organised around 
complementary circuits: individual persons and corporations, both of which are 
completely separated from each other in terms of the type of management and 
those responsible for managing the recoveries. Both circuits will add greater 
efficiency and speed to the processes, eliminating unproductive time and 
automating changes of phases in the overall management with the holders.

"Folleto" drafted in the Spanish language is the only official document, and no document other than the "Folleto" shall have any 
legal effect or be relied upon with regard to the Note Issue. 
 
76
Lastly, credit risk management contemplates controlling the risk of concentrating the 
portfolio, which is being constantly tracked through operating limits. Consequently, 
together with the vocational and priority-based guidance in the retail business is the  
increase in the Caja’s scope of action which is the objective of its ambitious plan of 
expansion. This has led to approximately one-third of the business growth in 2004  being 
generated outside the more traditional markets with the ensuing reduction in  
concentration in certain areas. 
2.2.8 
Indication of representations and warranties given to the issuer with respect 
to the assets.

and the Sociedad Gestora in the Deed of Constitution, with respect to itself, the

2.2.9 
Substitution of the securitized assets. 
In the exceptional circumstance where, following the Date of Constitution, despite 
the declarations made by the Seller and its efforts to ensure compliance, it is 
discovered that during the life of the Fund, one of the Shares and/or Certificates or 
one of the Mortgage Loans which it issued, does not comply, on the Date of 
Constitution, with the representations set out in section 2.2.8. of this Additional 
Module and in Stipulation 9.2 of the Deed of Constitution of the Fund, the Seller 
undertakes: 
(A) 
To replace the corresponding Share and/or Certificate by another one with similar 
financial characteristics in terms of amount pending collection, term to maturity, 
interest rate, characteristics of the debtor and mortgaged property and current live 
balance/appraisal value ratio that are acceptable to the Sociedad Gestora, notified 
to the Rating Agencies and while not affecting the rating assigned to the Bonds.  
The amounts accrued and not paid, up to the date of replacement,  of the Share 
and/or Certificate to be replaced will be paid to the Fund by the Seller, in its 
capacity as administrator, at the time of replacement of the aforementioned Share 
and/or Certificate.   
In any case, in the event of replacing a Share and/or Certificate, the seller must 
demonstrate that the Share and/or Certificate is in accordance with the conditions 
referred to in section 2.2.8. of this Additional Module. The Sociedad Gestora will 
verify the suitability  of the terms of the replacement Share or Certificate.

"Folleto" drafted in the Spanish language is the only official document, and no document other than the "Folleto" shall have any 
legal effect or be relied upon with regard to the Note Issue. 
 
81
As soon as the Seller becomes aware that a Share and/or Certificate issued or 
underlying Mortgage Loan does not correspond to the cited representations, it 
should inform the Sociedad Gestora and within a term of five (5) days,  and 
indicate the Mortgage Loans that will be presented to replace the faulty ones which 
will underlie the issue of new mortgage shares and/or mortgage transfer 
certificates. In the event that any of the Shares and Certificates are substituted in 
accordance with these provisions, the Seller will issue a new Multiple Security, 
which will be substituted for the one provided in accordance with the agreement on 
the Date of Constitution.  
The Seller undertakes to formalise the replacement of the shares and Certificates in 
a public deed and in the manner and time frame stipulated by the Sociedad Gestora, 
and to provide that information regarding the aforementioned Shares and 
Certificates that the Sociedad Gestora deems necessary. This substitution will be 
notified to the Rating Agencies and a copy of the official document will be sent to 
the CNMV. 
(B) 
In addition to the obligations assumed in point (A) above, and in the exceptional 
cases where replacement is not possible because the available mortgage loans, for 
reasons not attributable to the Seller, are not similar to the securitized portfolio in 
terms (i) amount, (ii) term to maturity, (iii) interest rate, (iv) characteristics of the 
debtor,(v) characteristics of the mortgaged property, or (vi) current live balance 
/appraisal value ratio, the Seller will agree to the early reimbursement of the Share 
and/or Certificate in question, through a cash refund, of the pending capital of the 
corresponding Share and/or Certificate and of the interests accrued and not paid to 
date, as well as any other amount relative to the Share and/or Certificate 
corresponding to the Fund, paid to the Reinvestment Account.. The amounts 
received from the Shares and/ or Certificates affected as mentioned above will be 
incorporated into Available Resources and  used  on the next Payment Date. 
Specifically, the modification by the Seller during the life of the Mortgage Loans of the 
conditions without adhering to the limitations set out in the special applicable legislation 
and to the terms agreed between the Fund and the Seller in the Deed of Constitution of the 
Fund and in this Asset Document, in section 3.7.1 of the Additional Module, represents the 
breach by the Seller of its obligations which should not be assumed by the Fund. In the 
event of such a breach, the Fund, through the Sociedad Gestora, may (i) demand the 
corresponding compensation for damages and (ii) proceed with the replacement or refund 
of the Shares and/or Certificates affected, in conformance with that described in points (A) 
and (B) above, which does not suppose that the Seller guarantees the good termination of 
the operation, but the necessary repair of the effects produced by the breach of its 
obligations, in compliance with Article 1.124 of the Civil Code. The expenses incurred for 
correcting the breach of the Seller will be charged to the Seller, without being able to pass 
them on to the Fund. 
2.2.10 Material insurance policies relating to the securitized assets. 
In accordance with the representations and warranties contained in section 2.2.8. of the 
Additional Module above, all of the properties mortgaged as security for the Mortgage 
Loans are currently insured, at least, against fire damage, with a sum insured of not lower 
than the valuation of the mortgaged property, excluding the items that are not insurable by

and Mortgage Transfer Certificates of the corresponding rights it is entitled to as 
beneficiary of the mentioned insurance policies subscribed by the Debtors, or any other 
insurance Policy which offers the same cover. Thus it will correspond to the Fund as owner 
of the Mortgage Shares and Mortgage Transfer Certificates, all the amounts that would 
have been due to CAM under this reference. 
2.2.11 Information regarding the debtors for those cases where the securitized 
assets including obligations of five or fewer debtors with corporate

Description of the entities participating in the issue and a description of the

3.3 
Description of the method and date of sale, transfer, substitution or assignment 
of the assets, or of any rights and/or obligations in the assets to the issuer. 
3.3.1 
General terms for the issue of and subscription to Mortgage Bond Holdings 
and Mortgage Transfer Certificates. 
The Mortgage Loans will be transferred to the Fund through the issue of Shares and 
Certificates by the Seller and their subscription by the Sociedad Gestora on behalf of the 
Fund, in virtue of the Deed of Constitution and this Asset Document. The Shares and 
Certificates are issued for a total nominal value equal to or slightly less than 
2,000,000,000 Euros. Each Share and Certificate participated in 100% of the un-
amortised principal of each of the Mortgage Loans, accruing an interest rate equal to the 
nominal interest rate, at any time, on the corresponding Mortgage Loans. 
The unconditional and full sale of the credit rights derived from the Mortgage Loans to 
the Fund, with the exceptions accounted for in section 3.3.3. of this Additional Module, 
through the issue of Shares and Certificates, will take place on the Date of Constitution 
for the remaining term of maturity of the loans without the existence of any repurchase 
pact by the Seller. The Shares and Certificates will begin to accrue interest from the Date 
of Constitution (included), that is October 5, 2005, and therefore the interest accrued by 
the Mortgage Loans from that date will correspond to the Fund, independently from the 
accrual period taken into consideration to calculate the interest.

The Seller will not assume any liability whatsoever for the non-payment by the Mortgage 
debtors of the principal, the interest or any other amount that may be due by virtue of the 
Mortgage Loans. The Seller does not, under any circumstance, assume any responsibility 
for guaranteeing, either directly or indirectly, the success of the transaction, nor will it 
authorise guarantees or warranties, nor enters into repurchase agreements for the Shares 
and Certificates, nor by virtue of the Deed of Constitution of the Fund, this Asset 
Document, or any other agreement or contract. 
The Seller will be responsible to the Fund for the existence and validity of the Mortgage 
Loans, as indicated in Articles 348 of the Commercial Code and 1.529 of the Civil Code. 
3.3.2 
Issue Price of the Mortgage Bond Holdings and the Mortgage Transfer 
Certificates. 
 
On the Date of Constitution of the Fund, the Sociedad Gestora shall subscribe 100% of 
the Shares and Certificates on behalf of the Fund. 
The Price of the Shares and Certificates will be their Nominal Balance Pending 
Collection, on the Date of Constitution of the Fund,   and will be paid by the Sociedad 
Gestora, on behalf of the Fund, to the Seller on the Disbursement Date, which is October 
10, 2005. 
In the event of the cancellation of the constitution of the Fund, and consequently of the 
issue and subscription of the Shares and Certificates, (i) payment obligations by the Fund 
from the Shares and Certificates will be cancelled, and (ii) the Sociedad Gestora will 
return to the Seller any right accrued in favour of the Fund by the Shares and Certificates.  
 
3.3.3 
Description of the rights conferred on the Fund by subscription to the 
Mortgage Shares and Mortgage Transfer Certificates of the Mortgage 
Loans. 
The Fund, as holder of the Shares and Certificates, shall have the rights recognised in the 
applicable legislation and in the Shares and Certificates. In particular, it will have the 
right to receive all the payments made for principal and interest by the Mortgage Loan 
Debtors, with the exceptions outlined in the following paragraph, together with any other 
payment arising from the Mortgage Loans, provided such payments correspond to the 
Shares and Certificates. The Shares and Certificates will begin to accrue interest from the 
Date of Constitution. 
In addition to the payments made by the Mortgage Loan debtors, any other payments 
received by the Seller from the Mortgage Loans, including those arising from any 
ancillary rights to the Mortgage Loans, such as compensation derived from insurance 
policies, payments made by possible guarantors, etc, will correspond to the Fund, with the

exception of commissions arising from delinquent interest, unpaid receipt claims, 
subrogation and prepayment, together with any other commission that may correspond to 
the Seller of the Shares and Certificates.  
Additionally, the Fund will have the right to receive the amounts, assets or payment rights 
of principal or interest of the Mortgage Loans, either for the sale price or for the amount 
established by judicial or notary resolution in the foreclosure of the mortgages, for the 
sale or exploitation of the properties foreclosed or as a consequence of these foreclosures, 
in administration and internal possession of the properties undergoing foreclosure. The 
Seller will make necessary notifications so that the payments to the Sociedad Gestora are 
made.  
The Seller must undertake reasonable efforts to maintain to their full extent, the insurance 
policies in relation to the Mortgage Loans, and it will be responsible for any damage to 
the Fund in the event that the insurance policies have not been maintained. 
 
3.3.4 
Representation and custody of the Mortgage Bond Holdings and Mortgage 
Transfer Certificates. 
The Shares and Certificates grouped in the Fund will be represented by two Multiple 
Securities, one representing all of the Bond Holdings and the other representing all of the 
Certificates. 
Both if the Sociedad Gestora proceeds with the replacement of a Mortgage Loan for and 
on behalf of the Fund as established in section 2.2.9. of this Additional Module, or the 
execution of a Mortgage Loan as provided for in section 3.7.1. of the Additional Module, 
and if in the event of Early Liquidation of the Fund in the circumstances and conditions in 
section 4.4.3 of the Registration Document, the Mortgage Bond Holdings and/or 
Mortgage Transfer Certificates must be sold, as well as in any other event that so 
requires. The Seller commits itself to fraction any multiple security representing the 
Mortgage Bond Holdings and/or the Mortgage Transfer Certificates into as many 
individual or multiple securities as necessary or to substitute or exchange them in order to 
achieve the aforementioned objectives. 
The Multiple Securities representing the Mortgage Bond Holdings and Mortgage Transfer 
Certificates, and if applicable, the individual securities into which they may be fractioned 
will be deposited with the Payment Agent who will act as their Custodian. 
 
3.3.5 
Other conditions of the Mortgage Bond Holdings and Mortgage Transfer 
Certificates legal framework. 
As established in Royal Decree 685/1982, the Mortgage Bond Holdings and the Mortgage 
Transfer Certificates shall be transferable by written declaration on the security itself and 
generally by any of the means legally allowed in accordance with Article 67.1 of Royal 
Decree 685/1982, with the acquisition and ownership limited to institutional or 
professional investors and not permitted for the non-specialised public, in accordance

with Article 64.1 of Royal Decree 685/1982. The purchaser must inform the issuer both 
of such a transfer and of the address of the new owner.  
The Seller shall not be responsible for the solvency of either the Issuer or the Debtor, nor 
the sufficiency of the mortgage guarantee. 
3.4 
Explanation of the Fund Cash Flow. 
3.4.1 
How the flows of the assets will serve the Issuer to comply with its 
commitments to the Bondholders. 
As illustrated in the diagram in section 3.1. of this Additional Module, the flows 
of assets will serve to fulfil the obligations of the issuer in the following way: 
a) On the Disbursement Date, the Fund will pay the price of the Mortgage 
Bond Holdings and Mortgage Transfer Certificates issued, with the amount 
of the principal received of the Series A and B Bonds. 
b) On the Disbursement Date, the Fund will receive the amount for the Initial 
Expenses Loan and the amount for the Participative Loan. 
c) Similarly, on the Disbursement Date, the Participative Loan will be paid 
into the Reserve Fund.  
d) Every month, on each Collection Date, the Sociedad Gestora, for and on 
behalf of the Fund, will receive the amounts that the Mortgage Loan 
debtors have paid for the principal and interest during each Collection 
Period. These amounts will be deposited in the Reinvestment Account, 
accruing an interest rate in accordance with the Guaranteed Interest Rate 
Deposit Agreement (Investment Account),  which will cover the payments 
of the Fund on each Payment Date, in keeping with the Payment Priority 
Ranking.  
e) Technical Advance. Taking into account that some of the delays in the 
payments made by the borrowers have an interim or technical nature, and 
with the objective of avoiding that such delays have a negative impact on 
the flow of payments to the Bondholders, and taking into account that there 
is a lapse of 20 days between the end of the Collection Period and the 
Collection Date on behalf of the Fund, and that the amounts collected by 
the Seller as Loan administrator are property of the fund, the Sociedad 
Gestora, on behalf of the Fund, will be entitled to receive on every 
Collection Date, an advance backed by such amounts, which will be 
deposited in the Reinvestment Account.  
The amount of the Technical Advance cannot exceed the amount collected 
by the Seller from the Mortgage Loans it administers, for any payment that 
the Fund will be entitled to as holder of the Shares and Certificates, from

the end of the last Collection Period until the Collection date on which the 
Technical Advance is requested. 
f) 
The amounts received from the Mortgage Loans on each Collection Date, 
corresponding to the three (3) Collection Periods prior to the corresponding 
Payment Date, the amount of the Technical Advance, the interests accrued 
from the Reinvestment Account, the Net Amount in favour of the Fund in 
virtue of the Financial Interest Swap Contract and the amount that makes 
up the Reserve Fund at all times will be used on each Payment Date to pay 
the accrued interest and reimbursement of the principal of the Bonds of 
both Series, in accordance with the Priority Ranking of Payments described 
in section 3.4.6.2. of the Additional Module. 
3.4.2 
Information on all credit enhancements. 
As a credit enhancement mechanism against possible losses due to unpaid 
and/or defaulted Mortgage Loans, and with an end to allowing the Fund to 
make payments in accordance with the Priority Order of Payments, it is decided 
to form a Reserve Fund that shall initially be provisioned with the payment of 
the Participative Loan, whose characteristics are described in section 3.4.3.4. of 
the Additional Module.  
In addition, the subordination of the Bonds of Series B in the payment of 
interest and reimbursement of the principal arising from their ranking in the  
Priority Order of Payments constitutes a credit enhancement mechanism for the 
Bonds in the different series.  
In order to eliminate the interest rate risk arising in Shares and Certificates 
subject to variable interest rates with different reference indices and different 
revision periods and instalment payment dates of the variable interest 
established for each Bond Series issued payable to the Fund, as well as the risk; 
under the regulations for the modification and replacement of mortgage loans, 
that the Shares and Certificates may be subject to renegotiations that lower the 
agreed interest rate, the Sociedad Gestora will sign an Interest Swap Contract 
with CAM, described in 3.4.7.1. of this Additional Module.  
With the objective of mitigating the risk of exposure of the revenues received 
from the debtors in an account outside the Fund, the Sociedad Gestora will 
arrange with CAM a Guaranteed Interest Rate Deposit Contract through which  
CAM undertakes to transfer to the Fund, initially on a monthly basis, such 
amounts into an account opened in the name of the Fund in CAM, the 
Reinvestment Account, with the guarantees and limitations set forth  in that 
Contract, a brief description of which will be given in section 3.4.4.1 of the 
Additional Module. 
In general, the quality of the Mortgage Loans and the protective mechanisms 
and financial operations established for maintaining the financial balance of the 
Fund are such that they have been considered sufficient by the Rating Agencies

Asset Document.

Details of any subordinated debt funding. 
3.4.3.1 
Initial Expenses Loan 
The Seller shall grant, in accordance with the Initial Expenses Loan Contract, a 
Subordinated Loan to the Fund (hereinafter, “Initial Expenses Loan”) for a 
maximum total amount of 1,637,500,000 Euros. 
The final amount of the Initial expenses loan shall be determined by the  
Sociedad Gestora on October 6, 2005, once the Placement Entities notify, as 
defined in section 4.2.2 of the Asset document, the final underwriting 
commissions to be applied to the Bonds of each Series.  The Sociedad Gestora 
shall notify to CAM this final amount of the Initial Expenses Loan, before 
13:00 (CET) on October 6, 2005.  The final amount shall be advanced on the 
Disbursement Date to the Fund’s account opened with the Payment Agent.  The 
final amount of the Initial Expenses Loan shall be included in the disbursement 
deed. 
The amount shall be assigned by the Sociedad Gestora to pay the initial 
expenses of the Fund that correspond to Constitution of the Fund and Issue of 
the Bonds. 
The Initial Expenses Loan shall accrue an annual variable quarterly interest rate 
equal to the Reference Interest Rate of the Bonds determined for each Interest 
Accrual Period in force from time to time, plus a margin of 0.75%.  Such 
interest will be paid only if the Fund has sufficient liquid funds available, in 
accordance with the Fund Payments Priority Ranking. The interest will be paid 
on each of the Payment Dates and will be calculated taking as a basis: (i) the 
effective days existing in each Interest Accrual Period and (ii) one year 
consisting of three hundred and sixty (360) days. Payment of this interest will 
be subject to the Priority Ranking of Payment as provided for in section 3.4.6.2. 
of the Additional Module. 
The amortisation of the principal amount of the Initial Expenses Loan shall be 
made in 20 equal and consecutive instalments, the first shall take place on the 
initial Payment Date (January 26, 2006), and the remaining on the following 
Payment Dates, all in accordance with the Priority Order of Payments described 
in section 3.4.6.2. of the Additional Module. 
Lack of confirmation prior to the start of the Subscription Period of any of the 
provisional credit ratings granted to the Bonds by the Credit Rating Agencies ill 
constitute an event for terminating the Initial Expenses Loan Contract. 
All the amounts payable to the Seller, as both interest accrued and amortisation

Module.  
All the amounts that pursuant to the above paragraphs are not provided to the 
Seller shall be paid on subsequent Payment Dates when Available Resources 
allow, in accordance with the established Priority Order and will be paid with 
priority given to the amounts that would be payable in relation with the Initial

Subordinated loan 
The seller shall grant, pursuant to the Subordinated Loan Contract, a 
Subordinated Loan to the Fund, (hereinafter, “Subordinated Loan”) for a total 
amount of 7,000,000 Euros. 
The amount of the Subordinated Loan shall be advanced to the Fund’s account 
opened with the Payment Agent, on the business day prior to the first Payment 
Date. 
The Sociedad Gestora must only assign this amount to cover the difference, on 
the Fund’s first Payment Date, equal to the interest accrued on said Payment 
Date and the interest received from the Shares and Certificates, prior to the 
initial Payment Date. 
The Subordinated Loan shall accrue an annual variable interest rate every 
quarter, equal to the Reference Interest Rate of the Bonds fixed for each  
Interest Accrual Period plus a spread of 0.75%. Such interest will be paid only 
if the Fund has sufficient liquid funds in accordance with the Priority Ranking 
of Payments of the Fund. The interest will be paid on each of the Payment 
Dates and will be calculated taking as a basis : (i) the days effectively existing 
in each Interest Accrual Period  and (ii) a year consisting of three hundred and 
sixty (360) days. The payment of said interest shall be subject to the Priority 
Ranking described in section 3.4.6.2. of the Additional Module. 
 
The Subordinated Loan shall mature on the liquidation date of the Fund.  
Nevertheless, the Subordinated Loan may be freely amortised on each Payment 
Date, and the Sociedad Gestora shall decide the amount which shall be assigned 
for such amortisation, based on the estimated resources required to cover the 
differences between the accruals and collections from the Shares and 
Certificates of  the Securization Fund. 
Lack of confirmation prior to the start of the Subscription Period of any of the 
provisional ratings granted to the Bonds by the Credit Rating Agencies will 
constitute an event for terminating the Subordinated Loan Contract.

Interest Swap Contract 
The Sociedad Gestora shall enter into a Swap or Interest Swap Contract, for and 
on behalf of CAM, with the most significant features described below.

changing benchmark interest rates and revisions periods, and also from the 
liquidation of the variable interest rate fixed on each Series of Bonds that are 
issued for the account of the Fund;  and on the other hand, the risk related with 
the Shares and Certificates, which being subject to renegotiation, in accordance 
with the Rules and Regulations on  mortgage loan subrogation and

Party B: Caja de Ahorros del Mediterráneo. 
Liquidation Dates: The Liquidation Dates shall coincide with the Payment 
Dates of the Bonds, that is, on January 26, April 26, July 26 and October 26 of 
each year, or the following Business Day if these dates are not a Business Day. 
The first Payment Date of the Fund shall be January 26, 2006. 
Liquidation Periods: The Liquidation Periods shall be the days effectively 
elapsed between two consecutive Liquidation Dates, including the first and 
excluding the second.  Exceptionally, the first Liquidation Period shall have a 
term equivalent to the days effectively elapsed from the Date of Constitution 
(inclusive) and January 26, 2006 (exclusive). 
Amounts payable by Party A: On each Liquidation Date of the Interest Swap 
Contract, Party A shall pay the amounts payable by Party A, which equal the 
sum of the interest on the Shares and Certificates paid by the debtors during the 
three Collection Periods immediately preceding the corresponding Payment 
Date, and which correspond to those effectively transferred to the Fund. 
Amounts payable by Party B: On each Liquidation Date of the Interest Swap 
Contract, Party B shall pay the amounts payable by Party B, which equal the 
result of recalculating the payment of interest of the amounts payable by Party 
A, which shall be settled on the same date the amount due by Party B is paid B 
and the sum to which it amounts on the respective Payment Date, the la 
commission due by virtue of the Management Contract for the new Manager in 
the event the Seller is replaced as the Manager of the Mortgage Loans pooled in

Party B shall be equal to the Reference Interest Rate of the Bonds for the 
current Interest Accrual Period plus the average margin of the Bonds weighted 
by the Nominal Balance pending collection of the Bonds on the Determination 
Date immediately preceding the corresponding Payment Date, plus 0.67%.

amounts payable by Party A shall be subject to the Priority Order of Payments 
provided in section  3.4.6.2. of the Additional Module.

resources to pay the amount due to Party B,  the Interest Swap Contract may be 
terminated. In this payment of the Amount Payable by Party A shall be made in 
accordance with the Payments Priority Order.  In the event of termination, the 
Fund shall, if necessary, undertake the obligation to pay the liquidative amount 
due under the terms of the Interest Swap Contract.  Without predudice to the

above, except in a permanent situation of alteration of the financial equilibrium 
of the Fund, the Sociedad Gestora, for and on behalf of the Fund, shall attempt 
to contract a new Interest Swap Contract. 
If on a Due Date, Party B does not have sufficient funds available to pay, either 
partially or in full, the amount owing to Party A, the Sociedad Gestora may 
terminate the Interest Swap Contract.  If the Sociedad Gestora exercises this 
early termination option, it must find another credit institution to substitute 
Party B as soon as possible.  In this case, Pary B shall undertake, if appropriate, 
the payment obligation of the liquidative amount foreseen, under the terms of 
the Interest Swap Contract.  
The liquidation payment will be calculated by the Sociedad Gestora, in its 
capacity as the Interest Swap Contract’s calculation agent, using the market 
value of the Interest Swap Contract. 
Without prejudice to the above, the Sociedad Gestora will attempt to contract a 
new Interest Swap Contract on behalf of the Fund and at its expense, except in 
the event of a permanent change in the financial equilibrium of the Fund. 
          Rating changes. 
In the event that the long term debt rating for Party B´s unsecured, 
unsubordinated debt is downgraded to below A1 for Moody, and/or below A for 
long term debt and/or F1 for short term debt for Fitch, or if one of the Rating 
Agencies withdraws their rating, at any time in the life of the Bonds and for 
whatever reason, CAM will provide an irrevocable undertaking to implement 
within a maximum time period of thirty (30) days, starting from when said 
circumstances occurred, one of the following options under the terms and 
conditions that the Sociedad Gestora deems appropriate, and to notify the 
Rating Agencies, in order to maintain the ratings assigned to each of the series: 
a) to find a third party, that has a long term debt rating equal to or greater 
than A1 for its unsecured, unsubordinated debt on Moody’s rating scale, and 
of A for long term debt and F1 for short term debt on Fitch’s rating scale, to 
stand as surety for the performance of its contractual obligations.  
b) to find a third party that has the same ratings as option (i) above that will 
take over its contractual obligations and substitute the Interest Swap 
Contract either before the contract with Party B is terminated or, where 
applicable, by virtue of a new Interest Swap Contract; or 
c) to constitute a cash or securities deposit in favour of the Fund, in an 
account opened in another entity which has a short term risk rating of P-1 for 
Moody, and of F1 for Fitch, as a guarantee for the contractual obligations of 
Party B. The amount will be calculated using the market value of the Interest 
Swap Contract, and will be at least the replacement value of the Interest 
Swap Contract so as not to impair the rating assigned to the Bonds by the 
Rating Agencies. Moreover, and where applicable, depending on the rating

All costs, expenses and taxes incurred as a result of non-compliance of  the 
above obligations will be borne by Party B. 
          Maturity of the Contract 
The early termination of the Interest Swap Contract will not in itself constitute a 
reason for the early maturity of the Fund, or its Early Liquidation, unless the 
termination occurs in conjunction with other events or circumstances related to 
the Fund’s net worth, producing a substantial or permanent change in its 
financial equilibrium. 
The maturity of the Interest Swap Contract will take place on the earliest date 
between (i) the Legal Maturity Date of the Fund and (ii) the Termination Date

described in contracts which the Fund has entered into, and which are listed in this 
Prospectus. 
3.7.1.  Management and custody of the Mortgage Loans and custody of the 
Mortgage Transfer Certificates. 
Pursuant to article 61.3 of Royal Decree 685/1982, and section 2.b) of article 2 of Royal 
Decree 926/1998, the Seller undertakes, by virtue of the Deed of Constitution of the 
Fund, to safeguard and manage the Mortgage Loans that provide coverage for the Shares 
and Certificates it has issued. It is required to take whatever actions are necessary for the 
effective collection of said Mortgage Loans. The Sociedad Gestora, on behalf of the 
Fund, shall exercise the rights that the holders of the Shares and Certificates are entitled 
to under article 66 of Royal Decree 685/1982, in the event of non-compliance resulting 
from the Mortgage Debtors defaulting on their payments, at all times. 
All direct and indirect taxes, charges or expenses accrued and incurred by the Seller, or 
those that must be passed on in relation to the provision of administrative services for the 
Mortgage Loans, will be borne by the Seller, without prejudice to its right to receive 
reimbursement from the borrowers or from the Fund, where applicable. 
General commitments of the Seller in its capacity as Mortgage Loans manager 
In general, the Seller, in relation to the Mortgage Loans that it manages, provides 
an undertaking to the Sociedad Gestora and to the Fund that it will: 
(i) 
take whatever actions are necessary to ensure the performance of the Mortgage 
Loans, including judicial and extrajudicial proceedings, in accordance with the 
conditions outlined in the following section. 
(ii) 
take whatever actions are necessary to maintain and execute the guarantees and 
obligations arising from the Mortgage Loans.  
(iii) 
take into account the interests of the holders of the Bonds issued by the Fund in 
their relations with the borrowers, and in the exercise of any discretional power 
derived from the performance of the services specified in the Deed of Constitution 
and this Prospectus. 
(iv) 
carry out all instructions from the Sociedad Gestora, pursuant to the provisions of 
the Deed of Constitution and this Prospectus. 
(v) 
obtain and maintain valid any licenses, approvals, authorizations and consents that 
may be needed to carry out the provisions of the Deed of Constitution and this 
Prospectus. 
(vi) 
have sufficient equipment and personnel to fulfil all its obligations. 
The Seller, in its capacity as Mortgage Loans manager, shall not be liable for any of the 
debts of the Sociedad Gestora or the Fund, in relation to the Bonds, or the obligations of 
any mortgage debtor. The Manager in all cases waives its right to the privileges and

faculties conferred upon it by the law in its capacity as collection manager of the Fund 
and manager of the Mortgage Loans and in particular, all those provided for by articles  
1730 and 1780 of the Civil Code and 276 of the Commercial Code.  
Specifically, the Seller, in its capacity as Mortgage Loans manager, shall not be liable for 
any loss, liability, claim or expense suffered or incurred by the Sociedad Gestora, or by 
the Fund, as a result of the provision of services by the Seller as established in the Deed 
of Constitution and this Prospectus, except when said loss, liability, claim or expense or 
damages is suffered or incurred as a result of negligence or non-compliance by the Seller 
in respect of the Shares and Certificates that it manages, or non-compliance by the Seller 
of its obligations by virtue of the Deed of Constitution and this Prospectus. In these 
events the Seller is required to compensate the Fund or the Sociedad Gestora for the 
damages suffered (and justified by the Sociedad Gestora) as a consequence of said 
negligence or non-compliance. 
At all events, the Fund, through the Sociedad Gestora, may take legal action against the 
Seller in the event of non-compliance of its obligations as defined in the contracts entered 
into with the Sociedad Gestora. 
Mortgage Loans Management Services 
1. 
Custody and collection management 
The Seller will dedicate the same amount of time and attention to the Mortgage Loans 
management, and exercise the same degree of expertise, care and diligence in their 
management, that it would employ in the management of mortgage loans that had not 
been transferred. In any event, it will exercise a reasonable degree of expertise, care and 
diligence when providing the services. 
The Seller, in respect of the Mortgage Loans it manages, shall be authorised to modify the 
criteria employed in their management, and which can be found in the “Internal 
Memorandum on Mortgage Loan Granting”, included as an annexe to the  Deed of 
Constitution, provided that said modifications do not negatively affect the management of 
the Mortgage Loans, the Sociedad Gestora is notified, and they do not impair the rating 
assigned to the Bonds by the Rating Agencies in any way whatsoever and in addition, 
provided this is subject to the limits of negotiation specified in paragraphs 6, 7 and 8 of 
this section. 
In particular, the Seller shall keep all the deeds, documents and files of the 
Mortgage Loans it manages, any other ancillary rights to the Mortgage Loans, and 
any other documents relating to them in safe custody, and shall not relinquish the 
possession, custody or control of them without the prior written consent of the 
Sociedad Gestora, on behalf of the Fund, unless (i) it is in favour of a subcontractor 
or appointed delegate and it is permitted by the legislation in force or (ii) to allow 
the Seller, in its capacity as Mortgage Loans manager, to foreclose on a Mortgage 
Loan. 
The Seller, in its capacity as Mortgage Loans manager, will continue to collect the 
amounts due by virtue of the Mortgage Loans, or by any other ancillary right, and

"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores" (the Spanish Securities Market Commission, "CNMV") on October 4, 2005. The

107
will do its utmost to ensure that all the payments to be made by the borrowers, or 
other persons, by virtue of the Mortgage Loans, or by any other ancillary right, are 
collected in accordance with the terms and conditions of said Mortgage Loans, on 
the applicable dates.  
In the event of discrepancies arising between the Seller and the Sociedad Gestora 
with regard to the amount that the Seller should deliver to the Fund on each 
Collection Date, including both the amount collected and the Technical Advance, 
both sides will endeavour to settle said discrepancies. However, if they fail to reach 
an agreement on the matter prior to the Collection Date, the Seller will make a 
provisional payment to the Fund of the amount established by the Sociedad 
Gestora, which will be fully accredited to the Seller, without prejudice to the fact 
that an adjustment to said amount may subsequently be agreed upon. 
2. Action against debtors 
In the event of the mortgage debtors defaulting on their payments, the Seller, in its 
capacity as Mortgage Loans manager, will act in accordance with the “Internal 
Memorandum on Mortgage Loan Granting”, included as an annexe to the Deed. To 
this end, it will take the measures that would be taken by a reasonably prudent 
mortgage lender who carried out financing operations in Spain. The exercise of 
these discretionary powers should not affect the Fund’s management, nor the rating 
assigned to the Bonds by the Rating Agencies. 
At all events, in the event that a debtor of the Mortgage Loans that cover the issue 
of the Shares and Certificates pooled in the Fund defaults, it falls to the Sociedad 
Gestor, on behalf of the Fund, in its capacity as holder, to exercise all the powers 
established in article 66 of Royal Decree 685/1982. 
In the event of a competitive situation as regulated in section b) of article 66 of 
Royal Decree 685/1982, the right to adjudicate will be exercised by the Fund, and 
the proceeds from the auction will be allocated as stipulated in the aforementioned 
article. 
In the event that any of the situations described in sections c) and d) of article 66 of 
Royal Decree 685/1982 occur and, as a consequence, the Sociedad Gestora, on 
behalf of the Fund, is subrogated to the Seller in the proceedings initiated by the 
Seller, or foreclosure proceedings are started, the Sociedad Gestora will sell the 
adjudicated properties in the shortest possible time at market conditions. The Seller 
may invoke a preemption provision to purchase the properties mortgaged in 
guarantee of the Mortgage Loans that it manages, and that are adjudicated to the 
Fund, in the ten (10) Working Days following the date on which the Sociedad 
Gestora officially notifies it of the intention to transfer the properties. The 
preemption provision will entitle the Seller to acquire the properties under the same 
conditions as they were offered to the Sociedad Gestora. 
All the actions relating to the Shares and Certificates described in this section will 
be carried out in accordance with Heading IV, Book III of the Ley de 
Enjuiciamiento Civil 1/2000 and Royal Decree 685/1982. 


This prospectus is a translation into English of the original "Folleto" drafted in Spanish language and registered with the 
"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores" (the Spanish Securities Market Commission, "CNMV") on October 4, 2005. The 
"Folleto" drafted in the Spanish language is the only official document, and no document other than the "Folleto" shall have any 
legal effect or be relied upon with regard to the Note Issue. 
 
108
3. Action against the Seller 
The Sociedad Gestora, on behalf of the Fund and at its expense, may initiate 
enforcement proceedings against the Seller to guarantee the maturities of the 
Mortgage Loans both for principal and interest, when the non-payment of such 
amounts is not the result of non-payment by the Mortgage Debtors. 
Furthermore, in the event that the Seller does not fulfil its obligations of the 
previous section, the Fund, through the Sociedad Gestora, may take action for a 
declaratory judgement against the Seller for failure to comply with its obligations 
in relation to the Mortgage Loans. The preceding actions shall be conducted in 
accordance with the pertinent procedures laid down in the Ley de Enjuiciamiento 
Civil. 
Following the termination of the Mortgage Loans , the Fund, through the Sociedad 
Gestora, will maintain legal action against the Seller until its obligations have been 
fulfilled. 
4. Subcontracting 
The Seller will be authorised, with respect to the Mortgage Loans that it manages, 
provided that it is permitted by the legislation in force, to subcontract or delegate to 
third parties of recognised solvency and capacity the performance of the functions 
described in section 3.7.1. of this Additional Module, as long as (i) it is legally 
possible, (ii) the CNMV has been notified in advance and, where applicable, the 
applicable authorizations have been obtained, (iii) the Sociedad Gestora has given 
its prior consent in writing, on behalf of the Fund (iv) the subcontractor or 
delegated party has, where applicable, a rating that does not impair the rating of the 
Bonds by the Rating Agencies, and provided that (v) said subcontractor or 
delegated party has waived all rights of recourse against the Fund, as well as the 
right to terminate said subcontracts and/or delegations. 
At no time will the Sociedad Gestora, or the Fund, accept any additional liability 
other than that which has been accepted by virtue of the provisions described 
herein, with respect to costs or expenses owing or incurred due to subcontracting or 
delegation, or that arise out of the termination of said contracts. 
Notwithstanding the existence of any subcontracts or delegations, the Seller shall 
be neither exonerated nor discharged by virtue of said subcontracts or delegations 
from any of its responsibilities as established in the Deed of Constitution and this 
Prospectus. 
5. Substitution of the Seller in its capacity as Mortgage Loans manager 
In the event that the Sociedad Gestora establishes the failure of the Seller to fulfil 
its obligations, as set out in this section, as Mortgage Loans manager, or the 
occurrence of an event that, in the opinion of the Sociedad Gestora, could   impair 
or put at risk the financial structure of the Fund, or the rights and interests of the  
Bondholders, the Sociedad Gestora may, in accordance with the legislation in 
force, (i) replace the Seller as the Shares and Certificates manager or (ii) request

109
the Seller to subcontract or delegate the performance of said obligations to an 
entity that, in the opinion of the Sociedad Gestora, has the technical capacity to 
undertake said functions. The Sociedad Gestora will take into account the 
proposals of the Seller with regard to the appointment of its replacement. The 
Seller is required to carry out said subcontracting or delegation. 
Furthermore, if a corporate, legal or judicial decision is taken on the liquidation, 
dissolution or intervention of the Seller, or the Seller applies to be declared legally 
bankrupt, or an application presented by a third party is given leave to proceed, the 
Sociedad Gestora will replace the Seller as Mortgage Loans manager, if permitted 
by the applicable legislation.  
If permitted by the applicable legislation, the new Mortgage Loans manager shall, 
where appropriate, be appointed by the Sociedad Gestora, after the competent 
administrative authorities have been consulted, and provided that the rating 
assigned to the Bonds by the Rating Agencies is not negatively affected. Both the 
Agencies and the CNMV shall be notified of said appointment. The Sociedad 
Gestora shall agree with the new manager upon the amount to be received, to be 
borne by the Fund, which it deems suitable. Said amount will be considered to be 
an Extraordinary Expense and will be paid according to the Priority Order of 
Payments described in section 3.4.6.2. of the Additional Module. 
If permitted by the applicable legislation, the Seller may request to be replaced as 
Mortgage Loans manager, and all expenses arising out of said replacement    will 
be borne by the Seller. The Sociedad Gestora shall authorise said replacement as 
long as the Seller has found an entity that will take over its management functions, 
and the rating assigned to the Bonds by the Rating Agencies is not impaired. The 
Rating Agencies and the CNMV shall be notified of said appointment.  
In the event of substitution, the Seller will forward to the new manager all the 
documents necessary for the performance of its activities. 
6. Modifications to the Mortgage Loans 
In accordance with the provisions of article 25 of Royal Decree 685/1982, the 
Seller is not authorised to voluntarily cancel the mortgages underlying the 
Mortgage Loans that it manages without the consent of the Sociedad Gestora, for 
any reason other than payment of the Mortgage Loans, nor may it waive or 
compound them, make a novation of the Mortgage Loans, write them off partially 
or in full, or prorogue them nor, in general, take any action that might decrease the 
rank, legal efficiency or financial value of the mortgages or the Mortgage Loans, 
except by the authorised modifications outlined in the following paragraphs. 
The Seller, in its capacity as Mortgage Loans manager, shall, from the Constitution 
Date of the Fund, and as long the rating assigned to the Bonds is not impaired, the 
payments to the Fund are not negatively affected and notice is given to the 
Sociedad Gestora, and by the latter to the Rating Agencies, be authorised, with 
respect to said Mortgage Loans, to:

(i) 
allow subrogations of the Mortgage Loan Contracts provided that 
the characteristics of the new debtor are similar to those of the 
previous one, and comply with the criteria contained in the 
“Internal Memorandum on Mortgage Loan Granting” by the Seller. 
Where applicable, the Seller will issue a new multiple security with 
the details of the subrogation effected. 
(ii) 
agree upon changes to the interest rates and the final redemption 
date of the Mortgage Loans with the Mortgage Debtors, in 
accordance with the following points.  
7. Changes in the interest rates: 
In accordance with the Deed of Constitution and this Prospectus, in the event 
that the Seller agrees to a change in the interest rate on a Mortgage Loan, and 
consequently a change in the interest rate of its corresponding Share or 
Certificate, the ordinary interest accrued by the Mortgage Loan will still 
correspond to the Fund.
